 <sinopse>
  A woman leaves an Austrian convent to become a governess to the children of a Naval officer widower.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In 1930's Austria, a young woman named Maria is failing miserably in her attempts to become a nun. When the Navy captain Georg Von Trapp writes to the convent asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. The Captain's wife is dead, and he is often away, and runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that their father keeps hiring, and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws them to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives -- including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though Georg is already engaged to a Baroness and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made. Their personal conflicts soon become ...

    The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness. It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner. 8/10

    This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.

    Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film  it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike. The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria  she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps  firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace. From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent  Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors  so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films  are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.

    What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me. And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades. How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic? Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie. It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so. I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people. When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.

    I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had "gone viral" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately "The Sound of Music" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule. But I digress. To the film. This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled "The Family Von Trapp", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence. I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I "paid homage" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of "that musical movie is silly and stupid" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us "West Side Story", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Desert Rats" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to name but a few of his landmark films. Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness. The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the "Sound of Music". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one. Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how "realisitic" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake. Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give "The Sound of Music" a chance. Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

    it is a sentimental piece. it is not important not performance or music or images or adaptation of real facts. it remains only a ball of feelings in music sauce. it is not great or impressive. only a legend. with honest humor as blood, with charming presence of Julie Andrews, with stains of dark, with touching circle of a mythical family. after so many years and views , it is difficult to criticize it.because Sound of music is a state of soul. unrealistic, almost kitsch, gay or fake, it is always seductive like song for a cobra in Indian market. the recipes is perfect, ingredients - tasty, and the cook - inspired. so, the delight is fresh. like sparkle of an old period when miracles are ordinaries events.

    Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed. PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments. CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too. MESSAGE: "Be cheerful" VERDICT: "Most Recommended."

    The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Every Mountain." Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.

    There are people saying this is not "realistic..!!!". (and their right) Well....Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Spiderman...Etc. Etc. Etc. are also in that category. Also---people never spontaneously burst into song---do they .?? I don't think director Robert Wise was going for realism when he made this. He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when "musicals" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films.

    A microcosm of the idealistic and affluent Austria is The Von Tropp children, who are trapped in their mansion by their Navy Captain father, not quite got over the death of his wife. When along comes "innocent nun wash out" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.

Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic? Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie. It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so. I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people. When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.

    I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had "gone viral" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately "The Sound of Music" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule. But I digress. To the film. This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled "The Family Von Trapp", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence. I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I "paid homage" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of "that musical movie is silly and stupid" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us "West Side Story", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Desert Rats" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to name but a few of his landmark films. Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness. The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the "Sound of Music". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one. Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how "realisitic" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake. Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give "The Sound of Music" a chance. Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

    Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed. PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments. CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too. MESSAGE: "Be cheerful" VERDICT: "Most Recommended."

    The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Every Mountain." Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.

    There are people saying this is not "realistic..!!!". (and their right) Well....Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Spiderman...Etc. Etc. Etc. are also in that category. Also---people never spontaneously burst into song---do they .?? I don't think director Robert Wise was going for realism when he made this. He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when "musicals" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films.

    A microcosm of the idealistic and affluent Austria is The Von Tropp children, who are trapped in their mansion by their Navy Captain father, not quite got over the death of his wife. When along comes "innocent nun wash out" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.

    The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness. It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner. 8/10

    This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.

    Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film  it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike. The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria  she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps  firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace. From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent  Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors  so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films  are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.

    What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me. And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades. How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal.

    There are people saying this is not "realistic..!!!". (and their right) Well....Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Spiderman...Etc. Etc. Etc. are also in that category. Also---people never spontaneously burst into song---do they .?? I don't think director Robert Wise was going for realism when he made this. He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when "musicals" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films.

    A microcosm of the idealistic and affluent Austria is The Von Tropp children, who are trapped in their mansion by their Navy Captain father, not quite got over the death of his wife. When along comes "innocent nun wash out" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.

    The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness. It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner. 8/10

    This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.

    Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film  it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike. The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria  she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps  firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace. From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent  Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors  so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films  are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.

    What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me. And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades. How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic? Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie. It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so. I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people. When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.

    I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had "gone viral" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately "The Sound of Music" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule. But I digress. To the film. This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled "The Family Von Trapp", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence. I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I "paid homage" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of "that musical movie is silly and stupid" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us "West Side Story", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Desert Rats" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to name but a few of his landmark films. Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness. The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the "Sound of Music". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one. Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how "realisitic" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake. Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give "The Sound of Music" a chance. Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

    it is a sentimental piece. it is not important not performance or music or images or adaptation of real facts. it remains only a ball of feelings in music sauce. it is not great or impressive. only a legend. with honest humor as blood, with charming presence of Julie Andrews, with stains of dark, with touching circle of a mythical family. after so many years and views , it is difficult to criticize it.because Sound of music is a state of soul. unrealistic, almost kitsch, gay or fake, it is always seductive like song for a cobra in Indian market. the recipes is perfect, ingredients - tasty, and the cook - inspired. so, the delight is fresh. like sparkle of an old period when miracles are ordinaries events.

    Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed. PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments. CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too. MESSAGE: "Be cheerful" VERDICT: "Most Recommended."

    The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Every Mountain." Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.

Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie. It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so. I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people. When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.

    I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had "gone viral" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately "The Sound of Music" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule. But I digress. To the film. This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled "The Family Von Trapp", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence. I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I "paid homage" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of "that musical movie is silly and stupid" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us "West Side Story", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Desert Rats" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to name but a few of his landmark films. Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness. The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the "Sound of Music". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one. Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how "realisitic" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake. Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give "The Sound of Music" a chance. Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

    Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed. PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments. CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too. MESSAGE: "Be cheerful" VERDICT: "Most Recommended."

    The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Every Mountain." Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.

    There are people saying this is not "realistic..!!!". (and their right) Well....Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Spiderman...Etc. Etc. Etc. are also in that category. Also---people never spontaneously burst into song---do they .?? I don't think director Robert Wise was going for realism when he made this. He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when "musicals" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films.

    A microcosm of the idealistic and affluent Austria is The Von Tropp children, who are trapped in their mansion by their Navy Captain father, not quite got over the death of his wife. When along comes "innocent nun wash out" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.

    The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness. It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner. 8/10

    This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.

    Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film  it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike. The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria  she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps  firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace. From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent  Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors  so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films  are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.

    What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me. And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades. How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic?

    There are people saying this is not "realistic..!!!". (and their right) Well....Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Spiderman...Etc. Etc. Etc. are also in that category. Also---people never spontaneously burst into song---do they .?? I don't think director Robert Wise was going for realism when he made this. He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when "musicals" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films.

    A microcosm of the idealistic and affluent Austria is The Von Tropp children, who are trapped in their mansion by their Navy Captain father, not quite got over the death of his wife. When along comes "innocent nun wash out" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.

    The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness. It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner. 8/10

    This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.

    Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film  it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike. The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria  she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps  firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace. From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent  Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors  so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films  are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.

    What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me. And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades. How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic? Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie. It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so. I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people. When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.

    I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had "gone viral" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately "The Sound of Music" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule. But I digress. To the film. This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled "The Family Von Trapp", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence. I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I "paid homage" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of "that musical movie is silly and stupid" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us "West Side Story", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Desert Rats" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to name but a few of his landmark films. Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness. The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the "Sound of Music". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one. Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how "realisitic" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake. Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give "The Sound of Music" a chance. Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

    it is a sentimental piece. it is not important not performance or music or images or adaptation of real facts. it remains only a ball of feelings in music sauce. it is not great or impressive. only a legend. with honest humor as blood, with charming presence of Julie Andrews, with stains of dark, with touching circle of a mythical family. after so many years and views , it is difficult to criticize it.because Sound of music is a state of soul. unrealistic, almost kitsch, gay or fake, it is always seductive like song for a cobra in Indian market. the recipes is perfect, ingredients - tasty, and the cook - inspired. so, the delight is fresh. like sparkle of an old period when miracles are ordinaries events.

    Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed. PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments. CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too. MESSAGE: "Be cheerful" VERDICT: "Most Recommended."

    The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Every Mountain." Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.

It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so. I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people. When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.

    I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had "gone viral" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately "The Sound of Music" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule. But I digress. To the film. This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled "The Family Von Trapp", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence. I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I "paid homage" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of "that musical movie is silly and stupid" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us "West Side Story", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Desert Rats" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to name but a few of his landmark films. Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness. The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the "Sound of Music". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one. Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how "realisitic" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake. Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give "The Sound of Music" a chance. Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

    Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed. PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments. CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too. MESSAGE: "Be cheerful" VERDICT: "Most Recommended."

    The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Every Mountain." Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.

    There are people saying this is not "realistic..!!!". (and their right) Well....Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Spiderman...Etc. Etc. Etc. are also in that category. Also---people never spontaneously burst into song---do they .?? I don't think director Robert Wise was going for realism when he made this. He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when "musicals" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films.

    A microcosm of the idealistic and affluent Austria is The Von Tropp children, who are trapped in their mansion by their Navy Captain father, not quite got over the death of his wife. When along comes "innocent nun wash out" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.

    The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness. It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner. 8/10

    This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.

    Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film  it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike. The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria  she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps  firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace. From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent  Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors  so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films  are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.

    What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me. And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades. How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic? Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie. It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so. I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people. When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.

Also---people never spontaneously burst into song---do they .?? I don't think director Robert Wise was going for realism when he made this. He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when "musicals" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films.

    A microcosm of the idealistic and affluent Austria is The Von Tropp children, who are trapped in their mansion by their Navy Captain father, not quite got over the death of his wife. When along comes "innocent nun wash out" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.

    The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness. It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner. 8/10

    This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.

    Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film  it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike. The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria  she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps  firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace. From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent  Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors  so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films  are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.

    What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me. And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades. How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic? Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie. It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so. I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people. When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.

    I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had "gone viral" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately "The Sound of Music" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule. But I digress. To the film. This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled "The Family Von Trapp", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence. I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I "paid homage" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of "that musical movie is silly and stupid" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us "West Side Story", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Desert Rats" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to name but a few of his landmark films. Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness. The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the "Sound of Music". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one. Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how "realisitic" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake. Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give "The Sound of Music" a chance. Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

    it is a sentimental piece. it is not important not performance or music or images or adaptation of real facts. it remains only a ball of feelings in music sauce. it is not great or impressive. only a legend. with honest humor as blood, with charming presence of Julie Andrews, with stains of dark, with touching circle of a mythical family. after so many years and views , it is difficult to criticize it.because Sound of music is a state of soul. unrealistic, almost kitsch, gay or fake, it is always seductive like song for a cobra in Indian market. the recipes is perfect, ingredients - tasty, and the cook - inspired. so, the delight is fresh. like sparkle of an old period when miracles are ordinaries events.

    Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed. PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments. CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too. MESSAGE: "Be cheerful" VERDICT: "Most Recommended."

    The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Every Mountain." Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.
