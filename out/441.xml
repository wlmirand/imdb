 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Based on a true story that was claimed by writer Jay Anson, The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newly weds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house but it ends up in terror. Despite full disclosure by the real estate agent of the home's history, George and Kathy buy the house. George says, "Houses don't have memories," but they turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house. But the evil spirit in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very ill. George and Kathy with the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective they face the fears of the house, but not knowing the spirit is planning to possess George and then the children...

    Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. In the movie, George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Their family priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that.

    This is one of the very few Horror Films that you may see people be bipolar around. Tons hate it, tons love it. Me? I didn't hate it, but I didn't care for it all. My main problem with Amityville Horror is that it's way too boring. It often moved like molasses for me. The house is creepy enough by itself, that it doesn't need a whole lot of other theatrics. But a consistent pace would have certainly helped matters. There is always suspension of disbelief when it comes to Horror movies, but I had trouble with a lot of the stuff that commenced in this movie. Why did the family take so long to stay in that house? I would have been gone at the first sign of trouble. Could Rod Steiger have been any more hammier as the priest? I dig intensity, but don't overact with it. It was embarrassing. The little subplot between the priests just didn't interest me. The good thing about this movie is the two leads. James Brolin is the reason I stuck with this movie as long as I did. That epic beard to go along with his creepily intense show was great stuff. The Brolin rocks! I've always dug Margot Kidder, despite her reputation. She played the caring wife to a T. Final Thoughts: Boring and overlong to boot. The only reason to see this is James Brolin's terrific performance. I would recommend the remake over this one. It's not great, but at least it's fairly entertaining. This is a mediocre film with very little entertainment or thrills 4/10

    Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away. This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one. The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything.

    This movie sticks fairly close to Jay Anson's novelized account of the Lutz family's ordeal at 112 Ocean Avenue. There are some slight changes, as noted in other reviews, to heighten dramatic effect; however, none as horribly disfigured as the 2005 remake, which completely obliterated the "known" facts about the incident. My problems with it, personally, are their choice of Margot Kidder to play Kathleen Lutz. I didn't even care for her performances in the Superman franchise. Just something about her rubs me the wrong way. Much of the incidents revealed in the novel were omitted from the movie mostly because it was a low-budget film, the last from MGM before they merged, and the money just wasn't there to make it into a high-grade spectacle that would do it justice. Still, stripped to the bare bones, it conveys the basic message of the story and, in my opinion, is the best of the entire Amityville franchise. My suggestion: read the book first!

    For those of us who read Jay Anson's book before seeing the film, the success of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR rather depends on how much of the book you believe, a question I have been wrestling with since 1977 and to this day I have not been able to decide. There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show "In Search Of..."; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed: That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened. The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened. Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous. In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary. Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clich&eacute;s of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question: SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it. The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale. Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.

    Call me a sucker for the 70s New Hollywood style, but I really dig the aesthetic for this film. Tellingly, this was released in 1979, and by this point that aesthetic had trickled down to even lowest-common-denominator genre films... for the better, I would argue. The Amityville Horror, like The Exorcist before it, situates itself in the idyllic, almost rustic, family life that it will soon reveal as harbouring a deep violence. A slow pacing also benefits The Amityville Horror, showing the gradual transformation of Josh Brolin's George into a territorial madman. Ironically, this film was blasted as being mindless violence when it was first released, but now it seems more cerebral and deliberate than the bulk of popular movies today. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination -- the characters are two-dimensional and the acting doesn't help, and the conclusion in particular seems rushed. Other than the genuinely frightening bits with the flies, the movie is never able to really deliver the scares it hints at. To call this a horror classic is to perhaps do a disservice to the horror genre. But despite all this, it's not such a bad movie after all, and certainly deserves more than the initial round of condemnation. The Amityville Horror is a good evening of genre entertainment, providing a little to think on while the bodily thrills get to you, and that's all that we can really ask from a movie.

    Would you move into a house knowing full well that it had been the site of a gruesome shotgun massacre thirteen months earlier? No, me neither, but that's what the Lutz family did in the winter of '75, spending less than a month in their new home before fleeing the property, claiming to have suffered a series of terrifying supernatural occurrences in the interim. Were the Lutz's brave, stupid, or simply after a lucrative book deal and a cut of the profits from the inevitable movie? You decide... The Amityville Horror, based on Jay Anson's best-selling account of the Lutz's ordeal, was one of the biggest horror hits of the 70s and has since spawned loads of sequels and a remake; it's an effectively creepy, well acted, and competently directed effort that succeeds in delivering a few scares and quite a bit of atmosphere, but it is also a rather frustrating affair, one that builds the tension to breaking point only to round things off with an anti-climactic ending that sees the Lutz family simply clearing out of the house, presumably in a hurry to get to the publishers and sign a deal for a sensational bestseller based on their experiences. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 purely for the scene where Margot Kidder does stretches.

    The American International production of "The Amityville Horror" is a decent enough horror flick that at the very least features one of the most distinctive and iconic residences, not just in horror cinema, but in real life. It sure makes for one Hell of a poster image. Many people by now are familiar with this notorious story, based on the incident of the alleged haunting of a Long Island house. A year after one of the residents shot the rest of his family to death, a new family moves in, including newlyweds George (played by James Brolin) and Kathy (played by Margot Kidder) and her three children from a previous marriage. Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies. A local priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger, who tears the scenery to pieces) becomes easily convinced that the house contains evil spirits and that the Lutz family is now in danger. Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.

    James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger star in director Stuart Rosenberg's 1979 thriller "The Amityville Horror", based on the alleged true story of the famed Amityville haunted house and the events that surrounded it. The film is a very well known haunted-house "classic", spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure but it didn't seem all that special to me. It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing becoming more violent. The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic "singing girls" theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force. The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems. I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be a bit boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

    I just visited the actual house in Amityville, NY, and then I watched the original film. Terrible, but not totally unwatchable, film. Nothing "scary", just a lot of doors and windows bangin' shut, flies, sludge in toilets, the daughter has a (supposedly) imaginary evil friend, and a "red room" is discovered in the basement. Rather dull and much too long at 2+ hours. Of course the actors (James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger) totally emote. The most hilarious scene is of the braces-wearing, pony-tailed babysitter getting locked in a closet. The door slams shut behind her and she can't get out. So what does she do? She doesn't try to push the door open using her full body weight. Instead she pounds and knocks on the door over and over while sobbing. Oh yeah, THAT'S how you open a stuck door! FAKE. The movie was filmed in Toms River, NJ, *not* at the actual house in Amityville, NY. It's so obvious (to me) that the movie house isn't the real thing. The movie house's crescent-shaped windows are HUGE, the crescent-shaped windows face the water (river) in back of the house and not the street (as they did in real life), and the movie house's yard is much larger than the real life house's yard. FAKE. Plus in real life, the Lutz family lived in the house from mid-December 1975 until late January 1976. But in the film there is no snow, there is no Christmas tree in the house, and everyone is outside without coats on. FAKE. I think in real life the married couple concocted the "evilness" with the help of their priest. I wonder how the three individuals came into contact with the book's author and how much the three individuals were paid for their collaboration (conspiracy). I think the REAL story, if there is an actual "real" story, is that the married couple could not handle the psychological burden of knowing that they were living in a house where six murders took place only one year before they moved in. At first they were happy to buy the house at such a good (heavily discounted) price but slowly they came to grips with the eeriness of living in such an infamous place. I want to remake the film and focus the story on how the family (and priest) became more and more unhinged by this psychological burden and NOT by clich&eacute;d acts of the devil they supposedly witnessed.

In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary. Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clich&eacute;s of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question: SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it. The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale. Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.

    Call me a sucker for the 70s New Hollywood style, but I really dig the aesthetic for this film. Tellingly, this was released in 1979, and by this point that aesthetic had trickled down to even lowest-common-denominator genre films... for the better, I would argue. The Amityville Horror, like The Exorcist before it, situates itself in the idyllic, almost rustic, family life that it will soon reveal as harbouring a deep violence. A slow pacing also benefits The Amityville Horror, showing the gradual transformation of Josh Brolin's George into a territorial madman. Ironically, this film was blasted as being mindless violence when it was first released, but now it seems more cerebral and deliberate than the bulk of popular movies today. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination -- the characters are two-dimensional and the acting doesn't help, and the conclusion in particular seems rushed. Other than the genuinely frightening bits with the flies, the movie is never able to really deliver the scares it hints at. To call this a horror classic is to perhaps do a disservice to the horror genre. But despite all this, it's not such a bad movie after all, and certainly deserves more than the initial round of condemnation. The Amityville Horror is a good evening of genre entertainment, providing a little to think on while the bodily thrills get to you, and that's all that we can really ask from a movie.

    Would you move into a house knowing full well that it had been the site of a gruesome shotgun massacre thirteen months earlier? No, me neither, but that's what the Lutz family did in the winter of '75, spending less than a month in their new home before fleeing the property, claiming to have suffered a series of terrifying supernatural occurrences in the interim. Were the Lutz's brave, stupid, or simply after a lucrative book deal and a cut of the profits from the inevitable movie? You decide... The Amityville Horror, based on Jay Anson's best-selling account of the Lutz's ordeal, was one of the biggest horror hits of the 70s and has since spawned loads of sequels and a remake; it's an effectively creepy, well acted, and competently directed effort that succeeds in delivering a few scares and quite a bit of atmosphere, but it is also a rather frustrating affair, one that builds the tension to breaking point only to round things off with an anti-climactic ending that sees the Lutz family simply clearing out of the house, presumably in a hurry to get to the publishers and sign a deal for a sensational bestseller based on their experiences. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 purely for the scene where Margot Kidder does stretches.

    The American International production of "The Amityville Horror" is a decent enough horror flick that at the very least features one of the most distinctive and iconic residences, not just in horror cinema, but in real life. It sure makes for one Hell of a poster image. Many people by now are familiar with this notorious story, based on the incident of the alleged haunting of a Long Island house. A year after one of the residents shot the rest of his family to death, a new family moves in, including newlyweds George (played by James Brolin) and Kathy (played by Margot Kidder) and her three children from a previous marriage. Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies. A local priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger, who tears the scenery to pieces) becomes easily convinced that the house contains evil spirits and that the Lutz family is now in danger. Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.

    James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger star in director Stuart Rosenberg's 1979 thriller "The Amityville Horror", based on the alleged true story of the famed Amityville haunted house and the events that surrounded it. The film is a very well known haunted-house "classic", spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure but it didn't seem all that special to me. It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing becoming more violent. The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic "singing girls" theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force. The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems. I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be a bit boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

    I just visited the actual house in Amityville, NY, and then I watched the original film. Terrible, but not totally unwatchable, film. Nothing "scary", just a lot of doors and windows bangin' shut, flies, sludge in toilets, the daughter has a (supposedly) imaginary evil friend, and a "red room" is discovered in the basement. Rather dull and much too long at 2+ hours. Of course the actors (James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger) totally emote. The most hilarious scene is of the braces-wearing, pony-tailed babysitter getting locked in a closet. The door slams shut behind her and she can't get out. So what does she do? She doesn't try to push the door open using her full body weight. Instead she pounds and knocks on the door over and over while sobbing. Oh yeah, THAT'S how you open a stuck door! FAKE. The movie was filmed in Toms River, NJ, *not* at the actual house in Amityville, NY. It's so obvious (to me) that the movie house isn't the real thing. The movie house's crescent-shaped windows are HUGE, the crescent-shaped windows face the water (river) in back of the house and not the street (as they did in real life), and the movie house's yard is much larger than the real life house's yard. FAKE. Plus in real life, the Lutz family lived in the house from mid-December 1975 until late January 1976. But in the film there is no snow, there is no Christmas tree in the house, and everyone is outside without coats on. FAKE. I think in real life the married couple concocted the "evilness" with the help of their priest. I wonder how the three individuals came into contact with the book's author and how much the three individuals were paid for their collaboration (conspiracy). I think the REAL story, if there is an actual "real" story, is that the married couple could not handle the psychological burden of knowing that they were living in a house where six murders took place only one year before they moved in. At first they were happy to buy the house at such a good (heavily discounted) price but slowly they came to grips with the eeriness of living in such an infamous place. I want to remake the film and focus the story on how the family (and priest) became more and more unhinged by this psychological burden and NOT by clich&eacute;d acts of the devil they supposedly witnessed.

    Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. In the movie, George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Their family priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that.

    This is one of the very few Horror Films that you may see people be bipolar around. Tons hate it, tons love it. Me? I didn't hate it, but I didn't care for it all. My main problem with Amityville Horror is that it's way too boring. It often moved like molasses for me. The house is creepy enough by itself, that it doesn't need a whole lot of other theatrics. But a consistent pace would have certainly helped matters. There is always suspension of disbelief when it comes to Horror movies, but I had trouble with a lot of the stuff that commenced in this movie. Why did the family take so long to stay in that house? I would have been gone at the first sign of trouble. Could Rod Steiger have been any more hammier as the priest? I dig intensity, but don't overact with it. It was embarrassing. The little subplot between the priests just didn't interest me. The good thing about this movie is the two leads. James Brolin is the reason I stuck with this movie as long as I did. That epic beard to go along with his creepily intense show was great stuff. The Brolin rocks! I've always dug Margot Kidder, despite her reputation. She played the caring wife to a T. Final Thoughts: Boring and overlong to boot. The only reason to see this is James Brolin's terrific performance. I would recommend the remake over this one. It's not great, but at least it's fairly entertaining. This is a mediocre film with very little entertainment or thrills 4/10

    Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away. This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one. The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything.

    This movie sticks fairly close to Jay Anson's novelized account of the Lutz family's ordeal at 112 Ocean Avenue. There are some slight changes, as noted in other reviews, to heighten dramatic effect; however, none as horribly disfigured as the 2005 remake, which completely obliterated the "known" facts about the incident. My problems with it, personally, are their choice of Margot Kidder to play Kathleen Lutz. I didn't even care for her performances in the Superman franchise. Just something about her rubs me the wrong way. Much of the incidents revealed in the novel were omitted from the movie mostly because it was a low-budget film, the last from MGM before they merged, and the money just wasn't there to make it into a high-grade spectacle that would do it justice. Still, stripped to the bare bones, it conveys the basic message of the story and, in my opinion, is the best of the entire Amityville franchise. My suggestion: read the book first!

    For those of us who read Jay Anson's book before seeing the film, the success of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR rather depends on how much of the book you believe, a question I have been wrestling with since 1977 and to this day I have not been able to decide. There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show "In Search Of..."; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed: That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened. The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened. Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous.

And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems. I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be a bit boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

    I just visited the actual house in Amityville, NY, and then I watched the original film. Terrible, but not totally unwatchable, film. Nothing "scary", just a lot of doors and windows bangin' shut, flies, sludge in toilets, the daughter has a (supposedly) imaginary evil friend, and a "red room" is discovered in the basement. Rather dull and much too long at 2+ hours. Of course the actors (James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger) totally emote. The most hilarious scene is of the braces-wearing, pony-tailed babysitter getting locked in a closet. The door slams shut behind her and she can't get out. So what does she do? She doesn't try to push the door open using her full body weight. Instead she pounds and knocks on the door over and over while sobbing. Oh yeah, THAT'S how you open a stuck door! FAKE. The movie was filmed in Toms River, NJ, *not* at the actual house in Amityville, NY. It's so obvious (to me) that the movie house isn't the real thing. The movie house's crescent-shaped windows are HUGE, the crescent-shaped windows face the water (river) in back of the house and not the street (as they did in real life), and the movie house's yard is much larger than the real life house's yard. FAKE. Plus in real life, the Lutz family lived in the house from mid-December 1975 until late January 1976. But in the film there is no snow, there is no Christmas tree in the house, and everyone is outside without coats on. FAKE. I think in real life the married couple concocted the "evilness" with the help of their priest. I wonder how the three individuals came into contact with the book's author and how much the three individuals were paid for their collaboration (conspiracy). I think the REAL story, if there is an actual "real" story, is that the married couple could not handle the psychological burden of knowing that they were living in a house where six murders took place only one year before they moved in. At first they were happy to buy the house at such a good (heavily discounted) price but slowly they came to grips with the eeriness of living in such an infamous place. I want to remake the film and focus the story on how the family (and priest) became more and more unhinged by this psychological burden and NOT by clich&eacute;d acts of the devil they supposedly witnessed.

    Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. In the movie, George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Their family priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that.

    This is one of the very few Horror Films that you may see people be bipolar around. Tons hate it, tons love it. Me? I didn't hate it, but I didn't care for it all. My main problem with Amityville Horror is that it's way too boring. It often moved like molasses for me. The house is creepy enough by itself, that it doesn't need a whole lot of other theatrics. But a consistent pace would have certainly helped matters. There is always suspension of disbelief when it comes to Horror movies, but I had trouble with a lot of the stuff that commenced in this movie. Why did the family take so long to stay in that house? I would have been gone at the first sign of trouble. Could Rod Steiger have been any more hammier as the priest? I dig intensity, but don't overact with it. It was embarrassing. The little subplot between the priests just didn't interest me. The good thing about this movie is the two leads. James Brolin is the reason I stuck with this movie as long as I did. That epic beard to go along with his creepily intense show was great stuff. The Brolin rocks! I've always dug Margot Kidder, despite her reputation. She played the caring wife to a T. Final Thoughts: Boring and overlong to boot. The only reason to see this is James Brolin's terrific performance. I would recommend the remake over this one. It's not great, but at least it's fairly entertaining. This is a mediocre film with very little entertainment or thrills 4/10

    Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away. This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one. The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything.

    This movie sticks fairly close to Jay Anson's novelized account of the Lutz family's ordeal at 112 Ocean Avenue. There are some slight changes, as noted in other reviews, to heighten dramatic effect; however, none as horribly disfigured as the 2005 remake, which completely obliterated the "known" facts about the incident. My problems with it, personally, are their choice of Margot Kidder to play Kathleen Lutz. I didn't even care for her performances in the Superman franchise. Just something about her rubs me the wrong way. Much of the incidents revealed in the novel were omitted from the movie mostly because it was a low-budget film, the last from MGM before they merged, and the money just wasn't there to make it into a high-grade spectacle that would do it justice. Still, stripped to the bare bones, it conveys the basic message of the story and, in my opinion, is the best of the entire Amityville franchise. My suggestion: read the book first!

    For those of us who read Jay Anson's book before seeing the film, the success of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR rather depends on how much of the book you believe, a question I have been wrestling with since 1977 and to this day I have not been able to decide. There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show "In Search Of..."; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed: That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened. The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened. Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous. In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary. Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clich&eacute;s of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question: SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it. The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale. Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.

    Call me a sucker for the 70s New Hollywood style, but I really dig the aesthetic for this film. Tellingly, this was released in 1979, and by this point that aesthetic had trickled down to even lowest-common-denominator genre films... for the better, I would argue. The Amityville Horror, like The Exorcist before it, situates itself in the idyllic, almost rustic, family life that it will soon reveal as harbouring a deep violence. A slow pacing also benefits The Amityville Horror, showing the gradual transformation of Josh Brolin's George into a territorial madman. Ironically, this film was blasted as being mindless violence when it was first released, but now it seems more cerebral and deliberate than the bulk of popular movies today. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination -- the characters are two-dimensional and the acting doesn't help, and the conclusion in particular seems rushed. Other than the genuinely frightening bits with the flies, the movie is never able to really deliver the scares it hints at. To call this a horror classic is to perhaps do a disservice to the horror genre. But despite all this, it's not such a bad movie after all, and certainly deserves more than the initial round of condemnation. The Amityville Horror is a good evening of genre entertainment, providing a little to think on while the bodily thrills get to you, and that's all that we can really ask from a movie.

    Would you move into a house knowing full well that it had been the site of a gruesome shotgun massacre thirteen months earlier? No, me neither, but that's what the Lutz family did in the winter of '75, spending less than a month in their new home before fleeing the property, claiming to have suffered a series of terrifying supernatural occurrences in the interim. Were the Lutz's brave, stupid, or simply after a lucrative book deal and a cut of the profits from the inevitable movie? You decide... The Amityville Horror, based on Jay Anson's best-selling account of the Lutz's ordeal, was one of the biggest horror hits of the 70s and has since spawned loads of sequels and a remake; it's an effectively creepy, well acted, and competently directed effort that succeeds in delivering a few scares and quite a bit of atmosphere, but it is also a rather frustrating affair, one that builds the tension to breaking point only to round things off with an anti-climactic ending that sees the Lutz family simply clearing out of the house, presumably in a hurry to get to the publishers and sign a deal for a sensational bestseller based on their experiences. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 purely for the scene where Margot Kidder does stretches.

    The American International production of "The Amityville Horror" is a decent enough horror flick that at the very least features one of the most distinctive and iconic residences, not just in horror cinema, but in real life. It sure makes for one Hell of a poster image. Many people by now are familiar with this notorious story, based on the incident of the alleged haunting of a Long Island house. A year after one of the residents shot the rest of his family to death, a new family moves in, including newlyweds George (played by James Brolin) and Kathy (played by Margot Kidder) and her three children from a previous marriage. Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies. A local priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger, who tears the scenery to pieces) becomes easily convinced that the house contains evil spirits and that the Lutz family is now in danger. Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.

    James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger star in director Stuart Rosenberg's 1979 thriller "The Amityville Horror", based on the alleged true story of the famed Amityville haunted house and the events that surrounded it. The film is a very well known haunted-house "classic", spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure but it didn't seem all that special to me. It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing becoming more violent. The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic "singing girls" theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force. The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems. I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be a bit boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

    For those of us who read Jay Anson's book before seeing the film, the success of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR rather depends on how much of the book you believe, a question I have been wrestling with since 1977 and to this day I have not been able to decide. There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show "In Search Of..."; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed: That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened. The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened. Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous. In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary. Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clich&eacute;s of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question: SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it. The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale. Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.

    Call me a sucker for the 70s New Hollywood style, but I really dig the aesthetic for this film. Tellingly, this was released in 1979, and by this point that aesthetic had trickled down to even lowest-common-denominator genre films... for the better, I would argue. The Amityville Horror, like The Exorcist before it, situates itself in the idyllic, almost rustic, family life that it will soon reveal as harbouring a deep violence. A slow pacing also benefits The Amityville Horror, showing the gradual transformation of Josh Brolin's George into a territorial madman. Ironically, this film was blasted as being mindless violence when it was first released, but now it seems more cerebral and deliberate than the bulk of popular movies today. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination -- the characters are two-dimensional and the acting doesn't help, and the conclusion in particular seems rushed. Other than the genuinely frightening bits with the flies, the movie is never able to really deliver the scares it hints at. To call this a horror classic is to perhaps do a disservice to the horror genre. But despite all this, it's not such a bad movie after all, and certainly deserves more than the initial round of condemnation. The Amityville Horror is a good evening of genre entertainment, providing a little to think on while the bodily thrills get to you, and that's all that we can really ask from a movie.

    Would you move into a house knowing full well that it had been the site of a gruesome shotgun massacre thirteen months earlier? No, me neither, but that's what the Lutz family did in the winter of '75, spending less than a month in their new home before fleeing the property, claiming to have suffered a series of terrifying supernatural occurrences in the interim. Were the Lutz's brave, stupid, or simply after a lucrative book deal and a cut of the profits from the inevitable movie? You decide... The Amityville Horror, based on Jay Anson's best-selling account of the Lutz's ordeal, was one of the biggest horror hits of the 70s and has since spawned loads of sequels and a remake; it's an effectively creepy, well acted, and competently directed effort that succeeds in delivering a few scares and quite a bit of atmosphere, but it is also a rather frustrating affair, one that builds the tension to breaking point only to round things off with an anti-climactic ending that sees the Lutz family simply clearing out of the house, presumably in a hurry to get to the publishers and sign a deal for a sensational bestseller based on their experiences. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 purely for the scene where Margot Kidder does stretches.

    The American International production of "The Amityville Horror" is a decent enough horror flick that at the very least features one of the most distinctive and iconic residences, not just in horror cinema, but in real life. It sure makes for one Hell of a poster image. Many people by now are familiar with this notorious story, based on the incident of the alleged haunting of a Long Island house. A year after one of the residents shot the rest of his family to death, a new family moves in, including newlyweds George (played by James Brolin) and Kathy (played by Margot Kidder) and her three children from a previous marriage. Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies. A local priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger, who tears the scenery to pieces) becomes easily convinced that the house contains evil spirits and that the Lutz family is now in danger. Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.

    James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger star in director Stuart Rosenberg's 1979 thriller "The Amityville Horror", based on the alleged true story of the famed Amityville haunted house and the events that surrounded it. The film is a very well known haunted-house "classic", spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure but it didn't seem all that special to me. It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing becoming more violent. The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic "singing girls" theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force. The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems. I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be a bit boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

    I just visited the actual house in Amityville, NY, and then I watched the original film. Terrible, but not totally unwatchable, film. Nothing "scary", just a lot of doors and windows bangin' shut, flies, sludge in toilets, the daughter has a (supposedly) imaginary evil friend, and a "red room" is discovered in the basement. Rather dull and much too long at 2+ hours. Of course the actors (James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger) totally emote. The most hilarious scene is of the braces-wearing, pony-tailed babysitter getting locked in a closet. The door slams shut behind her and she can't get out. So what does she do? She doesn't try to push the door open using her full body weight. Instead she pounds and knocks on the door over and over while sobbing. Oh yeah, THAT'S how you open a stuck door! FAKE. The movie was filmed in Toms River, NJ, *not* at the actual house in Amityville, NY. It's so obvious (to me) that the movie house isn't the real thing. The movie house's crescent-shaped windows are HUGE, the crescent-shaped windows face the water (river) in back of the house and not the street (as they did in real life), and the movie house's yard is much larger than the real life house's yard. FAKE. Plus in real life, the Lutz family lived in the house from mid-December 1975 until late January 1976. But in the film there is no snow, there is no Christmas tree in the house, and everyone is outside without coats on. FAKE. I think in real life the married couple concocted the "evilness" with the help of their priest. I wonder how the three individuals came into contact with the book's author and how much the three individuals were paid for their collaboration (conspiracy). I think the REAL story, if there is an actual "real" story, is that the married couple could not handle the psychological burden of knowing that they were living in a house where six murders took place only one year before they moved in. At first they were happy to buy the house at such a good (heavily discounted) price but slowly they came to grips with the eeriness of living in such an infamous place. I want to remake the film and focus the story on how the family (and priest) became more and more unhinged by this psychological burden and NOT by clich&eacute;d acts of the devil they supposedly witnessed.

    Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. In the movie, George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Their family priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that.

    This is one of the very few Horror Films that you may see people be bipolar around. Tons hate it, tons love it. Me? I didn't hate it, but I didn't care for it all. My main problem with Amityville Horror is that it's way too boring. It often moved like molasses for me. The house is creepy enough by itself, that it doesn't need a whole lot of other theatrics. But a consistent pace would have certainly helped matters. There is always suspension of disbelief when it comes to Horror movies, but I had trouble with a lot of the stuff that commenced in this movie. Why did the family take so long to stay in that house? I would have been gone at the first sign of trouble. Could Rod Steiger have been any more hammier as the priest? I dig intensity, but don't overact with it. It was embarrassing. The little subplot between the priests just didn't interest me. The good thing about this movie is the two leads. James Brolin is the reason I stuck with this movie as long as I did. That epic beard to go along with his creepily intense show was great stuff. The Brolin rocks! I've always dug Margot Kidder, despite her reputation. She played the caring wife to a T. Final Thoughts: Boring and overlong to boot. The only reason to see this is James Brolin's terrific performance. I would recommend the remake over this one. It's not great, but at least it's fairly entertaining. This is a mediocre film with very little entertainment or thrills 4/10

    Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away. This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one. The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything.

    This movie sticks fairly close to Jay Anson's novelized account of the Lutz family's ordeal at 112 Ocean Avenue. There are some slight changes, as noted in other reviews, to heighten dramatic effect; however, none as horribly disfigured as the 2005 remake, which completely obliterated the "known" facts about the incident. My problems with it, personally, are their choice of Margot Kidder to play Kathleen Lutz. I didn't even care for her performances in the Superman franchise. Just something about her rubs me the wrong way. Much of the incidents revealed in the novel were omitted from the movie mostly because it was a low-budget film, the last from MGM before they merged, and the money just wasn't there to make it into a high-grade spectacle that would do it justice. Still, stripped to the bare bones, it conveys the basic message of the story and, in my opinion, is the best of the entire Amityville franchise. My suggestion: read the book first!

The film is a very well known haunted-house "classic", spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure but it didn't seem all that special to me. It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing becoming more violent. The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic "singing girls" theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force. The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems. I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be a bit boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

    I just visited the actual house in Amityville, NY, and then I watched the original film. Terrible, but not totally unwatchable, film. Nothing "scary", just a lot of doors and windows bangin' shut, flies, sludge in toilets, the daughter has a (supposedly) imaginary evil friend, and a "red room" is discovered in the basement. Rather dull and much too long at 2+ hours. Of course the actors (James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger) totally emote. The most hilarious scene is of the braces-wearing, pony-tailed babysitter getting locked in a closet. The door slams shut behind her and she can't get out. So what does she do? She doesn't try to push the door open using her full body weight. Instead she pounds and knocks on the door over and over while sobbing. Oh yeah, THAT'S how you open a stuck door! FAKE. The movie was filmed in Toms River, NJ, *not* at the actual house in Amityville, NY. It's so obvious (to me) that the movie house isn't the real thing. The movie house's crescent-shaped windows are HUGE, the crescent-shaped windows face the water (river) in back of the house and not the street (as they did in real life), and the movie house's yard is much larger than the real life house's yard. FAKE. Plus in real life, the Lutz family lived in the house from mid-December 1975 until late January 1976. But in the film there is no snow, there is no Christmas tree in the house, and everyone is outside without coats on. FAKE. I think in real life the married couple concocted the "evilness" with the help of their priest. I wonder how the three individuals came into contact with the book's author and how much the three individuals were paid for their collaboration (conspiracy). I think the REAL story, if there is an actual "real" story, is that the married couple could not handle the psychological burden of knowing that they were living in a house where six murders took place only one year before they moved in. At first they were happy to buy the house at such a good (heavily discounted) price but slowly they came to grips with the eeriness of living in such an infamous place. I want to remake the film and focus the story on how the family (and priest) became more and more unhinged by this psychological burden and NOT by clich&eacute;d acts of the devil they supposedly witnessed.

    Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. In the movie, George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Their family priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that.

    This is one of the very few Horror Films that you may see people be bipolar around. Tons hate it, tons love it. Me? I didn't hate it, but I didn't care for it all. My main problem with Amityville Horror is that it's way too boring. It often moved like molasses for me. The house is creepy enough by itself, that it doesn't need a whole lot of other theatrics. But a consistent pace would have certainly helped matters. There is always suspension of disbelief when it comes to Horror movies, but I had trouble with a lot of the stuff that commenced in this movie. Why did the family take so long to stay in that house? I would have been gone at the first sign of trouble. Could Rod Steiger have been any more hammier as the priest? I dig intensity, but don't overact with it. It was embarrassing. The little subplot between the priests just didn't interest me. The good thing about this movie is the two leads. James Brolin is the reason I stuck with this movie as long as I did. That epic beard to go along with his creepily intense show was great stuff. The Brolin rocks! I've always dug Margot Kidder, despite her reputation. She played the caring wife to a T. Final Thoughts: Boring and overlong to boot. The only reason to see this is James Brolin's terrific performance. I would recommend the remake over this one. It's not great, but at least it's fairly entertaining. This is a mediocre film with very little entertainment or thrills 4/10

    Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away. This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one. The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything.

    This movie sticks fairly close to Jay Anson's novelized account of the Lutz family's ordeal at 112 Ocean Avenue. There are some slight changes, as noted in other reviews, to heighten dramatic effect; however, none as horribly disfigured as the 2005 remake, which completely obliterated the "known" facts about the incident. My problems with it, personally, are their choice of Margot Kidder to play Kathleen Lutz. I didn't even care for her performances in the Superman franchise. Just something about her rubs me the wrong way. Much of the incidents revealed in the novel were omitted from the movie mostly because it was a low-budget film, the last from MGM before they merged, and the money just wasn't there to make it into a high-grade spectacle that would do it justice. Still, stripped to the bare bones, it conveys the basic message of the story and, in my opinion, is the best of the entire Amityville franchise. My suggestion: read the book first!

    For those of us who read Jay Anson's book before seeing the film, the success of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR rather depends on how much of the book you believe, a question I have been wrestling with since 1977 and to this day I have not been able to decide. There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show "In Search Of..."; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed: That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened. The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened. Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous. In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary. Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clich&eacute;s of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question: SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it. The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale. Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.

    Call me a sucker for the 70s New Hollywood style, but I really dig the aesthetic for this film. Tellingly, this was released in 1979, and by this point that aesthetic had trickled down to even lowest-common-denominator genre films... for the better, I would argue. The Amityville Horror, like The Exorcist before it, situates itself in the idyllic, almost rustic, family life that it will soon reveal as harbouring a deep violence. A slow pacing also benefits The Amityville Horror, showing the gradual transformation of Josh Brolin's George into a territorial madman. Ironically, this film was blasted as being mindless violence when it was first released, but now it seems more cerebral and deliberate than the bulk of popular movies today. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination -- the characters are two-dimensional and the acting doesn't help, and the conclusion in particular seems rushed. Other than the genuinely frightening bits with the flies, the movie is never able to really deliver the scares it hints at. To call this a horror classic is to perhaps do a disservice to the horror genre. But despite all this, it's not such a bad movie after all, and certainly deserves more than the initial round of condemnation. The Amityville Horror is a good evening of genre entertainment, providing a little to think on while the bodily thrills get to you, and that's all that we can really ask from a movie.

    Would you move into a house knowing full well that it had been the site of a gruesome shotgun massacre thirteen months earlier? No, me neither, but that's what the Lutz family did in the winter of '75, spending less than a month in their new home before fleeing the property, claiming to have suffered a series of terrifying supernatural occurrences in the interim. Were the Lutz's brave, stupid, or simply after a lucrative book deal and a cut of the profits from the inevitable movie? You decide... The Amityville Horror, based on Jay Anson's best-selling account of the Lutz's ordeal, was one of the biggest horror hits of the 70s and has since spawned loads of sequels and a remake; it's an effectively creepy, well acted, and competently directed effort that succeeds in delivering a few scares and quite a bit of atmosphere, but it is also a rather frustrating affair, one that builds the tension to breaking point only to round things off with an anti-climactic ending that sees the Lutz family simply clearing out of the house, presumably in a hurry to get to the publishers and sign a deal for a sensational bestseller based on their experiences. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 purely for the scene where Margot Kidder does stretches.

    The American International production of "The Amityville Horror" is a decent enough horror flick that at the very least features one of the most distinctive and iconic residences, not just in horror cinema, but in real life. It sure makes for one Hell of a poster image. Many people by now are familiar with this notorious story, based on the incident of the alleged haunting of a Long Island house. A year after one of the residents shot the rest of his family to death, a new family moves in, including newlyweds George (played by James Brolin) and Kathy (played by Margot Kidder) and her three children from a previous marriage. Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies. A local priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger, who tears the scenery to pieces) becomes easily convinced that the house contains evil spirits and that the Lutz family is now in danger. Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.

    This movie sticks fairly close to Jay Anson's novelized account of the Lutz family's ordeal at 112 Ocean Avenue. There are some slight changes, as noted in other reviews, to heighten dramatic effect; however, none as horribly disfigured as the 2005 remake, which completely obliterated the "known" facts about the incident. My problems with it, personally, are their choice of Margot Kidder to play Kathleen Lutz. I didn't even care for her performances in the Superman franchise. Just something about her rubs me the wrong way. Much of the incidents revealed in the novel were omitted from the movie mostly because it was a low-budget film, the last from MGM before they merged, and the money just wasn't there to make it into a high-grade spectacle that would do it justice. Still, stripped to the bare bones, it conveys the basic message of the story and, in my opinion, is the best of the entire Amityville franchise. My suggestion: read the book first!

    For those of us who read Jay Anson's book before seeing the film, the success of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR rather depends on how much of the book you believe, a question I have been wrestling with since 1977 and to this day I have not been able to decide. There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show "In Search Of..."; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed: That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened. The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened. Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous. In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary. Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clich&eacute;s of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question: SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it. The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale. Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.

    Call me a sucker for the 70s New Hollywood style, but I really dig the aesthetic for this film. Tellingly, this was released in 1979, and by this point that aesthetic had trickled down to even lowest-common-denominator genre films... for the better, I would argue. The Amityville Horror, like The Exorcist before it, situates itself in the idyllic, almost rustic, family life that it will soon reveal as harbouring a deep violence. A slow pacing also benefits The Amityville Horror, showing the gradual transformation of Josh Brolin's George into a territorial madman. Ironically, this film was blasted as being mindless violence when it was first released, but now it seems more cerebral and deliberate than the bulk of popular movies today. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination -- the characters are two-dimensional and the acting doesn't help, and the conclusion in particular seems rushed. Other than the genuinely frightening bits with the flies, the movie is never able to really deliver the scares it hints at. To call this a horror classic is to perhaps do a disservice to the horror genre. But despite all this, it's not such a bad movie after all, and certainly deserves more than the initial round of condemnation. The Amityville Horror is a good evening of genre entertainment, providing a little to think on while the bodily thrills get to you, and that's all that we can really ask from a movie.

    Would you move into a house knowing full well that it had been the site of a gruesome shotgun massacre thirteen months earlier? No, me neither, but that's what the Lutz family did in the winter of '75, spending less than a month in their new home before fleeing the property, claiming to have suffered a series of terrifying supernatural occurrences in the interim. Were the Lutz's brave, stupid, or simply after a lucrative book deal and a cut of the profits from the inevitable movie? You decide... The Amityville Horror, based on Jay Anson's best-selling account of the Lutz's ordeal, was one of the biggest horror hits of the 70s and has since spawned loads of sequels and a remake; it's an effectively creepy, well acted, and competently directed effort that succeeds in delivering a few scares and quite a bit of atmosphere, but it is also a rather frustrating affair, one that builds the tension to breaking point only to round things off with an anti-climactic ending that sees the Lutz family simply clearing out of the house, presumably in a hurry to get to the publishers and sign a deal for a sensational bestseller based on their experiences. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 purely for the scene where Margot Kidder does stretches.

    The American International production of "The Amityville Horror" is a decent enough horror flick that at the very least features one of the most distinctive and iconic residences, not just in horror cinema, but in real life. It sure makes for one Hell of a poster image. Many people by now are familiar with this notorious story, based on the incident of the alleged haunting of a Long Island house. A year after one of the residents shot the rest of his family to death, a new family moves in, including newlyweds George (played by James Brolin) and Kathy (played by Margot Kidder) and her three children from a previous marriage. Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies. A local priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger, who tears the scenery to pieces) becomes easily convinced that the house contains evil spirits and that the Lutz family is now in danger. Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.

    James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger star in director Stuart Rosenberg's 1979 thriller "The Amityville Horror", based on the alleged true story of the famed Amityville haunted house and the events that surrounded it. The film is a very well known haunted-house "classic", spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure but it didn't seem all that special to me. It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing becoming more violent. The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic "singing girls" theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force. The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems. I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be a bit boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

    I just visited the actual house in Amityville, NY, and then I watched the original film. Terrible, but not totally unwatchable, film. Nothing "scary", just a lot of doors and windows bangin' shut, flies, sludge in toilets, the daughter has a (supposedly) imaginary evil friend, and a "red room" is discovered in the basement. Rather dull and much too long at 2+ hours. Of course the actors (James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger) totally emote. The most hilarious scene is of the braces-wearing, pony-tailed babysitter getting locked in a closet. The door slams shut behind her and she can't get out. So what does she do? She doesn't try to push the door open using her full body weight. Instead she pounds and knocks on the door over and over while sobbing. Oh yeah, THAT'S how you open a stuck door! FAKE. The movie was filmed in Toms River, NJ, *not* at the actual house in Amityville, NY. It's so obvious (to me) that the movie house isn't the real thing. The movie house's crescent-shaped windows are HUGE, the crescent-shaped windows face the water (river) in back of the house and not the street (as they did in real life), and the movie house's yard is much larger than the real life house's yard. FAKE. Plus in real life, the Lutz family lived in the house from mid-December 1975 until late January 1976. But in the film there is no snow, there is no Christmas tree in the house, and everyone is outside without coats on. FAKE. I think in real life the married couple concocted the "evilness" with the help of their priest. I wonder how the three individuals came into contact with the book's author and how much the three individuals were paid for their collaboration (conspiracy). I think the REAL story, if there is an actual "real" story, is that the married couple could not handle the psychological burden of knowing that they were living in a house where six murders took place only one year before they moved in. At first they were happy to buy the house at such a good (heavily discounted) price but slowly they came to grips with the eeriness of living in such an infamous place. I want to remake the film and focus the story on how the family (and priest) became more and more unhinged by this psychological burden and NOT by clich&eacute;d acts of the devil they supposedly witnessed.

    Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. In the movie, George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Their family priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that.

    This is one of the very few Horror Films that you may see people be bipolar around. Tons hate it, tons love it. Me? I didn't hate it, but I didn't care for it all. My main problem with Amityville Horror is that it's way too boring. It often moved like molasses for me. The house is creepy enough by itself, that it doesn't need a whole lot of other theatrics. But a consistent pace would have certainly helped matters. There is always suspension of disbelief when it comes to Horror movies, but I had trouble with a lot of the stuff that commenced in this movie. Why did the family take so long to stay in that house? I would have been gone at the first sign of trouble. Could Rod Steiger have been any more hammier as the priest? I dig intensity, but don't overact with it. It was embarrassing. The little subplot between the priests just didn't interest me. The good thing about this movie is the two leads. James Brolin is the reason I stuck with this movie as long as I did. That epic beard to go along with his creepily intense show was great stuff. The Brolin rocks! I've always dug Margot Kidder, despite her reputation. She played the caring wife to a T. Final Thoughts: Boring and overlong to boot. The only reason to see this is James Brolin's terrific performance. I would recommend the remake over this one. It's not great, but at least it's fairly entertaining. This is a mediocre film with very little entertainment or thrills 4/10

    Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away. This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one. The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything.

Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies.

Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.

    James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger star in director Stuart Rosenberg's 1979 thriller "The Amityville Horror", based on the alleged true story of the famed Amityville haunted house and the events that surrounded it. The film is a very well known haunted-house "classic", spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure but it didn't seem all that special to me. It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing becoming more violent. The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic "singing girls" theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force. The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems. I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be a bit boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

    I just visited the actual house in Amityville, NY, and then I watched the original film. Terrible, but not totally unwatchable, film. Nothing "scary", just a lot of doors and windows bangin' shut, flies, sludge in toilets, the daughter has a (supposedly) imaginary evil friend, and a "red room" is discovered in the basement. Rather dull and much too long at 2+ hours. Of course the actors (James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger) totally emote. The most hilarious scene is of the braces-wearing, pony-tailed babysitter getting locked in a closet. The door slams shut behind her and she can't get out. So what does she do? She doesn't try to push the door open using her full body weight. Instead she pounds and knocks on the door over and over while sobbing. Oh yeah, THAT'S how you open a stuck door! FAKE. The movie was filmed in Toms River, NJ, *not* at the actual house in Amityville, NY. It's so obvious (to me) that the movie house isn't the real thing. The movie house's crescent-shaped windows are HUGE, the crescent-shaped windows face the water (river) in back of the house and not the street (as they did in real life), and the movie house's yard is much larger than the real life house's yard. FAKE. Plus in real life, the Lutz family lived in the house from mid-December 1975 until late January 1976. But in the film there is no snow, there is no Christmas tree in the house, and everyone is outside without coats on. FAKE. I think in real life the married couple concocted the "evilness" with the help of their priest. I wonder how the three individuals came into contact with the book's author and how much the three individuals were paid for their collaboration (conspiracy). I think the REAL story, if there is an actual "real" story, is that the married couple could not handle the psychological burden of knowing that they were living in a house where six murders took place only one year before they moved in. At first they were happy to buy the house at such a good (heavily discounted) price but slowly they came to grips with the eeriness of living in such an infamous place. I want to remake the film and focus the story on how the family (and priest) became more and more unhinged by this psychological burden and NOT by clich&eacute;d acts of the devil they supposedly witnessed.

    Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. In the movie, George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Their family priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that.

    This is one of the very few Horror Films that you may see people be bipolar around. Tons hate it, tons love it. Me? I didn't hate it, but I didn't care for it all. My main problem with Amityville Horror is that it's way too boring. It often moved like molasses for me. The house is creepy enough by itself, that it doesn't need a whole lot of other theatrics. But a consistent pace would have certainly helped matters. There is always suspension of disbelief when it comes to Horror movies, but I had trouble with a lot of the stuff that commenced in this movie. Why did the family take so long to stay in that house? I would have been gone at the first sign of trouble. Could Rod Steiger have been any more hammier as the priest? I dig intensity, but don't overact with it. It was embarrassing. The little subplot between the priests just didn't interest me. The good thing about this movie is the two leads. James Brolin is the reason I stuck with this movie as long as I did. That epic beard to go along with his creepily intense show was great stuff. The Brolin rocks! I've always dug Margot Kidder, despite her reputation. She played the caring wife to a T. Final Thoughts: Boring and overlong to boot. The only reason to see this is James Brolin's terrific performance. I would recommend the remake over this one. It's not great, but at least it's fairly entertaining. This is a mediocre film with very little entertainment or thrills 4/10

    Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away. This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one. The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything.

    This movie sticks fairly close to Jay Anson's novelized account of the Lutz family's ordeal at 112 Ocean Avenue. There are some slight changes, as noted in other reviews, to heighten dramatic effect; however, none as horribly disfigured as the 2005 remake, which completely obliterated the "known" facts about the incident. My problems with it, personally, are their choice of Margot Kidder to play Kathleen Lutz. I didn't even care for her performances in the Superman franchise. Just something about her rubs me the wrong way. Much of the incidents revealed in the novel were omitted from the movie mostly because it was a low-budget film, the last from MGM before they merged, and the money just wasn't there to make it into a high-grade spectacle that would do it justice. Still, stripped to the bare bones, it conveys the basic message of the story and, in my opinion, is the best of the entire Amityville franchise. My suggestion: read the book first!

    For those of us who read Jay Anson's book before seeing the film, the success of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR rather depends on how much of the book you believe, a question I have been wrestling with since 1977 and to this day I have not been able to decide. There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show "In Search Of..."; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed: That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened. The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened. Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous. In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary. Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clich&eacute;s of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question: SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it. The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale. Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.

    Call me a sucker for the 70s New Hollywood style, but I really dig the aesthetic for this film. Tellingly, this was released in 1979, and by this point that aesthetic had trickled down to even lowest-common-denominator genre films... for the better, I would argue. The Amityville Horror, like The Exorcist before it, situates itself in the idyllic, almost rustic, family life that it will soon reveal as harbouring a deep violence. A slow pacing also benefits The Amityville Horror, showing the gradual transformation of Josh Brolin's George into a territorial madman. Ironically, this film was blasted as being mindless violence when it was first released, but now it seems more cerebral and deliberate than the bulk of popular movies today. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination -- the characters are two-dimensional and the acting doesn't help, and the conclusion in particular seems rushed. Other than the genuinely frightening bits with the flies, the movie is never able to really deliver the scares it hints at. To call this a horror classic is to perhaps do a disservice to the horror genre. But despite all this, it's not such a bad movie after all, and certainly deserves more than the initial round of condemnation. The Amityville Horror is a good evening of genre entertainment, providing a little to think on while the bodily thrills get to you, and that's all that we can really ask from a movie.

    Would you move into a house knowing full well that it had been the site of a gruesome shotgun massacre thirteen months earlier? No, me neither, but that's what the Lutz family did in the winter of '75, spending less than a month in their new home before fleeing the property, claiming to have suffered a series of terrifying supernatural occurrences in the interim. Were the Lutz's brave, stupid, or simply after a lucrative book deal and a cut of the profits from the inevitable movie? You decide... The Amityville Horror, based on Jay Anson's best-selling account of the Lutz's ordeal, was one of the biggest horror hits of the 70s and has since spawned loads of sequels and a remake; it's an effectively creepy, well acted, and competently directed effort that succeeds in delivering a few scares and quite a bit of atmosphere, but it is also a rather frustrating affair, one that builds the tension to breaking point only to round things off with an anti-climactic ending that sees the Lutz family simply clearing out of the house, presumably in a hurry to get to the publishers and sign a deal for a sensational bestseller based on their experiences. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 purely for the scene where Margot Kidder does stretches.

    The American International production of "The Amityville Horror" is a decent enough horror flick that at the very least features one of the most distinctive and iconic residences, not just in horror cinema, but in real life. It sure makes for one Hell of a poster image. Many people by now are familiar with this notorious story, based on the incident of the alleged haunting of a Long Island house. A year after one of the residents shot the rest of his family to death, a new family moves in, including newlyweds George (played by James Brolin) and Kathy (played by Margot Kidder) and her three children from a previous marriage. Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies. A local priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger, who tears the scenery to pieces) becomes easily convinced that the house contains evil spirits and that the Lutz family is now in danger. Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.
