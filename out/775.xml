    I know Callie Khouri thinks she's this huge feminist, but as one, I'm always mystified as to how she arrived at that conclusion. I've never seen Thelma and Louise, but I do watch Nashville (though it's already lather, rinse, repeat and the first season isn't even over!) and I've also seen Divine Secrets (also, just god awful). All three vehicles have verrrry similar elements and a lot of elements seem more like the plot lines of a 1950's pot boiler, not something reasonably modern (and I was turning 30 in 1995, so yeah, I "get" the time frame of this film). Each one features a whiny, spoilt, Southern (usually) Daddy's girl who remains in whatever small community she and her family are near royalty in. Despite the fact that she either hates it there or is at least deeply frustrated by it. This, of course, shows how "sensitive" our heroine is (actually it shows that she can't poop or get off the pot). She also generally is only able to TRULY love her high school sweetheart (weird since Khouri is on her second marriage, to someone she didn't meet until late in life). She also has deep regrets about not being able to achieve her girlhood dreams, even though it's typically something with relatively few obstacles, fairly modest and well, sometimes just life for us mere mortals. In the film Julia/Grace wanted to be a large animal vet and didn't have that much school left to achieve this. She dropped out because she was pregnant and had to get married. But unlike the typical Southern woman, who would now sadly toil at Walmart or Piggly-Wiggly, Julia works for Daddy, managing his fancy stables. Although she "doesn't have time" to return to school (even though somehow I suspect Daddy might be a fairly flexible employer in the scheduling department), she does have time to be an active Junior League Member. Not to mention, she's still able to work around large animals and care for them. She just isn't a vet. Really, very little happens other than everyone chewing scenery and infidelity coming out all over the place. In the end, Julia goes back to Vet school (how she's now able to do this on one income, and move into her own pad with her daughter is never explained, I'll just guess, Daddy). She also takes back pathologically serial cheater Dennis Quaid. Why? Basically cause they dance sexy to Bonnie Raitt in front of everyone (even though a way nicer, cuter dude wants her, but he, of course isn't her high school twu wuv) and he fixes her a nice dinner. Yeah, that's some serious lady empowerment, there!!! Just be pretty, have a rich daddy and ultimately forgive that loser and your life will go from crap to awesome!!!

    This is a FANTASTIC movie in my opinion. This is just a great movie with lots of great one liners and comedy situations that are highly original and just plain fun. I think a lot of people that review movies on here seem to forget that they are made for "entertainment" - it really doesn't matter how realistic or technically correct they are. If you are a someone highly critical of specifics in a movie, you probably wont enjoy this. However, if you are someone who can view it as a movie, and not be overly critical - this is a wonderfully fun time. This is one of Julia Roberts best roles. A truly flustered, very busy mom, that has too much on her plate to deal with everything. But, she seems to handle it anyway.

    Pretentious and a huge waste of talent. Julia Roberts is a great actress and has a fantastic smile – a smile so un-really radiant that it becomes unreal pretty soon. That’s the risk she runs. And so does the movie. Dialogues for the single sister are good while the movie is quite pretentious and a drag at times. Dennis Quaid is fantastic. The story borders on the most idiotic generalization – southern men think with their southern asset and the women don’t have brains at all. Pretty idiotic fare. Gene Rowlands mom lacks depth and looks like she is on prescriptive medication - she takes a 180 degree turn in the middle of the movie. And Duvall's character is so foolish it hurts. The only saving grace is the dance sequence - but then I can bet there have been infinitely better results than this.

    When it comes to directors like Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, I always expect maximum, best, masterpiece. After movies that he made back in Finland and brilliant "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" I think that my expectations were justified. Sadly, this movie came just behind Gilbert so I can live with one mediocre movie after a huge success with Gilbert and then later movie like "The Cider House Rules", "Chocolat"... Hallstr&ouml;m likes to make family movies, where he can expose the whole family with all their pluses and minuses. In this case, story was written by Callie Khouri (Thelma & Louise), typical 'women are always good' writer. In the middle of the story we've got Grace Bichon (Julia Roberts), who founds out that her husband Eddie (Dennis Quaid) is unfaithful. With her daughter, she decides to come back home at ranch. There she must face her traditional father Wyly (Robert Duvall) and mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands), who seems to be doing whatever Wyly wants. The only person who fully understands her is her sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick). I disagree that there is nothing to talk about in this movie. Yes, this movie has some obvious problems: the script is not brilliant which is mostly seen in situations that we've all seen before and characters like Eddie, Wyly and Georgia are written on a way that there is nothing for actors to act. But all Hallstr&ouml;m characters are alive (you can identify with them) and about family problems that are presented in this movie there is plenty to talk about. For example, what strong woman like Grace does when she's cheated, how to explain her young daughter that her dad isn't living with them any more; the whole relationship of Bichon's after infidelity. On the other hand, we've got relationship between two sisters, between Wyly and Georgia King and so on. So we've got plenty stuff to talk about only if you think about it for a while. What this script lacks is quality writing of male characters. Duvall's and Quaid's characters are simply not developed enough. About acting part, I must admit that Julia Roberts is very good in this role, just like Kyra Sedgwick and Brett Cullen (his character is the only male character that is made right). Duvall, Rowlands & Quaid have nothing to act, like I said before. But I read one comment that says that Duvall shouldn't act in any movie. That is what made me angry so I had to write it. Man is a screen and stage legend! So to end, if you can watch this family drama about marriage, infidelity and love. It's not the best choice coming from Hallstr&ouml;m but it's a bearable one.

    Enjoyed the great comic acting by Julia Roberts as (Grace King Bichon) who had plenty of family problems with children, grandparents, mother-in-laws and friends. Dennis Quaid,(Eddie Bichon) gives a supporting role as the husband, but I just could not find him suited for this role and especially opposite a great star like Julie Roberts. Quaid just simply did not fit into this role, of course, that is my opinion. Robert Duval,(Wyly King) who was very funny with his southern accent and great supporting role along with Gene Rowlands, (Georgia King) who gets tired of her husband and locks poor old Wyly outside of their huge home. One of Grace King's family members suggests she make a new dish of food for her husband and that is when things get turned all around. A bit Way Out, someone could be put in jail.

    Good movie about gracious southern life mixed with a lot of behavior that is anything but gracious. The movie couldn't seem to decide between being a drama and a comedy, but is nevertheless more than worth watching because of the character played by Kyra Sedgwick. She has at least 2 or 3 of the greatest lines ever uttered in the movies that will make you absolutely fall out with laughter (unless they offend your delicate sensibilities too much). I loved this movie. It shouldn't be taken as seriously as some seem to want to take it. The title indicates to me that they were really aiming at comedy here, and it some places, they really, really hit it.

    Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema. The story is rather slight: Grace (Julia Roberts) is a Southern Belle horse trainer married to handsome but womanizing Eddie (Dennis Quaid) who discovers to her amazement that Eddie is dating other women. This throws Grace into a rage that affects her family, her family's typical Southern response to appearances, and ultimately awakens not only Grace but also every member of her family to secrets that allow them to take charge of their prettified hollow lives! Grace's sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick, in yet another of her sensational roles) is a perky, spitfire of a woman who seems to be the only member who has her act together; her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and father Wyly (Robert Duvall) are both able to reveal the old South and the new individuality they achieve; Brett Cullen, Haley Aull, and Muse Watson are all excellent in their roles. One of the most entertaining aspects of this entertaining film is the confrontation between 'old manners' and new reality - with some heady lessons for all of us to observe and allow chuckles. It is a tight little film that deserves another visit on DVD.

    There are some films that move you. There are some films that make you laugh. There are some films that make you cry. And then there are some films, that mislead you with the tagline, cover of the film and in some cases the preview. This is one such film. After waiting eleven years to finally see this movie, I wondered why I had anticipated it so much. What a let down this film was. I was expecting some cute, romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Denis Quaid, who would argue, and make-up every other scene, and share equal screen time. Wow, was I wrong. No wonder Quaid's name came last on the credits at the beginning of the film. He's hardly worth mentioning. The film is circled more or less on a horse ranch that Grace (Roberts) works on, which is owned by her rich father. She finds her husband (Quaid) one afternoon, cheating on her, and the whole movie is dedicated to her being angry with him, and refusing to forgive him for having cheated on her. However, the reason the tag lines and previews are misleading, is because the movie is more focused on the horse ranch, rather than on her personal situation. I found the movie quite frankly boring, and really of not much interest. Kyra Sedgwick was excellent, and I think I liked her the most out of everyone in the film. I'm not a Robert Duvall fan, so don't ask me what I thought of him, I don't know why he gets casted for any parts, in any films. Gena Rowlands was good as usual...and well what can you say about the sexy and terrific Denis Quaid? He was his usual charming self, and how could you blame anyone for liking him? Julia Roberts, was certainly not at her best, but then better than her non-deserving Oscar award winning performance in "Erin Brockovich." The movie was flat, and lacked so much that it had potential for. I highly not recommend this film, and suggest you check something more along the lines of "Notting Hill" or "Pretty Woman" if you're looking for a good Roberts flick. And if it's Quaid you're interested in, go with, "Innerspace" or "In Good Company". You won't go wrong with any of those, however this one will let you down right from the beginning, and the end won't do you much good either. Because that was not you're typical ending to a film like this. Good luck with it...you're going to need it.

    As a resident the Carolina Coast, one sees the appellation "Lowcountry" on many things including a goodly number of businesses and other entities both public and private. As a descriptor, it is both ubiquitous and quite accurate. Thus , my wife and I were quite surprised to see "Lowcountry Locksmith" on a vehicle in a film that was set in the Kentucky Horse country. I try to catch incongruities and goofs in films as hobby, but my wife spotted this particular one. Knowing that a good portion of this film was shot in the Beaufort, South Carolina area, we enjoyed a quick laugh during that scene.

    This movie had all the essential elements at hand, but somehow it doesn't come together. The main reason is the poor direction by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m. He has done solid movies before, I'm a big fan of Chocolat, but unfortunately he comes off as an amateur here. The viewer never gets a feel for the "geography" of the setting. Important little interactions are barely visible -- for example, when Jamie offers Grace another drink, and she grabs his, it is a potentially comical and telling moment that isn't even on screen. (I couldn't figure it out until watching carefully during the second viewing -- did she grab the bottle? did she take her empty glass? Eventually it appears she has a glass in hand with liquor still in it.) The little girl's acting seemed to be left to chance, and chance didn't do a good job for her. There is frequently a lack of realistic presentation in the sequence of action. One minute Eddie can't breathe after being kicked in the balls, 10 seconds later he is walking normally into the kitchen. The potentially hilarious scene at the women's "cookbook" meeting, when Grace demands to know who else has slept with her husband, was almost ruined by Hallstrom's failure to coordinate line-response. The audience gasps before Grace finishes speaking the essential words in her question. In fact, that whole scene, with its unrealistic, one-dimensional characters, ultimately comes across as condescending toward women. Another fundamental problem with this movie is the plot. Callie Khouri is nothing less than a brilliant screenwriter, but I think she handicapped herself here with post-T and L fears of accusations of "man-hating". Understandable, given the public platform given to all the scary men loudly objecting to the depiction of a woman shooting a rapist ["dear God!"] Callie Khouri's strength is her honest, cut-the-gloss depictions of painful male-female relationships, along with the comedy she brings forth through allowing women an instinctual response to abuse. In this script, however, those moments of comedic and tragic honesty are kept in cages, so that there are little gems scattered throughout, but the movie as a whole does not reflect her native talents.

Grace's sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick, in yet another of her sensational roles) is a perky, spitfire of a woman who seems to be the only member who has her act together; her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and father Wyly (Robert Duvall) are both able to reveal the old South and the new individuality they achieve; Brett Cullen, Haley Aull, and Muse Watson are all excellent in their roles. One of the most entertaining aspects of this entertaining film is the confrontation between 'old manners' and new reality - with some heady lessons for all of us to observe and allow chuckles. It is a tight little film that deserves another visit on DVD.

    There are some films that move you. There are some films that make you laugh. There are some films that make you cry. And then there are some films, that mislead you with the tagline, cover of the film and in some cases the preview. This is one such film. After waiting eleven years to finally see this movie, I wondered why I had anticipated it so much. What a let down this film was. I was expecting some cute, romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Denis Quaid, who would argue, and make-up every other scene, and share equal screen time. Wow, was I wrong. No wonder Quaid's name came last on the credits at the beginning of the film. He's hardly worth mentioning. The film is circled more or less on a horse ranch that Grace (Roberts) works on, which is owned by her rich father. She finds her husband (Quaid) one afternoon, cheating on her, and the whole movie is dedicated to her being angry with him, and refusing to forgive him for having cheated on her. However, the reason the tag lines and previews are misleading, is because the movie is more focused on the horse ranch, rather than on her personal situation. I found the movie quite frankly boring, and really of not much interest. Kyra Sedgwick was excellent, and I think I liked her the most out of everyone in the film. I'm not a Robert Duvall fan, so don't ask me what I thought of him, I don't know why he gets casted for any parts, in any films. Gena Rowlands was good as usual...and well what can you say about the sexy and terrific Denis Quaid? He was his usual charming self, and how could you blame anyone for liking him? Julia Roberts, was certainly not at her best, but then better than her non-deserving Oscar award winning performance in "Erin Brockovich." The movie was flat, and lacked so much that it had potential for. I highly not recommend this film, and suggest you check something more along the lines of "Notting Hill" or "Pretty Woman" if you're looking for a good Roberts flick. And if it's Quaid you're interested in, go with, "Innerspace" or "In Good Company". You won't go wrong with any of those, however this one will let you down right from the beginning, and the end won't do you much good either. Because that was not you're typical ending to a film like this. Good luck with it...you're going to need it.

    As a resident the Carolina Coast, one sees the appellation "Lowcountry" on many things including a goodly number of businesses and other entities both public and private. As a descriptor, it is both ubiquitous and quite accurate. Thus , my wife and I were quite surprised to see "Lowcountry Locksmith" on a vehicle in a film that was set in the Kentucky Horse country. I try to catch incongruities and goofs in films as hobby, but my wife spotted this particular one. Knowing that a good portion of this film was shot in the Beaufort, South Carolina area, we enjoyed a quick laugh during that scene.

    This movie had all the essential elements at hand, but somehow it doesn't come together. The main reason is the poor direction by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m. He has done solid movies before, I'm a big fan of Chocolat, but unfortunately he comes off as an amateur here. The viewer never gets a feel for the "geography" of the setting. Important little interactions are barely visible -- for example, when Jamie offers Grace another drink, and she grabs his, it is a potentially comical and telling moment that isn't even on screen. (I couldn't figure it out until watching carefully during the second viewing -- did she grab the bottle? did she take her empty glass? Eventually it appears she has a glass in hand with liquor still in it.) The little girl's acting seemed to be left to chance, and chance didn't do a good job for her. There is frequently a lack of realistic presentation in the sequence of action. One minute Eddie can't breathe after being kicked in the balls, 10 seconds later he is walking normally into the kitchen. The potentially hilarious scene at the women's "cookbook" meeting, when Grace demands to know who else has slept with her husband, was almost ruined by Hallstrom's failure to coordinate line-response. The audience gasps before Grace finishes speaking the essential words in her question. In fact, that whole scene, with its unrealistic, one-dimensional characters, ultimately comes across as condescending toward women. Another fundamental problem with this movie is the plot. Callie Khouri is nothing less than a brilliant screenwriter, but I think she handicapped herself here with post-T and L fears of accusations of "man-hating". Understandable, given the public platform given to all the scary men loudly objecting to the depiction of a woman shooting a rapist ["dear God!"] Callie Khouri's strength is her honest, cut-the-gloss depictions of painful male-female relationships, along with the comedy she brings forth through allowing women an instinctual response to abuse. In this script, however, those moments of comedic and tragic honesty are kept in cages, so that there are little gems scattered throughout, but the movie as a whole does not reflect her native talents.

    I know Callie Khouri thinks she's this huge feminist, but as one, I'm always mystified as to how she arrived at that conclusion. I've never seen Thelma and Louise, but I do watch Nashville (though it's already lather, rinse, repeat and the first season isn't even over!) and I've also seen Divine Secrets (also, just god awful). All three vehicles have verrrry similar elements and a lot of elements seem more like the plot lines of a 1950's pot boiler, not something reasonably modern (and I was turning 30 in 1995, so yeah, I "get" the time frame of this film). Each one features a whiny, spoilt, Southern (usually) Daddy's girl who remains in whatever small community she and her family are near royalty in. Despite the fact that she either hates it there or is at least deeply frustrated by it. This, of course, shows how "sensitive" our heroine is (actually it shows that she can't poop or get off the pot). She also generally is only able to TRULY love her high school sweetheart (weird since Khouri is on her second marriage, to someone she didn't meet until late in life). She also has deep regrets about not being able to achieve her girlhood dreams, even though it's typically something with relatively few obstacles, fairly modest and well, sometimes just life for us mere mortals. In the film Julia/Grace wanted to be a large animal vet and didn't have that much school left to achieve this. She dropped out because she was pregnant and had to get married. But unlike the typical Southern woman, who would now sadly toil at Walmart or Piggly-Wiggly, Julia works for Daddy, managing his fancy stables. Although she "doesn't have time" to return to school (even though somehow I suspect Daddy might be a fairly flexible employer in the scheduling department), she does have time to be an active Junior League Member. Not to mention, she's still able to work around large animals and care for them. She just isn't a vet. Really, very little happens other than everyone chewing scenery and infidelity coming out all over the place. In the end, Julia goes back to Vet school (how she's now able to do this on one income, and move into her own pad with her daughter is never explained, I'll just guess, Daddy). She also takes back pathologically serial cheater Dennis Quaid. Why? Basically cause they dance sexy to Bonnie Raitt in front of everyone (even though a way nicer, cuter dude wants her, but he, of course isn't her high school twu wuv) and he fixes her a nice dinner. Yeah, that's some serious lady empowerment, there!!! Just be pretty, have a rich daddy and ultimately forgive that loser and your life will go from crap to awesome!!!

    This is a FANTASTIC movie in my opinion. This is just a great movie with lots of great one liners and comedy situations that are highly original and just plain fun. I think a lot of people that review movies on here seem to forget that they are made for "entertainment" - it really doesn't matter how realistic or technically correct they are. If you are a someone highly critical of specifics in a movie, you probably wont enjoy this. However, if you are someone who can view it as a movie, and not be overly critical - this is a wonderfully fun time. This is one of Julia Roberts best roles. A truly flustered, very busy mom, that has too much on her plate to deal with everything. But, she seems to handle it anyway.

    Pretentious and a huge waste of talent. Julia Roberts is a great actress and has a fantastic smile – a smile so un-really radiant that it becomes unreal pretty soon. That’s the risk she runs. And so does the movie. Dialogues for the single sister are good while the movie is quite pretentious and a drag at times. Dennis Quaid is fantastic. The story borders on the most idiotic generalization – southern men think with their southern asset and the women don’t have brains at all. Pretty idiotic fare. Gene Rowlands mom lacks depth and looks like she is on prescriptive medication - she takes a 180 degree turn in the middle of the movie. And Duvall's character is so foolish it hurts. The only saving grace is the dance sequence - but then I can bet there have been infinitely better results than this.

    When it comes to directors like Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, I always expect maximum, best, masterpiece. After movies that he made back in Finland and brilliant "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" I think that my expectations were justified. Sadly, this movie came just behind Gilbert so I can live with one mediocre movie after a huge success with Gilbert and then later movie like "The Cider House Rules", "Chocolat"... Hallstr&ouml;m likes to make family movies, where he can expose the whole family with all their pluses and minuses. In this case, story was written by Callie Khouri (Thelma & Louise), typical 'women are always good' writer. In the middle of the story we've got Grace Bichon (Julia Roberts), who founds out that her husband Eddie (Dennis Quaid) is unfaithful. With her daughter, she decides to come back home at ranch. There she must face her traditional father Wyly (Robert Duvall) and mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands), who seems to be doing whatever Wyly wants. The only person who fully understands her is her sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick). I disagree that there is nothing to talk about in this movie. Yes, this movie has some obvious problems: the script is not brilliant which is mostly seen in situations that we've all seen before and characters like Eddie, Wyly and Georgia are written on a way that there is nothing for actors to act. But all Hallstr&ouml;m characters are alive (you can identify with them) and about family problems that are presented in this movie there is plenty to talk about. For example, what strong woman like Grace does when she's cheated, how to explain her young daughter that her dad isn't living with them any more; the whole relationship of Bichon's after infidelity. On the other hand, we've got relationship between two sisters, between Wyly and Georgia King and so on. So we've got plenty stuff to talk about only if you think about it for a while. What this script lacks is quality writing of male characters. Duvall's and Quaid's characters are simply not developed enough. About acting part, I must admit that Julia Roberts is very good in this role, just like Kyra Sedgwick and Brett Cullen (his character is the only male character that is made right). Duvall, Rowlands & Quaid have nothing to act, like I said before. But I read one comment that says that Duvall shouldn't act in any movie. That is what made me angry so I had to write it. Man is a screen and stage legend! So to end, if you can watch this family drama about marriage, infidelity and love. It's not the best choice coming from Hallstr&ouml;m but it's a bearable one.

    Enjoyed the great comic acting by Julia Roberts as (Grace King Bichon) who had plenty of family problems with children, grandparents, mother-in-laws and friends. Dennis Quaid,(Eddie Bichon) gives a supporting role as the husband, but I just could not find him suited for this role and especially opposite a great star like Julie Roberts. Quaid just simply did not fit into this role, of course, that is my opinion. Robert Duval,(Wyly King) who was very funny with his southern accent and great supporting role along with Gene Rowlands, (Georgia King) who gets tired of her husband and locks poor old Wyly outside of their huge home. One of Grace King's family members suggests she make a new dish of food for her husband and that is when things get turned all around. A bit Way Out, someone could be put in jail.

    Good movie about gracious southern life mixed with a lot of behavior that is anything but gracious. The movie couldn't seem to decide between being a drama and a comedy, but is nevertheless more than worth watching because of the character played by Kyra Sedgwick. She has at least 2 or 3 of the greatest lines ever uttered in the movies that will make you absolutely fall out with laughter (unless they offend your delicate sensibilities too much). I loved this movie. It shouldn't be taken as seriously as some seem to want to take it. The title indicates to me that they were really aiming at comedy here, and it some places, they really, really hit it.

    Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema. The story is rather slight: Grace (Julia Roberts) is a Southern Belle horse trainer married to handsome but womanizing Eddie (Dennis Quaid) who discovers to her amazement that Eddie is dating other women. This throws Grace into a rage that affects her family, her family's typical Southern response to appearances, and ultimately awakens not only Grace but also every member of her family to secrets that allow them to take charge of their prettified hollow lives! Grace's sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick, in yet another of her sensational roles) is a perky, spitfire of a woman who seems to be the only member who has her act together; her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and father Wyly (Robert Duvall) are both able to reveal the old South and the new individuality they achieve; Brett Cullen, Haley Aull, and Muse Watson are all excellent in their roles. One of the most entertaining aspects of this entertaining film is the confrontation between 'old manners' and new reality - with some heady lessons for all of us to observe and allow chuckles. It is a tight little film that deserves another visit on DVD.

But all Hallstr&ouml;m characters are alive (you can identify with them) and about family problems that are presented in this movie there is plenty to talk about. For example, what strong woman like Grace does when she's cheated, how to explain her young daughter that her dad isn't living with them any more; the whole relationship of Bichon's after infidelity. On the other hand, we've got relationship between two sisters, between Wyly and Georgia King and so on. So we've got plenty stuff to talk about only if you think about it for a while. What this script lacks is quality writing of male characters. Duvall's and Quaid's characters are simply not developed enough. About acting part, I must admit that Julia Roberts is very good in this role, just like Kyra Sedgwick and Brett Cullen (his character is the only male character that is made right). Duvall, Rowlands & Quaid have nothing to act, like I said before. But I read one comment that says that Duvall shouldn't act in any movie. That is what made me angry so I had to write it. Man is a screen and stage legend! So to end, if you can watch this family drama about marriage, infidelity and love. It's not the best choice coming from Hallstr&ouml;m but it's a bearable one.

    Enjoyed the great comic acting by Julia Roberts as (Grace King Bichon) who had plenty of family problems with children, grandparents, mother-in-laws and friends. Dennis Quaid,(Eddie Bichon) gives a supporting role as the husband, but I just could not find him suited for this role and especially opposite a great star like Julie Roberts. Quaid just simply did not fit into this role, of course, that is my opinion. Robert Duval,(Wyly King) who was very funny with his southern accent and great supporting role along with Gene Rowlands, (Georgia King) who gets tired of her husband and locks poor old Wyly outside of their huge home. One of Grace King's family members suggests she make a new dish of food for her husband and that is when things get turned all around. A bit Way Out, someone could be put in jail.

    Good movie about gracious southern life mixed with a lot of behavior that is anything but gracious. The movie couldn't seem to decide between being a drama and a comedy, but is nevertheless more than worth watching because of the character played by Kyra Sedgwick. She has at least 2 or 3 of the greatest lines ever uttered in the movies that will make you absolutely fall out with laughter (unless they offend your delicate sensibilities too much). I loved this movie. It shouldn't be taken as seriously as some seem to want to take it. The title indicates to me that they were really aiming at comedy here, and it some places, they really, really hit it.

    Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema. The story is rather slight: Grace (Julia Roberts) is a Southern Belle horse trainer married to handsome but womanizing Eddie (Dennis Quaid) who discovers to her amazement that Eddie is dating other women. This throws Grace into a rage that affects her family, her family's typical Southern response to appearances, and ultimately awakens not only Grace but also every member of her family to secrets that allow them to take charge of their prettified hollow lives! Grace's sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick, in yet another of her sensational roles) is a perky, spitfire of a woman who seems to be the only member who has her act together; her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and father Wyly (Robert Duvall) are both able to reveal the old South and the new individuality they achieve; Brett Cullen, Haley Aull, and Muse Watson are all excellent in their roles. One of the most entertaining aspects of this entertaining film is the confrontation between 'old manners' and new reality - with some heady lessons for all of us to observe and allow chuckles. It is a tight little film that deserves another visit on DVD.

    There are some films that move you. There are some films that make you laugh. There are some films that make you cry. And then there are some films, that mislead you with the tagline, cover of the film and in some cases the preview. This is one such film. After waiting eleven years to finally see this movie, I wondered why I had anticipated it so much. What a let down this film was. I was expecting some cute, romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Denis Quaid, who would argue, and make-up every other scene, and share equal screen time. Wow, was I wrong. No wonder Quaid's name came last on the credits at the beginning of the film. He's hardly worth mentioning. The film is circled more or less on a horse ranch that Grace (Roberts) works on, which is owned by her rich father. She finds her husband (Quaid) one afternoon, cheating on her, and the whole movie is dedicated to her being angry with him, and refusing to forgive him for having cheated on her. However, the reason the tag lines and previews are misleading, is because the movie is more focused on the horse ranch, rather than on her personal situation. I found the movie quite frankly boring, and really of not much interest. Kyra Sedgwick was excellent, and I think I liked her the most out of everyone in the film. I'm not a Robert Duvall fan, so don't ask me what I thought of him, I don't know why he gets casted for any parts, in any films. Gena Rowlands was good as usual...and well what can you say about the sexy and terrific Denis Quaid? He was his usual charming self, and how could you blame anyone for liking him? Julia Roberts, was certainly not at her best, but then better than her non-deserving Oscar award winning performance in "Erin Brockovich." The movie was flat, and lacked so much that it had potential for. I highly not recommend this film, and suggest you check something more along the lines of "Notting Hill" or "Pretty Woman" if you're looking for a good Roberts flick. And if it's Quaid you're interested in, go with, "Innerspace" or "In Good Company". You won't go wrong with any of those, however this one will let you down right from the beginning, and the end won't do you much good either. Because that was not you're typical ending to a film like this. Good luck with it...you're going to need it.

    As a resident the Carolina Coast, one sees the appellation "Lowcountry" on many things including a goodly number of businesses and other entities both public and private. As a descriptor, it is both ubiquitous and quite accurate. Thus , my wife and I were quite surprised to see "Lowcountry Locksmith" on a vehicle in a film that was set in the Kentucky Horse country. I try to catch incongruities and goofs in films as hobby, but my wife spotted this particular one. Knowing that a good portion of this film was shot in the Beaufort, South Carolina area, we enjoyed a quick laugh during that scene.

    This movie had all the essential elements at hand, but somehow it doesn't come together. The main reason is the poor direction by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m. He has done solid movies before, I'm a big fan of Chocolat, but unfortunately he comes off as an amateur here. The viewer never gets a feel for the "geography" of the setting. Important little interactions are barely visible -- for example, when Jamie offers Grace another drink, and she grabs his, it is a potentially comical and telling moment that isn't even on screen. (I couldn't figure it out until watching carefully during the second viewing -- did she grab the bottle? did she take her empty glass? Eventually it appears she has a glass in hand with liquor still in it.) The little girl's acting seemed to be left to chance, and chance didn't do a good job for her. There is frequently a lack of realistic presentation in the sequence of action. One minute Eddie can't breathe after being kicked in the balls, 10 seconds later he is walking normally into the kitchen. The potentially hilarious scene at the women's "cookbook" meeting, when Grace demands to know who else has slept with her husband, was almost ruined by Hallstrom's failure to coordinate line-response. The audience gasps before Grace finishes speaking the essential words in her question. In fact, that whole scene, with its unrealistic, one-dimensional characters, ultimately comes across as condescending toward women. Another fundamental problem with this movie is the plot. Callie Khouri is nothing less than a brilliant screenwriter, but I think she handicapped herself here with post-T and L fears of accusations of "man-hating". Understandable, given the public platform given to all the scary men loudly objecting to the depiction of a woman shooting a rapist ["dear God!"] Callie Khouri's strength is her honest, cut-the-gloss depictions of painful male-female relationships, along with the comedy she brings forth through allowing women an instinctual response to abuse. In this script, however, those moments of comedic and tragic honesty are kept in cages, so that there are little gems scattered throughout, but the movie as a whole does not reflect her native talents.

    I know Callie Khouri thinks she's this huge feminist, but as one, I'm always mystified as to how she arrived at that conclusion. I've never seen Thelma and Louise, but I do watch Nashville (though it's already lather, rinse, repeat and the first season isn't even over!) and I've also seen Divine Secrets (also, just god awful). All three vehicles have verrrry similar elements and a lot of elements seem more like the plot lines of a 1950's pot boiler, not something reasonably modern (and I was turning 30 in 1995, so yeah, I "get" the time frame of this film). Each one features a whiny, spoilt, Southern (usually) Daddy's girl who remains in whatever small community she and her family are near royalty in. Despite the fact that she either hates it there or is at least deeply frustrated by it. This, of course, shows how "sensitive" our heroine is (actually it shows that she can't poop or get off the pot). She also generally is only able to TRULY love her high school sweetheart (weird since Khouri is on her second marriage, to someone she didn't meet until late in life). She also has deep regrets about not being able to achieve her girlhood dreams, even though it's typically something with relatively few obstacles, fairly modest and well, sometimes just life for us mere mortals. In the film Julia/Grace wanted to be a large animal vet and didn't have that much school left to achieve this. She dropped out because she was pregnant and had to get married. But unlike the typical Southern woman, who would now sadly toil at Walmart or Piggly-Wiggly, Julia works for Daddy, managing his fancy stables. Although she "doesn't have time" to return to school (even though somehow I suspect Daddy might be a fairly flexible employer in the scheduling department), she does have time to be an active Junior League Member. Not to mention, she's still able to work around large animals and care for them. She just isn't a vet. Really, very little happens other than everyone chewing scenery and infidelity coming out all over the place. In the end, Julia goes back to Vet school (how she's now able to do this on one income, and move into her own pad with her daughter is never explained, I'll just guess, Daddy). She also takes back pathologically serial cheater Dennis Quaid. Why? Basically cause they dance sexy to Bonnie Raitt in front of everyone (even though a way nicer, cuter dude wants her, but he, of course isn't her high school twu wuv) and he fixes her a nice dinner. Yeah, that's some serious lady empowerment, there!!! Just be pretty, have a rich daddy and ultimately forgive that loser and your life will go from crap to awesome!!!

    This is a FANTASTIC movie in my opinion. This is just a great movie with lots of great one liners and comedy situations that are highly original and just plain fun. I think a lot of people that review movies on here seem to forget that they are made for "entertainment" - it really doesn't matter how realistic or technically correct they are. If you are a someone highly critical of specifics in a movie, you probably wont enjoy this. However, if you are someone who can view it as a movie, and not be overly critical - this is a wonderfully fun time. This is one of Julia Roberts best roles. A truly flustered, very busy mom, that has too much on her plate to deal with everything. But, she seems to handle it anyway.

    Pretentious and a huge waste of talent. Julia Roberts is a great actress and has a fantastic smile – a smile so un-really radiant that it becomes unreal pretty soon. That’s the risk she runs. And so does the movie. Dialogues for the single sister are good while the movie is quite pretentious and a drag at times. Dennis Quaid is fantastic. The story borders on the most idiotic generalization – southern men think with their southern asset and the women don’t have brains at all. Pretty idiotic fare. Gene Rowlands mom lacks depth and looks like she is on prescriptive medication - she takes a 180 degree turn in the middle of the movie. And Duvall's character is so foolish it hurts. The only saving grace is the dance sequence - but then I can bet there have been infinitely better results than this.

    When it comes to directors like Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, I always expect maximum, best, masterpiece. After movies that he made back in Finland and brilliant "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" I think that my expectations were justified. Sadly, this movie came just behind Gilbert so I can live with one mediocre movie after a huge success with Gilbert and then later movie like "The Cider House Rules", "Chocolat"... Hallstr&ouml;m likes to make family movies, where he can expose the whole family with all their pluses and minuses. In this case, story was written by Callie Khouri (Thelma & Louise), typical 'women are always good' writer. In the middle of the story we've got Grace Bichon (Julia Roberts), who founds out that her husband Eddie (Dennis Quaid) is unfaithful. With her daughter, she decides to come back home at ranch. There she must face her traditional father Wyly (Robert Duvall) and mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands), who seems to be doing whatever Wyly wants. The only person who fully understands her is her sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick). I disagree that there is nothing to talk about in this movie. Yes, this movie has some obvious problems: the script is not brilliant which is mostly seen in situations that we've all seen before and characters like Eddie, Wyly and Georgia are written on a way that there is nothing for actors to act. But all Hallstr&ouml;m characters are alive (you can identify with them) and about family problems that are presented in this movie there is plenty to talk about. For example, what strong woman like Grace does when she's cheated, how to explain her young daughter that her dad isn't living with them any more; the whole relationship of Bichon's after infidelity. On the other hand, we've got relationship between two sisters, between Wyly and Georgia King and so on. So we've got plenty stuff to talk about only if you think about it for a while. What this script lacks is quality writing of male characters. Duvall's and Quaid's characters are simply not developed enough. About acting part, I must admit that Julia Roberts is very good in this role, just like Kyra Sedgwick and Brett Cullen (his character is the only male character that is made right). Duvall, Rowlands & Quaid have nothing to act, like I said before. But I read one comment that says that Duvall shouldn't act in any movie. That is what made me angry so I had to write it. Man is a screen and stage legend! So to end, if you can watch this family drama about marriage, infidelity and love. It's not the best choice coming from Hallstr&ouml;m but it's a bearable one.
