    I saw the English version, as a streaming Netflix video in Hi-Def. It is narrated by Kristin Scott Thomas, but really there are only a few sentences at the beginning, and even less at the end. The vast middle of the movie has no narration, only appropriate music as we are left to observe the miniature world. The picture is superb, as it has to be. There is no plot to the "story", and it doesn't attempt to encompass all of the miniature world of insects. It simply gives us, the viewers, a series of brief glimpses into their everyday world. We see ants busily moving a variety of grain into their tunnels. In a different clip we see a colorful bird, perhaps a Pheasant, busily pecking and eating ants who have no clue as to "protection". We see a spider and its web, and how it uses the web to wrap up a small grasshopper that happens to jump into captivity. We see a mighty struggle, a battle, between two large beetles. And in another clip, a Dung Beetle working mightily to successfully roll its ball of dung to its burrow. Plus many, many more small critters. The image saved for last is an impressive one, we see what looks like a giant sea monster rising slowly out of the water, and when it is over we realize it is a mosquito emerging from its larval state and then flying away. A wonderful viewing experience for anyone who is at all fascinated by the miniature world around us.

    Filmmakers Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou use unique microscopic cameras and powerfully specialized microphones to look into the lifestyles of insects and minute creatures in an ordinary French meadow and pond. Up close and personal using slow motion and time-lapse photography; footage of ladybugs mating, snails doing their slimy coupling, spiders waiting and pouncing on prey, caterpillars on the march, bees pollinating...and a moderate rain hardly interrupts the micro flora and fauna, but the tiny creatures deal with danger. This documentary won five Cesar Awards at the 1996 French Academy of Cinema Awards; one for Best Cinematography and another for Best Music scored by composer Bruno Coulais. MICROCOSMOS is narrated by Jacques Perrin and Kristin Scott Thomas.

    This innovative, often highly entertaining film is spoiled only by its insistence on overstaying its welcome (by about fifteen minutes). Directors Nuridsany and Perinnou explore a world about which we know very little, and understand even less. The amazing close-up photography reveals a veritable society that is as intricate as it is interdependent. The world of the insects is a fascinating, oft times amusing one peopled with hard working, organised ants, frantic bees, hungry birds and determined beetles, just to name a few. "Microcosmos" reveals this hidden mystery as a place where "a day is a lifetime". Truly this movie is testimony to the unfathomable God who created this awe-inspiring world in which we live.

    Thoroughly enjoyable film, although I did at least in the beginning want more explanation. I wanted to know what that particular spider (or other creature) was called. I wanted to hear things like "Lucky catch. Sometimes a spider will sit for days without a meal." (I don't really know if that's the case.) Little bits of information like that would have been welcome. But then I became absorbed and realized that it was enough just to observe and learn what was available visually. The use of music to tell the story was not perfect, but good enough. I apparently do not enjoy snail mating as much as the film-makers though, because they chose absolutely beautiful music and it went on entirely too long. Strange. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this one and I would watch it again. It turns out that when you know more about them and can see their beauty this tiny creatures don't seem so creepy any more.

    I'm all for innovation and creativity. Quite happy with weird films. But this is just a film of bugs coming and going, going about their normal daily business. Yes, of course they're nicely photographed, and the flowers they visit have lovely bright colours. But it's not really a film, is it? I tried with Microcosmos. At first, I though I was waiting for the dialogue to kick in. But no. And then, I thought the beetle activity would form into a plot - maybe it does, but I simply couldn't get it. I think it was this belief - that it would somehow form itself into a story - that kept me from walking out. But when it finally ended I was none the wiser, and wished I hadn't bothered.

    The second time I watched this I started wondering whether there was any difference between this and the 'cute' anthropomorphic Disney films I own on Super 8. Take away forty years of lens technology and you're left with "Sloth vs. Jaguar", right? Well not quite - for one thing it's erotic, thanks in part but not entirely to the enhanced capacity for intimacy that those lenses provide. For another, it's got a bit of a structure, and it aims for mystery. Also, it confines the stupid voice-over to the bookends, not that I wouldn't rather that they dispatched it entirely, which goes double for the sporadic John Villiamsisms of the soundtrack. While I eventually stopped suspecting CGI, I do not doubt that some of it was staged, including one of my favourite scenes, the dung beetle rolling the dirt ball. Still, there's a lot of beauty in here, and even some small portion of the 'mystery' is justified by the content. We'd been waiting to see some of these facts of life first-hand for a long, long time.

    i was disappointed in this documentary for two main reasons.the first thing is,sometimes i swear the insects/bugs/creepy crawlies were CG in some shots and hand made,out of cloth or something,in others.a lot of them just didn't look realistic to me.other than that though,there were some very beautifully photographed scenes.there were also some grotesque scenes though.and there were also some humorous moments.there is almost no narration,save for the opening and one other part,so if you need a bit of context,you might not like this film.i did find that it did sort of jump around a lot aimlessly.i did find that the film was slow at times.i found it watchable,but nothing spectacular.plus,those two reasons i mentioned earlier that made me disappointed,really took me out of the movie.i could be way out too lunch,and maybe the creatures really do look like they are depicted in the documentary.i'm sure some of them do.anyway,i give Microcosmos a 5/10

    That's how good this documentary is! I simply mentioned the snail couple because that particular scene made such a strong impact on me. I never saw more affection and love in the animal world...the two brown snails were, honest to God, kissing. Actually, they were all over each other:) I find it a little disturbing that some previous posters don't qualify "Microcosmos" as a documentary. I think that it didn't need to narrate and explain what it was about, but it indeed documented something, a part of the beautiful nature that surrounds us. The fact that so little human "presence" is required makes it even more enjoyable and somehow, pure. It is truly mesmerizing and captivating, like watching a beautiful moving painting that relaxes the body and soul. How better to honor nature?

    I am still not sure if it is counted as a documentary or film, but this does not matter. I always liked nature so this movie is near to my spirits. I wished to see it as 3D but I think that such a release has not come up yet. The movie does not need any comment or subtitles. Just watch it. Keep on and you will learn who you are and where you live. The documentary is about everything, although it focused mainly on insects. You can imagine what just an innocent step in microcosmos can cause. All these little cuties and monsters have their own world and microcosmos maps it with a mild sight. French are great at such documentaries and this can be seen as a kind of conclusion. Beautiful shots, I can imagine setting the camera for hours, waiting for proceeding of an ant and then show all that crusade during several seconds. Maybe it seems that this kind of movie does not need any screenplay, but I do not agree with it. When you watch it, you find out it made some sense. Insects also behave according to schedules and needs. Actually, there is no point in describing the movie here, you must see it and you will want more to see. Beautiful beauty.

    This is a French-made nature film that features a lot of closeup photography. Much of that footage is amazing stuff. How they got closeups that sharp on these insects is a tribute to the camera lenses available today and the expertise and patience of the photographers. Some of the shots are so close that, at first, you don't know what insect you're seeing. Other insects are not familiar ones you'd recognize, anyway. Some are really strange-looking. The colors, the wild shapes and actions of these creatures all make a for a fascinating movie in parts, one that literally all ages should enjoy, as the clich&eacute; goes. I found, however, that with no dialog, it was tough to watch more than 30 minutes at one time. You might want to break this up into two or three segments. There is sound, however: the sound these insects make. With the camera-work, it makes you feel as if you, too, were a small object on the ground listening to these strange sounds. Obviously, this is a unique film and highly recommended.

I wanted to hear things like "Lucky catch. Sometimes a spider will sit for days without a meal." (I don't really know if that's the case.) Little bits of information like that would have been welcome. But then I became absorbed and realized that it was enough just to observe and learn what was available visually. The use of music to tell the story was not perfect, but good enough. I apparently do not enjoy snail mating as much as the film-makers though, because they chose absolutely beautiful music and it went on entirely too long. Strange. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this one and I would watch it again. It turns out that when you know more about them and can see their beauty this tiny creatures don't seem so creepy any more.

    I'm all for innovation and creativity. Quite happy with weird films. But this is just a film of bugs coming and going, going about their normal daily business. Yes, of course they're nicely photographed, and the flowers they visit have lovely bright colours. But it's not really a film, is it? I tried with Microcosmos. At first, I though I was waiting for the dialogue to kick in. But no. And then, I thought the beetle activity would form into a plot - maybe it does, but I simply couldn't get it.

I never saw more affection and love in the animal world...the two brown snails were, honest to God, kissing. Actually, they were all over each other:) I find it a little disturbing that some previous posters don't qualify "Microcosmos" as a documentary. I think that it didn't need to narrate and explain what it was about, but it indeed documented something, a part of the beautiful nature that surrounds us.

I wished to see it as 3D but I think that such a release has not come up yet. The movie does not need any comment or subtitles. Just watch it. Keep on and you will learn who you are and where you live. The documentary is about everything, although it focused mainly on insects. You can imagine what just an innocent step in microcosmos can cause. All these little cuties and monsters have their own world and microcosmos maps it with a mild sight. French are great at such documentaries and this can be seen as a kind of conclusion. Beautiful shots, I can imagine setting the camera for hours, waiting for proceeding of an ant and then show all that crusade during several seconds. Maybe it seems that this kind of movie does not need any screenplay, but I do not agree with it. When you watch it, you find out it made some sense. Insects also behave according to schedules and needs. Actually, there is no point in describing the movie here, you must see it and you will want more to see. Beautiful beauty.

    This is a French-made nature film that features a lot of closeup photography. Much of that footage is amazing stuff. How they got closeups that sharp on these insects is a tribute to the camera lenses available today and the expertise and patience of the photographers. Some of the shots are so close that, at first, you don't know what insect you're seeing. Other insects are not familiar ones you'd recognize, anyway. Some are really strange-looking. The colors, the wild shapes and actions of these creatures all make a for a fascinating movie in parts, one that literally all ages should enjoy, as the clich&eacute; goes. I found, however, that with no dialog, it was tough to watch more than 30 minutes at one time. You might want to break this up into two or three segments. There is sound, however: the sound these insects make. With the camera-work, it makes you feel as if you, too, were a small object on the ground listening to these strange sounds. Obviously, this is a unique film and highly recommended.

    I saw the English version, as a streaming Netflix video in Hi-Def. It is narrated by Kristin Scott Thomas, but really there are only a few sentences at the beginning, and even less at the end. The vast middle of the movie has no narration, only appropriate music as we are left to observe the miniature world. The picture is superb, as it has to be. There is no plot to the "story", and it doesn't attempt to encompass all of the miniature world of insects. It simply gives us, the viewers, a series of brief glimpses into their everyday world. We see ants busily moving a variety of grain into their tunnels. In a different clip we see a colorful bird, perhaps a Pheasant, busily pecking and eating ants who have no clue as to "protection". We see a spider and its web, and how it uses the web to wrap up a small grasshopper that happens to jump into captivity. We see a mighty struggle, a battle, between two large beetles. And in another clip, a Dung Beetle working mightily to successfully roll its ball of dung to its burrow. Plus many, many more small critters. The image saved for last is an impressive one, we see what looks like a giant sea monster rising slowly out of the water, and when it is over we realize it is a mosquito emerging from its larval state and then flying away. A wonderful viewing experience for anyone who is at all fascinated by the miniature world around us.

    Filmmakers Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou use unique microscopic cameras and powerfully specialized microphones to look into the lifestyles of insects and minute creatures in an ordinary French meadow and pond. Up close and personal using slow motion and time-lapse photography; footage of ladybugs mating, snails doing their slimy coupling, spiders waiting and pouncing on prey, caterpillars on the march, bees pollinating...and a moderate rain hardly interrupts the micro flora and fauna, but the tiny creatures deal with danger. This documentary won five Cesar Awards at the 1996 French Academy of Cinema Awards; one for Best Cinematography and another for Best Music scored by composer Bruno Coulais. MICROCOSMOS is narrated by Jacques Perrin and Kristin Scott Thomas.

    This innovative, often highly entertaining film is spoiled only by its insistence on overstaying its welcome (by about fifteen minutes). Directors Nuridsany and Perinnou explore a world about which we know very little, and understand even less. The amazing close-up photography reveals a veritable society that is as intricate as it is interdependent. The world of the insects is a fascinating, oft times amusing one peopled with hard working, organised ants, frantic bees, hungry birds and determined beetles, just to name a few. "Microcosmos" reveals this hidden mystery as a place where "a day is a lifetime". Truly this movie is testimony to the unfathomable God who created this awe-inspiring world in which we live.

Yes, of course they're nicely photographed, and the flowers they visit have lovely bright colours. But it's not really a film, is it? I tried with Microcosmos. At first, I though I was waiting for the dialogue to kick in. But no. And then, I thought the beetle activity would form into a plot - maybe it does, but I simply couldn't get it.

    The second time I watched this I started wondering whether there was any difference between this and the 'cute' anthropomorphic Disney films I own on Super 8. Take away forty years of lens technology and you're left with "Sloth vs. Jaguar", right? Well not quite - for one thing it's erotic, thanks in part but not entirely to the enhanced capacity for intimacy that those lenses provide. For another, it's got a bit of a structure, and it aims for mystery. Also, it confines the stupid voice-over to the bookends, not that I wouldn't rather that they dispatched it entirely, which goes double for the sporadic John Villiamsisms of the soundtrack. While I eventually stopped suspecting CGI, I do not doubt that some of it was staged, including one of my favourite scenes, the dung beetle rolling the dirt ball.

You can imagine what just an innocent step in microcosmos can cause. All these little cuties and monsters have their own world and microcosmos maps it with a mild sight. French are great at such documentaries and this can be seen as a kind of conclusion. Beautiful shots, I can imagine setting the camera for hours, waiting for proceeding of an ant and then show all that crusade during several seconds. Maybe it seems that this kind of movie does not need any screenplay, but I do not agree with it. When you watch it, you find out it made some sense. Insects also behave according to schedules and needs. Actually, there is no point in describing the movie here, you must see it and you will want more to see. Beautiful beauty.

    This is a French-made nature film that features a lot of closeup photography. Much of that footage is amazing stuff. How they got closeups that sharp on these insects is a tribute to the camera lenses available today and the expertise and patience of the photographers. Some of the shots are so close that, at first, you don't know what insect you're seeing. Other insects are not familiar ones you'd recognize, anyway. Some are really strange-looking. The colors, the wild shapes and actions of these creatures all make a for a fascinating movie in parts, one that literally all ages should enjoy, as the clich&eacute; goes. I found, however, that with no dialog, it was tough to watch more than 30 minutes at one time. You might want to break this up into two or three segments. There is sound, however: the sound these insects make. With the camera-work, it makes you feel as if you, too, were a small object on the ground listening to these strange sounds. Obviously, this is a unique film and highly recommended.
