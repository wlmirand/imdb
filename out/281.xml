 <sinopse>
  Rafting expert Gail takes on a pair of armed killers while navigating a spectacularly violent river.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Gail, an expert at white water rafting, takes her family on a trip down the river to their family's house. Along the way, the family encounters two men who are unexperienced rafters that need to find their friends down river. Later, the family finds out that the pair of men are armed robbers. The men then physically force the family to take them down the river to meet their accomplices. The rafting trip for the family is definitely ruined, but most importantly, their lives are at stake.

    This is a good drama, set to nice scenery and enough action to keep it afloat on a "river Wild" of course. Three bandidos (sounds cooler than bandits, so I'll say it) are on this "river wild", as are a man, his wife, and their son. Issues arise between the couple, and when the two groups meet, one of the bandidos is dead, and the husband becomes weakened, which of course you know, because Meryl Streep has to be the star. This is all leading up to a final confrontation with the psychopath played by Kevin Bacon. So what makes this interesting is the wild card. The accomplice, played by Reilly, is not any of the stereotypes we are used to seeing. He is not the sicko, killer, maniac, or complete low life. Neither is he the good hearted kid who means well. He is the one we don't know throughout the movie, and that plays a key role in its ending. It ends with a decision that must be made by Meryl Streep, when she has one bullet for two men. One with the physical force and power of the knife. The other with the mental control. It becomes a throwback to the bad guys from "Rope" in a way. Does she make the right decision? Does she miss completely? I won't spoil that.

    What To Say,LOVED IT! Kevin Bacon's Role Was Bit Of Creepy As For The Role Of A Villain. Meryl Steep- Pure Natural in The Movie. Extremely Non-Twisted And Easily Understandable. May not be such a great one for the once who can't afford to waste time listening to long dialogs.. Some Scenes Maybe Intense for people who can't watch psycho movies. Overall Great One. My Verdict: 8.6/10 Is It Okay To Watch While With Family? OK. Sexual Content- 0%|Lip-lock Kissing-2%|Profanity 10%|Violence(action)-39%|Grotesque Violence And Gore- 3%|Drug Use- 0% A Review By SidharthSKumar

    There is a sub-genre of the romantic comedy known as the "comedy of remarriage". Such films generally deal with a divorced or estranged couple, or a couple whose marriage has been going through a difficult patch, rediscovering their love for one another. They were especially popular in the thirties and forties, but there have been a number of recent examples such as "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" "The River Wild" can be seen as a "thriller of remarriage". Like "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" it deals with a big-city couple whose marriage is in trouble but who manage to save it while on a trip to a rural part of the American West. The difference between the two films, apart from the fact that the motive for that trip is quite different in each case, is that "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" tells its story in the form of a comedy, "The River Wild" in the form of a serious thriller. Tom and Gail, a middle-class Boston couple, are having marital problems. Gail, a teacher of deaf children, feels that Tom, an architect, spends too much time at work and neglects his family. Gail is originally from Idaho, and decides to take her young children Roarke and Willa on holiday to see her parents, who still live in that state. Gail is also an expert at whitewater rafting, and before her move to Boston worked as a rafting guide on a local river. (The "river wild" of the title; the film-makers may have chosen this unconventional word order to avoid confusion with "Wild River", the 1960 film directed by Elia Kazan). She decides to take Roarke on a holiday rafting trip down the river, Willa (who stays with her grandparents) presumably being too young to come along. At the last minute Tom joins them, and the three set off on their trip together. Near the beginning of their trip, the family meet two other rafters, Wade and Terry. At first the two men appear to be friendly, but Gail slowly becomes suspicious of them, and she and Tom decide to leave them behind. The attempt fails, and Wade pulls a gun on them. It transpires that the two men are criminals who have just committed a robbery and are using the river as a means of escape; they need Gail's rafting skills to get them past the Gauntlet, a particularly dangerous stretch of river. The rest of the film tells of the family's efforts to thwart the robbers and of how their shared danger helps to mend the relationship between Gail and Tom. The film marked something of a new departure for Meryl Streep, previously often seen as a rather serious, cerebral actress. Although she had made occasional ventures into comedy, in films like "She-Devil" and "Death Becomes Her", this was her first appearance as an action heroine. It is not the sort of role which she has reprised since 1994, but she makes the most of it here; she even, apparently, performed most of her own stunts. David Strathairn, more often seen in supporting roles, here achieves leading man status as Tom. There is also a good performance from Kevin Bacon, generally a reliable villain, as Wade, at first friendly and plausible, later a raging psychopath. (John C. Reilly's Terry seems almost likable by comparison). Curtis Hanson is not a particularly prolific director; in a career lasting nearly forty years he has only made fourteen films. Some of those, however, especially in the thriller genre, have been good ones, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" and the excellent neo-noir "L.A. Confidential". "The River Wild" is another example of Hanson at his best, even though there are occasional implausible moments; some of the characters- especially Tom, the bespectacled, nerdish-looking architect- occasionally perform feats of strength or agility more often seen in superhero movies. The basic story- family menaced by violent criminals- may be an over-familiar one, but it is certainly handled in an exciting manner here. Curtis's direction is brilliant; this is one thriller that is genuinely worthy of the name, moving along at a cracking pace. The scenes on the river, especially when Gail is taking the raft down the Gauntlet, are heart-stopping. The cinematography of the beautiful wild scenery of the Pacific North-West is magnificent. "The River Wild" must count as one of the best-made thrillers of the nineties. 8/10

    Gail (Meryl Streep) is a white water rafting guide. She, husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazello) are kidnapped by robbers Wade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry (John C Reilly), who see rafting down the river as an effective escape route. It's pretty easy to understand the casting decisions for Bacon, Reilly and Strathairn, but Streep isn't the most obvious choice for action Mom Gail. Yet, as usual, she is superb (as is everyone else). The underlying marital problems give her a great deal to get her teeth into, but she also excels as the woman called upon to be a protective mother, a defiant hostage and someone on whose expertise on the river everyone's survival depends. Bacon is gloriously evil, a happy-go-lucky psychopath who is always a credible threat. And the action is terrific - lots of it, spectacular, beautiful, and clearly involving the actors a lot of the time, it makes this film a most enjoyable roller coaster ride (or white water rafting ride, I should say), and a movie which should have a higher profile than it has.

    A different role for Meryl Streep, as a former river guide with domestic problems. Her husband is always at work and their marriage is on the rocks. She decides to take a trip with her young son down the safe part of a river. At the starting point she meets three men; Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly are the two main protagonists. They claim to be on a fishing trip and off the merry threesome go on their way. Her husband shows up unexpectedly; played perfectly by David Strathairn. A short time later, the family meet up with Bacon and Reilly, who claim that the third guy had to leave because of an emergency. All is well at first, but the good times turn bad rather quickly, as the two buddies are revealed as criminal types who have committed a robbery and are on the run, and need Streep's expertise to make it through a treacherous pass on the river. The water and its' surroundings are beautiful, and an awesome Yellow Lab ads to a great cast. The story becomes a bit far fetched, but hey, just sit back and watch Meryl having a ball as she navigates a raft down the river.

    Gail is a professional at water rafting. She twigs every day, and she is in a very good shape. She takes her family, one day, to a rafting trip down the river, but she has no idea that the planned trip is about to become a nightmare. Two escaping robbers with a handgun, meet the family in the way, and join them to the trip. Only later Gail realises that their new friends are dangerous criminals, but it's too late. The two men force them to stay together, and to keep cruising down the river. The family's life are risked not only by the two men, but also by the river which becomes more stormy and wilder.... Thefirst thing that you notice about this movie is that it's the first time since 'Aliens' that a woman has taken the lead in a Hollywood action movie. Streep is an odd choice, but as the heroine, she really brings a vulnerability to her character which makes her wholly believable. The story isn't up to much, but thanks to such good direction and brilliant rapid sequences, this becomes more than an average thriller. Bacon is as sinister as needed, but he too has his vulnerable side. Sub plots involving marriage break ups and Benjamin Bratt are an added bonus, and Joseph Mazello proves he wasn't a one trick pony in Jurassic park, he's just as annoying in this. It's a shame it's not a well remembered movie, because it is a thrilling movie with some wonderful performances.

    Gail (Meryl Streep), brings her workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke along on a white river rafting trip for a bit of family bonding and partially to salvage what's left of her declining marriage. The family vacation turns awry however, when they stumble across two mysterious strangers (Kevin Bacon & John C Reilly) who are in need of help as, so they claim, they are stuck in the middle of nowhere and need Gail to help them get out. Gail previously having worked as a guide on the river agrees. This is their story which differs somewhat to the actual truth as to what they are up to and soon husband Tom gets suspicious of the pair, as well he might! What follows is a roller-coaster ride of thrills, splashes, action and tension which successfully make this 90's action thriller a force to be reckoned with. It manages to keep the audience entertained and enthralled as Streep goes head to head with the two villains and of course the gushing river that cuts through the movie. The River Wild does what it says on the tin, all the while refraining from hiding behind any CGI effects, instead just using good old fashioned stunt work and great acting. Directed by Curtis Hanson who had previously directed 'The Hand That Rocked The Cradle', he uses his previous skill in pumping up the tension successfully and there are some great moments that make you wonder what is going to happen next. Meryl Streep is great as usual and plays the strong, level-headed female lead well, yet still with an air of vulnerability at the same time. Kevin Bacon is an excellent primary antagonist as Wade, along with his dumb partner in crime Terry. It's actually fun to watch as he uses his superficial charm to gain the trust of Gail and her family and then switching to a malevolent bad guy as soon as his motives are exposed. The scenes between Streep and Bacon are tense and dark which increases the pace even further. There are strong supporting characters too, including David Strathairn's serious yet underestimated husband role. Joseph Mazzello, from Jurassic Park fame, is Gail's son who puts in a good performance here. Benjamin Bratt also makes a small appearance as a guide on the river. John C Reilly appears in an early career role and has since had stronger roles in film. I have rated this film highly as it kept me entertained throughout. This is mainly due to the acting and direction which keep the pace going at break neck speed. Good old 90's action thriller.

    Curtis Hanson's box office hit 'The River Wild' is well-shot and even gripping in parts, but what really stands tall in this thriller and balances the film even when it dips, are the performances by it's talented star-cast. The story involves a family on a whitewater rafting trip, who encounter two violent criminals in the wilderness. 'The River Wild', which has been written by Denis O'Neill, offers some gripping moments, that truly manage to hold your attention. The characters, are nicely presented and executed. But, I would like to point out, that, the writing in the latter hour tends to drag a bit. The film surely could've been shorter by at least 10-15 minutes. And I believe if it had been trimmed, it's impact would have only enhanced. Curtis Hanson's direction, like always, is efficient. Cinematography is Striking. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: Meryl Streep is superb, as expected. She carries the film on her shoulders and delivers with ease in each and every scene. Kevin Bacon makes a really interesting bad guy, and proves his potential as an actor. David Strathaim is first-rate. John C. Reilly is good. Joseph Mazzello supports well. On the whole, A decent one-time watch, that offers strong performances to sail it safe.

    In Meryl Streep's astonishingly awards-packing filmography, this film has no chance to be singled out (not even among top 20 maybe), it actually botched the chance of Meryl's Oscar nomination that year (after a surprisingly gratifying Golden Globe nomination), I think it is its skin-deep kernel and the entertainment-first priority sabotaged it, if only speaking of the cast, Meryl's acting is completely Oscar-worthy. From A to Z, this intense adventure thriller holds one's breath tight with its suspenseful aura and splendid river torrent scenes, however the throwaway adrenalin-thrusting doesn't guarantee the same amount aftertaste, there are a touch indelible plot-holes emerging into my mind, which I assure you it is not a pleasant feeling (still, it's much better than most annoying pop-corn movies which I cannot even fluently commit myself to the moment). Meryl proves once again that she is the most versatile actress if not in the world, at least in Hollywood. The sports/action area is a rare attempt, yet she did most of her stunts, which is surely not able to be learnt from acting classes I suppose. With respect to the fore-mentioned skin-deep kernel, I have a hunch that both feminist and non-feminist would feel offended on account of in one hand the female protagonist's tough prevalence over her husband would exasperate man's ego, in the other hand, the inward- for-no-reason husband eventually resurrected his role-model father/husband image would be too obvious to feel empathetic (especially after a ludicrous rescue ploy). Poor David Strathairn, he had tried his best to save this badly-designed character. As for poor Kevin Bacon, he has been vying for an Oscar nomination since then, still in vain. (I would have taken Susan Sarandon's nomination for THE CLIENT to Meryl and also given one to the viciously- charming Kevin Bacon).

    I'll grant that the last 15 minutes or so of "The River Wild" are a pretty exciting and suspenseful white water rafting adventure. The unfortunate thing about it is that these are only the last 15 minutes or so. Up to that point what we have is a pretty slow moving river journey, with the added complication, of course, being that the troubled family on the trip finds more trouble as they pick up a couple of guys who robbed the local cattle auction. In the end the movie turns out to be pretty formulaic, with movements and plot points that we've definitely seen before - many times, in fact. Meryl Streep was an interesting choice as Gail - mother and white water guide - and while she was interesting (basically because this isn't what you'd think of as a normal Meryl Streep role) I didn't find her convincing in the part, either (which is probably why it's not a normal Meryl Streep role!) Kevin Bacon was somewhat more credible as Wade, the guy apparently in charge of the robbery, who decides to take the family hostage in order to use Gail's rafting expertise to run a particularly deadly river in the hopes of escaping the law. Along for the ride were David Strathairn as Gail's husband, John C. Reilly as Wade's sidekick and Joseph Mazzello as young Roarke, Gail's son. It's a decent enough cast. The story isn't especially original, though, and I just didn't find the movie to be all that exciting. Watching a rafting trip (which is essentially what we do for the bulk of this movie) with a few bits of drama thrown in as we become gradually more suspicious of the two strangers doesn't exactly make for a gripping two hours of viewing. There is, of course, the requisite ending as it seems that all the family's troubles are solved by having gone through this adventure together. (3/10)

    Gail is a professional at water rafting. She twigs every day, and she is in a very good shape. She takes her family, one day, to a rafting trip down the river, but she has no idea that the planned trip is about to become a nightmare. Two escaping robbers with a handgun, meet the family in the way, and join them to the trip. Only later Gail realises that their new friends are dangerous criminals, but it's too late. The two men force them to stay together, and to keep cruising down the river. The family's life are risked not only by the two men, but also by the river which becomes more stormy and wilder.... Thefirst thing that you notice about this movie is that it's the first time since 'Aliens' that a woman has taken the lead in a Hollywood action movie. Streep is an odd choice, but as the heroine, she really brings a vulnerability to her character which makes her wholly believable. The story isn't up to much, but thanks to such good direction and brilliant rapid sequences, this becomes more than an average thriller. Bacon is as sinister as needed, but he too has his vulnerable side. Sub plots involving marriage break ups and Benjamin Bratt are an added bonus, and Joseph Mazello proves he wasn't a one trick pony in Jurassic park, he's just as annoying in this. It's a shame it's not a well remembered movie, because it is a thrilling movie with some wonderful performances.

    Gail (Meryl Streep), brings her workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke along on a white river rafting trip for a bit of family bonding and partially to salvage what's left of her declining marriage. The family vacation turns awry however, when they stumble across two mysterious strangers (Kevin Bacon & John C Reilly) who are in need of help as, so they claim, they are stuck in the middle of nowhere and need Gail to help them get out. Gail previously having worked as a guide on the river agrees. This is their story which differs somewhat to the actual truth as to what they are up to and soon husband Tom gets suspicious of the pair, as well he might! What follows is a roller-coaster ride of thrills, splashes, action and tension which successfully make this 90's action thriller a force to be reckoned with. It manages to keep the audience entertained and enthralled as Streep goes head to head with the two villains and of course the gushing river that cuts through the movie. The River Wild does what it says on the tin, all the while refraining from hiding behind any CGI effects, instead just using good old fashioned stunt work and great acting. Directed by Curtis Hanson who had previously directed 'The Hand That Rocked The Cradle', he uses his previous skill in pumping up the tension successfully and there are some great moments that make you wonder what is going to happen next. Meryl Streep is great as usual and plays the strong, level-headed female lead well, yet still with an air of vulnerability at the same time. Kevin Bacon is an excellent primary antagonist as Wade, along with his dumb partner in crime Terry. It's actually fun to watch as he uses his superficial charm to gain the trust of Gail and her family and then switching to a malevolent bad guy as soon as his motives are exposed. The scenes between Streep and Bacon are tense and dark which increases the pace even further. There are strong supporting characters too, including David Strathairn's serious yet underestimated husband role. Joseph Mazzello, from Jurassic Park fame, is Gail's son who puts in a good performance here. Benjamin Bratt also makes a small appearance as a guide on the river. John C Reilly appears in an early career role and has since had stronger roles in film. I have rated this film highly as it kept me entertained throughout. This is mainly due to the acting and direction which keep the pace going at break neck speed. Good old 90's action thriller.

    Curtis Hanson's box office hit 'The River Wild' is well-shot and even gripping in parts, but what really stands tall in this thriller and balances the film even when it dips, are the performances by it's talented star-cast. The story involves a family on a whitewater rafting trip, who encounter two violent criminals in the wilderness. 'The River Wild', which has been written by Denis O'Neill, offers some gripping moments, that truly manage to hold your attention. The characters, are nicely presented and executed. But, I would like to point out, that, the writing in the latter hour tends to drag a bit. The film surely could've been shorter by at least 10-15 minutes. And I believe if it had been trimmed, it's impact would have only enhanced. Curtis Hanson's direction, like always, is efficient. Cinematography is Striking. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: Meryl Streep is superb, as expected. She carries the film on her shoulders and delivers with ease in each and every scene. Kevin Bacon makes a really interesting bad guy, and proves his potential as an actor. David Strathaim is first-rate. John C. Reilly is good. Joseph Mazzello supports well. On the whole, A decent one-time watch, that offers strong performances to sail it safe.

    In Meryl Streep's astonishingly awards-packing filmography, this film has no chance to be singled out (not even among top 20 maybe), it actually botched the chance of Meryl's Oscar nomination that year (after a surprisingly gratifying Golden Globe nomination), I think it is its skin-deep kernel and the entertainment-first priority sabotaged it, if only speaking of the cast, Meryl's acting is completely Oscar-worthy. From A to Z, this intense adventure thriller holds one's breath tight with its suspenseful aura and splendid river torrent scenes, however the throwaway adrenalin-thrusting doesn't guarantee the same amount aftertaste, there are a touch indelible plot-holes emerging into my mind, which I assure you it is not a pleasant feeling (still, it's much better than most annoying pop-corn movies which I cannot even fluently commit myself to the moment). Meryl proves once again that she is the most versatile actress if not in the world, at least in Hollywood. The sports/action area is a rare attempt, yet she did most of her stunts, which is surely not able to be learnt from acting classes I suppose. With respect to the fore-mentioned skin-deep kernel, I have a hunch that both feminist and non-feminist would feel offended on account of in one hand the female protagonist's tough prevalence over her husband would exasperate man's ego, in the other hand, the inward- for-no-reason husband eventually resurrected his role-model father/husband image would be too obvious to feel empathetic (especially after a ludicrous rescue ploy). Poor David Strathairn, he had tried his best to save this badly-designed character. As for poor Kevin Bacon, he has been vying for an Oscar nomination since then, still in vain. (I would have taken Susan Sarandon's nomination for THE CLIENT to Meryl and also given one to the viciously- charming Kevin Bacon).

    I'll grant that the last 15 minutes or so of "The River Wild" are a pretty exciting and suspenseful white water rafting adventure. The unfortunate thing about it is that these are only the last 15 minutes or so. Up to that point what we have is a pretty slow moving river journey, with the added complication, of course, being that the troubled family on the trip finds more trouble as they pick up a couple of guys who robbed the local cattle auction. In the end the movie turns out to be pretty formulaic, with movements and plot points that we've definitely seen before - many times, in fact. Meryl Streep was an interesting choice as Gail - mother and white water guide - and while she was interesting (basically because this isn't what you'd think of as a normal Meryl Streep role) I didn't find her convincing in the part, either (which is probably why it's not a normal Meryl Streep role!) Kevin Bacon was somewhat more credible as Wade, the guy apparently in charge of the robbery, who decides to take the family hostage in order to use Gail's rafting expertise to run a particularly deadly river in the hopes of escaping the law. Along for the ride were David Strathairn as Gail's husband, John C. Reilly as Wade's sidekick and Joseph Mazzello as young Roarke, Gail's son. It's a decent enough cast. The story isn't especially original, though, and I just didn't find the movie to be all that exciting. Watching a rafting trip (which is essentially what we do for the bulk of this movie) with a few bits of drama thrown in as we become gradually more suspicious of the two strangers doesn't exactly make for a gripping two hours of viewing. There is, of course, the requisite ending as it seems that all the family's troubles are solved by having gone through this adventure together. (3/10)

    This is a good drama, set to nice scenery and enough action to keep it afloat on a "river Wild" of course. Three bandidos (sounds cooler than bandits, so I'll say it) are on this "river wild", as are a man, his wife, and their son. Issues arise between the couple, and when the two groups meet, one of the bandidos is dead, and the husband becomes weakened, which of course you know, because Meryl Streep has to be the star. This is all leading up to a final confrontation with the psychopath played by Kevin Bacon. So what makes this interesting is the wild card. The accomplice, played by Reilly, is not any of the stereotypes we are used to seeing. He is not the sicko, killer, maniac, or complete low life. Neither is he the good hearted kid who means well. He is the one we don't know throughout the movie, and that plays a key role in its ending. It ends with a decision that must be made by Meryl Streep, when she has one bullet for two men. One with the physical force and power of the knife. The other with the mental control. It becomes a throwback to the bad guys from "Rope" in a way. Does she make the right decision? Does she miss completely? I won't spoil that.

    Thriller of Remarriage

    There is a sub-genre of the romantic comedy known as the "comedy of remarriage". Such films generally deal with a divorced or estranged couple, or a couple whose marriage has been going through a difficult patch, rediscovering their love for one another. They were especially popular in the thirties and forties, but there have been a number of recent examples such as "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" "The River Wild" can be seen as a "thriller of remarriage". Like "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" it deals with a big-city couple whose marriage is in trouble but who manage to save it while on a trip to a rural part of the American West. The difference between the two films, apart from the fact that the motive for that trip is quite different in each case, is that "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" tells its story in the form of a comedy, "The River Wild" in the form of a serious thriller. Tom and Gail, a middle-class Boston couple, are having marital problems. Gail, a teacher of deaf children, feels that Tom, an architect, spends too much time at work and neglects his family. Gail is originally from Idaho, and decides to take her young children Roarke and Willa on holiday to see her parents, who still live in that state. Gail is also an expert at whitewater rafting, and before her move to Boston worked as a rafting guide on a local river. (The "river wild" of the title; the film-makers may have chosen this unconventional word order to avoid confusion with "Wild River", the 1960 film directed by Elia Kazan). She decides to take Roarke on a holiday rafting trip down the river, Willa (who stays with her grandparents) presumably being too young to come along. At the last minute Tom joins them, and the three set off on their trip together. Near the beginning of their trip, the family meet two other rafters, Wade and Terry. At first the two men appear to be friendly, but Gail slowly becomes suspicious of them, and she and Tom decide to leave them behind. The attempt fails, and Wade pulls a gun on them. It transpires that the two men are criminals who have just committed a robbery and are using the river as a means of escape; they need Gail's rafting skills to get them past the Gauntlet, a particularly dangerous stretch of river. The rest of the film tells of the family's efforts to thwart the robbers and of how their shared danger helps to mend the relationship between Gail and Tom. The film marked something of a new departure for Meryl Streep, previously often seen as a rather serious, cerebral actress. Although she had made occasional ventures into comedy, in films like "She-Devil" and "Death Becomes Her", this was her first appearance as an action heroine. It is not the sort of role which she has reprised since 1994, but she makes the most of it here; she even, apparently, performed most of her own stunts. David Strathairn, more often seen in supporting roles, here achieves leading man status as Tom. There is also a good performance from Kevin Bacon, generally a reliable villain, as Wade, at first friendly and plausible, later a raging psychopath. (John C. Reilly's Terry seems almost likable by comparison). Curtis Hanson is not a particularly prolific director; in a career lasting nearly forty years he has only made fourteen films. Some of those, however, especially in the thriller genre, have been good ones, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" and the excellent neo-noir "L.A. Confidential". "The River Wild" is another example of Hanson at his best, even though there are occasional implausible moments; some of the characters- especially Tom, the bespectacled, nerdish-looking architect- occasionally perform feats of strength or agility more often seen in superhero movies. The basic story- family menaced by violent criminals- may be an over-familiar one, but it is certainly handled in an exciting manner here. Curtis's direction is brilliant; this is one thriller that is genuinely worthy of the name, moving along at a cracking pace. The scenes on the river, especially when Gail is taking the raft down the Gauntlet, are heart-stopping. The cinematography of the beautiful wild scenery of the Pacific North-West is magnificent. "The River Wild" must count as one of the best-made thrillers of the nineties. 8/10

    Gail (Meryl Streep) is a white water rafting guide. She, husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazello) are kidnapped by robbers Wade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry (John C Reilly), who see rafting down the river as an effective escape route. It's pretty easy to understand the casting decisions for Bacon, Reilly and Strathairn, but Streep isn't the most obvious choice for action Mom Gail. Yet, as usual, she is superb (as is everyone else). The underlying marital problems give her a great deal to get her teeth into, but she also excels as the woman called upon to be a protective mother, a defiant hostage and someone on whose expertise on the river everyone's survival depends. Bacon is gloriously evil, a happy-go-lucky psychopath who is always a credible threat. And the action is terrific - lots of it, spectacular, beautiful, and clearly involving the actors a lot of the time, it makes this film a most enjoyable roller coaster ride (or white water rafting ride, I should say), and a movie which should have a higher profile than it has.

    A different role for Meryl Streep, as a former river guide with domestic problems. Her husband is always at work and their marriage is on the rocks. She decides to take a trip with her young son down the safe part of a river. At the starting point she meets three men; Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly are the two main protagonists. They claim to be on a fishing trip and off the merry threesome go on their way. Her husband shows up unexpectedly; played perfectly by David Strathairn. A short time later, the family meet up with Bacon and Reilly, who claim that the third guy had to leave because of an emergency. All is well at first, but the good times turn bad rather quickly, as the two buddies are revealed as criminal types who have committed a robbery and are on the run, and need Streep's expertise to make it through a treacherous pass on the river. The water and its' surroundings are beautiful, and an awesome Yellow Lab ads to a great cast. The story becomes a bit far fetched, but hey, just sit back and watch Meryl having a ball as she navigates a raft down the river.

    There is a sub-genre of the romantic comedy known as the "comedy of remarriage". Such films generally deal with a divorced or estranged couple, or a couple whose marriage has been going through a difficult patch, rediscovering their love for one another. They were especially popular in the thirties and forties, but there have been a number of recent examples such as "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" "The River Wild" can be seen as a "thriller of remarriage". Like "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" it deals with a big-city couple whose marriage is in trouble but who manage to save it while on a trip to a rural part of the American West. The difference between the two films, apart from the fact that the motive for that trip is quite different in each case, is that "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" tells its story in the form of a comedy, "The River Wild" in the form of a serious thriller. Tom and Gail, a middle-class Boston couple, are having marital problems. Gail, a teacher of deaf children, feels that Tom, an architect, spends too much time at work and neglects his family. Gail is originally from Idaho, and decides to take her young children Roarke and Willa on holiday to see her parents, who still live in that state. Gail is also an expert at whitewater rafting, and before her move to Boston worked as a rafting guide on a local river. (The "river wild" of the title; the film-makers may have chosen this unconventional word order to avoid confusion with "Wild River", the 1960 film directed by Elia Kazan). She decides to take Roarke on a holiday rafting trip down the river, Willa (who stays with her grandparents) presumably being too young to come along. At the last minute Tom joins them, and the three set off on their trip together. Near the beginning of their trip, the family meet two other rafters, Wade and Terry. At first the two men appear to be friendly, but Gail slowly becomes suspicious of them, and she and Tom decide to leave them behind. The attempt fails, and Wade pulls a gun on them. It transpires that the two men are criminals who have just committed a robbery and are using the river as a means of escape; they need Gail's rafting skills to get them past the Gauntlet, a particularly dangerous stretch of river. The rest of the film tells of the family's efforts to thwart the robbers and of how their shared danger helps to mend the relationship between Gail and Tom. The film marked something of a new departure for Meryl Streep, previously often seen as a rather serious, cerebral actress. Although she had made occasional ventures into comedy, in films like "She-Devil" and "Death Becomes Her", this was her first appearance as an action heroine. It is not the sort of role which she has reprised since 1994, but she makes the most of it here; she even, apparently, performed most of her own stunts. David Strathairn, more often seen in supporting roles, here achieves leading man status as Tom. There is also a good performance from Kevin Bacon, generally a reliable villain, as Wade, at first friendly and plausible, later a raging psychopath. (John C. Reilly's Terry seems almost likable by comparison). Curtis Hanson is not a particularly prolific director; in a career lasting nearly forty years he has only made fourteen films. Some of those, however, especially in the thriller genre, have been good ones, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" and the excellent neo-noir "L.A. Confidential". "The River Wild" is another example of Hanson at his best, even though there are occasional implausible moments; some of the characters- especially Tom, the bespectacled, nerdish-looking architect- occasionally perform feats of strength or agility more often seen in superhero movies. The basic story- family menaced by violent criminals- may be an over-familiar one, but it is certainly handled in an exciting manner here. Curtis's direction is brilliant; this is one thriller that is genuinely worthy of the name, moving along at a cracking pace. The scenes on the river, especially when Gail is taking the raft down the Gauntlet, are heart-stopping. The cinematography of the beautiful wild scenery of the Pacific North-West is magnificent. "The River Wild" must count as one of the best-made thrillers of the nineties. 8/10

    Gail (Meryl Streep) is a white water rafting guide. She, husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazello) are kidnapped by robbers Wade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry (John C Reilly), who see rafting down the river as an effective escape route. It's pretty easy to understand the casting decisions for Bacon, Reilly and Strathairn, but Streep isn't the most obvious choice for action Mom Gail. Yet, as usual, she is superb (as is everyone else). The underlying marital problems give her a great deal to get her teeth into, but she also excels as the woman called upon to be a protective mother, a defiant hostage and someone on whose expertise on the river everyone's survival depends. Bacon is gloriously evil, a happy-go-lucky psychopath who is always a credible threat. And the action is terrific - lots of it, spectacular, beautiful, and clearly involving the actors a lot of the time, it makes this film a most enjoyable roller coaster ride (or white water rafting ride, I should say), and a movie which should have a higher profile than it has.

    A different role for Meryl Streep, as a former river guide with domestic problems. Her husband is always at work and their marriage is on the rocks. She decides to take a trip with her young son down the safe part of a river. At the starting point she meets three men; Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly are the two main protagonists. They claim to be on a fishing trip and off the merry threesome go on their way. Her husband shows up unexpectedly; played perfectly by David Strathairn. A short time later, the family meet up with Bacon and Reilly, who claim that the third guy had to leave because of an emergency. All is well at first, but the good times turn bad rather quickly, as the two buddies are revealed as criminal types who have committed a robbery and are on the run, and need Streep's expertise to make it through a treacherous pass on the river. The water and its' surroundings are beautiful, and an awesome Yellow Lab ads to a great cast. The story becomes a bit far fetched, but hey, just sit back and watch Meryl having a ball as she navigates a raft down the river.

    Gail is a professional at water rafting. She twigs every day, and she is in a very good shape. She takes her family, one day, to a rafting trip down the river, but she has no idea that the planned trip is about to become a nightmare. Two escaping robbers with a handgun, meet the family in the way, and join them to the trip. Only later Gail realises that their new friends are dangerous criminals, but it's too late. The two men force them to stay together, and to keep cruising down the river. The family's life are risked not only by the two men, but also by the river which becomes more stormy and wilder.... Thefirst thing that you notice about this movie is that it's the first time since 'Aliens' that a woman has taken the lead in a Hollywood action movie. Streep is an odd choice, but as the heroine, she really brings a vulnerability to her character which makes her wholly believable. The story isn't up to much, but thanks to such good direction and brilliant rapid sequences, this becomes more than an average thriller. Bacon is as sinister as needed, but he too has his vulnerable side. Sub plots involving marriage break ups and Benjamin Bratt are an added bonus, and Joseph Mazello proves he wasn't a one trick pony in Jurassic park, he's just as annoying in this. It's a shame it's not a well remembered movie, because it is a thrilling movie with some wonderful performances.

    Gail (Meryl Streep), brings her workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke along on a white river rafting trip for a bit of family bonding and partially to salvage what's left of her declining marriage. The family vacation turns awry however, when they stumble across two mysterious strangers (Kevin Bacon & John C Reilly) who are in need of help as, so they claim, they are stuck in the middle of nowhere and need Gail to help them get out. Gail previously having worked as a guide on the river agrees. This is their story which differs somewhat to the actual truth as to what they are up to and soon husband Tom gets suspicious of the pair, as well he might! What follows is a roller-coaster ride of thrills, splashes, action and tension which successfully make this 90's action thriller a force to be reckoned with. It manages to keep the audience entertained and enthralled as Streep goes head to head with the two villains and of course the gushing river that cuts through the movie. The River Wild does what it says on the tin, all the while refraining from hiding behind any CGI effects, instead just using good old fashioned stunt work and great acting. Directed by Curtis Hanson who had previously directed 'The Hand That Rocked The Cradle', he uses his previous skill in pumping up the tension successfully and there are some great moments that make you wonder what is going to happen next. Meryl Streep is great as usual and plays the strong, level-headed female lead well, yet still with an air of vulnerability at the same time. Kevin Bacon is an excellent primary antagonist as Wade, along with his dumb partner in crime Terry. It's actually fun to watch as he uses his superficial charm to gain the trust of Gail and her family and then switching to a malevolent bad guy as soon as his motives are exposed. The scenes between Streep and Bacon are tense and dark which increases the pace even further. There are strong supporting characters too, including David Strathairn's serious yet underestimated husband role. Joseph Mazzello, from Jurassic Park fame, is Gail's son who puts in a good performance here. Benjamin Bratt also makes a small appearance as a guide on the river. John C Reilly appears in an early career role and has since had stronger roles in film. I have rated this film highly as it kept me entertained throughout. This is mainly due to the acting and direction which keep the pace going at break neck speed. Good old 90's action thriller.

    Curtis Hanson's box office hit 'The River Wild' is well-shot and even gripping in parts, but what really stands tall in this thriller and balances the film even when it dips, are the performances by it's talented star-cast. The story involves a family on a whitewater rafting trip, who encounter two violent criminals in the wilderness. 'The River Wild', which has been written by Denis O'Neill, offers some gripping moments, that truly manage to hold your attention. The characters, are nicely presented and executed. But, I would like to point out, that, the writing in the latter hour tends to drag a bit. The film surely could've been shorter by at least 10-15 minutes. And I believe if it had been trimmed, it's impact would have only enhanced. Curtis Hanson's direction, like always, is efficient. Cinematography is Striking. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: Meryl Streep is superb, as expected. She carries the film on her shoulders and delivers with ease in each and every scene. Kevin Bacon makes a really interesting bad guy, and proves his potential as an actor. David Strathaim is first-rate. John C. Reilly is good. Joseph Mazzello supports well. On the whole, A decent one-time watch, that offers strong performances to sail it safe.

    In Meryl Streep's astonishingly awards-packing filmography, this film has no chance to be singled out (not even among top 20 maybe), it actually botched the chance of Meryl's Oscar nomination that year (after a surprisingly gratifying Golden Globe nomination), I think it is its skin-deep kernel and the entertainment-first priority sabotaged it, if only speaking of the cast, Meryl's acting is completely Oscar-worthy. From A to Z, this intense adventure thriller holds one's breath tight with its suspenseful aura and splendid river torrent scenes, however the throwaway adrenalin-thrusting doesn't guarantee the same amount aftertaste, there are a touch indelible plot-holes emerging into my mind, which I assure you it is not a pleasant feeling (still, it's much better than most annoying pop-corn movies which I cannot even fluently commit myself to the moment). Meryl proves once again that she is the most versatile actress if not in the world, at least in Hollywood. The sports/action area is a rare attempt, yet she did most of her stunts, which is surely not able to be learnt from acting classes I suppose. With respect to the fore-mentioned skin-deep kernel, I have a hunch that both feminist and non-feminist would feel offended on account of in one hand the female protagonist's tough prevalence over her husband would exasperate man's ego, in the other hand, the inward- for-no-reason husband eventually resurrected his role-model father/husband image would be too obvious to feel empathetic (especially after a ludicrous rescue ploy). Poor David Strathairn, he had tried his best to save this badly-designed character. As for poor Kevin Bacon, he has been vying for an Oscar nomination since then, still in vain. (I would have taken Susan Sarandon's nomination for THE CLIENT to Meryl and also given one to the viciously- charming Kevin Bacon).

    I'll grant that the last 15 minutes or so of "The River Wild" are a pretty exciting and suspenseful white water rafting adventure. The unfortunate thing about it is that these are only the last 15 minutes or so. Up to that point what we have is a pretty slow moving river journey, with the added complication, of course, being that the troubled family on the trip finds more trouble as they pick up a couple of guys who robbed the local cattle auction. In the end the movie turns out to be pretty formulaic, with movements and plot points that we've definitely seen before - many times, in fact. Meryl Streep was an interesting choice as Gail - mother and white water guide - and while she was interesting (basically because this isn't what you'd think of as a normal Meryl Streep role) I didn't find her convincing in the part, either (which is probably why it's not a normal Meryl Streep role!) Kevin Bacon was somewhat more credible as Wade, the guy apparently in charge of the robbery, who decides to take the family hostage in order to use Gail's rafting expertise to run a particularly deadly river in the hopes of escaping the law. Along for the ride were David Strathairn as Gail's husband, John C. Reilly as Wade's sidekick and Joseph Mazzello as young Roarke, Gail's son. It's a decent enough cast. The story isn't especially original, though, and I just didn't find the movie to be all that exciting. Watching a rafting trip (which is essentially what we do for the bulk of this movie) with a few bits of drama thrown in as we become gradually more suspicious of the two strangers doesn't exactly make for a gripping two hours of viewing. There is, of course, the requisite ending as it seems that all the family's troubles are solved by having gone through this adventure together. (3/10)

    This is a good drama, set to nice scenery and enough action to keep it afloat on a "river Wild" of course. Three bandidos (sounds cooler than bandits, so I'll say it) are on this "river wild", as are a man, his wife, and their son. Issues arise between the couple, and when the two groups meet, one of the bandidos is dead, and the husband becomes weakened, which of course you know, because Meryl Streep has to be the star. This is all leading up to a final confrontation with the psychopath played by Kevin Bacon. So what makes this interesting is the wild card. The accomplice, played by Reilly, is not any of the stereotypes we are used to seeing. He is not the sicko, killer, maniac, or complete low life. Neither is he the good hearted kid who means well. He is the one we don't know throughout the movie, and that plays a key role in its ending. It ends with a decision that must be made by Meryl Streep, when she has one bullet for two men. One with the physical force and power of the knife. The other with the mental control. It becomes a throwback to the bad guys from "Rope" in a way. Does she make the right decision? Does she miss completely? I won't spoil that.

    Gail (Meryl Streep), brings her workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke along on a white river rafting trip for a bit of family bonding and partially to salvage what's left of her declining marriage. The family vacation turns awry however, when they stumble across two mysterious strangers (Kevin Bacon & John C Reilly) who are in need of help as, so they claim, they are stuck in the middle of nowhere and need Gail to help them get out. Gail previously having worked as a guide on the river agrees.

Joseph Mazzello, from Jurassic Park fame, is Gail's son who puts in a good performance here. Benjamin Bratt also makes a small appearance as a guide on the river.

    Curtis Hanson's box office hit 'The River Wild' is well-shot and even gripping in parts, but what really stands tall in this thriller and balances the film even when it dips, are the performances by it's talented star-cast. The story involves a family on a whitewater rafting trip, who encounter two violent criminals in the wilderness. 'The River Wild', which has been written by Denis O'Neill, offers some gripping moments, that truly manage to hold your attention. The characters, are nicely presented and executed. But, I would like to point out, that, the writing in the latter hour tends to drag a bit. The film surely could've been shorter by at least 10-15 minutes. And I believe if it had been trimmed, it's impact would have only enhanced. Curtis Hanson's direction, like always, is efficient. Cinematography is Striking. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: Meryl Streep is superb, as expected. She carries the film on her shoulders and delivers with ease in each and every scene. Kevin Bacon makes a really interesting bad guy, and proves his potential as an actor. David Strathaim is first-rate. John C. Reilly is good. Joseph Mazzello supports well. On the whole, A decent one-time watch, that offers strong performances to sail it safe.

    In Meryl Streep's astonishingly awards-packing filmography, this film has no chance to be singled out (not even among top 20 maybe), it actually botched the chance of Meryl's Oscar nomination that year (after a surprisingly gratifying Golden Globe nomination), I think it is its skin-deep kernel and the entertainment-first priority sabotaged it, if only speaking of the cast, Meryl's acting is completely Oscar-worthy. From A to Z, this intense adventure thriller holds one's breath tight with its suspenseful aura and splendid river torrent scenes, however the throwaway adrenalin-thrusting doesn't guarantee the same amount aftertaste, there are a touch indelible plot-holes emerging into my mind, which I assure you it is not a pleasant feeling (still, it's much better than most annoying pop-corn movies which I cannot even fluently commit myself to the moment). Meryl proves once again that she is the most versatile actress if not in the world, at least in Hollywood. The sports/action area is a rare attempt, yet she did most of her stunts, which is surely not able to be learnt from acting classes I suppose. With respect to the fore-mentioned skin-deep kernel, I have a hunch that both feminist and non-feminist would feel offended on account of in one hand the female protagonist's tough prevalence over her husband would exasperate man's ego, in the other hand, the inward- for-no-reason husband eventually resurrected his role-model father/husband image would be too obvious to feel empathetic (especially after a ludicrous rescue ploy). Poor David Strathairn, he had tried his best to save this badly-designed character. As for poor Kevin Bacon, he has been vying for an Oscar nomination since then, still in vain. (I would have taken Susan Sarandon's nomination for THE CLIENT to Meryl and also given one to the viciously- charming Kevin Bacon).

    I'll grant that the last 15 minutes or so of "The River Wild" are a pretty exciting and suspenseful white water rafting adventure. The unfortunate thing about it is that these are only the last 15 minutes or so. Up to that point what we have is a pretty slow moving river journey, with the added complication, of course, being that the troubled family on the trip finds more trouble as they pick up a couple of guys who robbed the local cattle auction. In the end the movie turns out to be pretty formulaic, with movements and plot points that we've definitely seen before - many times, in fact. Meryl Streep was an interesting choice as Gail - mother and white water guide - and while she was interesting (basically because this isn't what you'd think of as a normal Meryl Streep role) I didn't find her convincing in the part, either (which is probably why it's not a normal Meryl Streep role!) Kevin Bacon was somewhat more credible as Wade, the guy apparently in charge of the robbery, who decides to take the family hostage in order to use Gail's rafting expertise to run a particularly deadly river in the hopes of escaping the law. Along for the ride were David Strathairn as Gail's husband, John C. Reilly as Wade's sidekick and Joseph Mazzello as young Roarke, Gail's son. It's a decent enough cast. The story isn't especially original, though, and I just didn't find the movie to be all that exciting. Watching a rafting trip (which is essentially what we do for the bulk of this movie) with a few bits of drama thrown in as we become gradually more suspicious of the two strangers doesn't exactly make for a gripping two hours of viewing. There is, of course, the requisite ending as it seems that all the family's troubles are solved by having gone through this adventure together. (3/10)

    This is a good drama, set to nice scenery and enough action to keep it afloat on a "river Wild" of course. Three bandidos (sounds cooler than bandits, so I'll say it) are on this "river wild", as are a man, his wife, and their son. Issues arise between the couple, and when the two groups meet, one of the bandidos is dead, and the husband becomes weakened, which of course you know, because Meryl Streep has to be the star. This is all leading up to a final confrontation with the psychopath played by Kevin Bacon. So what makes this interesting is the wild card. The accomplice, played by Reilly, is not any of the stereotypes we are used to seeing. He is not the sicko, killer, maniac, or complete low life. Neither is he the good hearted kid who means well. He is the one we don't know throughout the movie, and that plays a key role in its ending. It ends with a decision that must be made by Meryl Streep, when she has one bullet for two men. One with the physical force and power of the knife. The other with the mental control. It becomes a throwback to the bad guys from "Rope" in a way. Does she make the right decision? Does she miss completely? I won't spoil that.

    What To Say,LOVED IT! Kevin Bacon's Role Was Bit Of Creepy As For The Role Of A Villain. Meryl Steep- Pure Natural in The Movie. Extremely Non-Twisted And Easily Understandable. May not be such a great one for the once who can't afford to waste time listening to long dialogs.. Some Scenes Maybe Intense for people who can't watch psycho movies. Overall Great One. My Verdict: 8.6/10 Is It Okay To Watch While With Family? OK.

    Thriller of Remarriage

    There is a sub-genre of the romantic comedy known as the "comedy of remarriage". Such films generally deal with a divorced or estranged couple, or a couple whose marriage has been going through a difficult patch, rediscovering their love for one another. They were especially popular in the thirties and forties, but there have been a number of recent examples such as "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" "The River Wild" can be seen as a "thriller of remarriage". Like "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" it deals with a big-city couple whose marriage is in trouble but who manage to save it while on a trip to a rural part of the American West. The difference between the two films, apart from the fact that the motive for that trip is quite different in each case, is that "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" tells its story in the form of a comedy, "The River Wild" in the form of a serious thriller. Tom and Gail, a middle-class Boston couple, are having marital problems. Gail, a teacher of deaf children, feels that Tom, an architect, spends too much time at work and neglects his family. Gail is originally from Idaho, and decides to take her young children Roarke and Willa on holiday to see her parents, who still live in that state. Gail is also an expert at whitewater rafting, and before her move to Boston worked as a rafting guide on a local river. (The "river wild" of the title; the film-makers may have chosen this unconventional word order to avoid confusion with "Wild River", the 1960 film directed by Elia Kazan). She decides to take Roarke on a holiday rafting trip down the river, Willa (who stays with her grandparents) presumably being too young to come along. At the last minute Tom joins them, and the three set off on their trip together. Near the beginning of their trip, the family meet two other rafters, Wade and Terry. At first the two men appear to be friendly, but Gail slowly becomes suspicious of them, and she and Tom decide to leave them behind. The attempt fails, and Wade pulls a gun on them. It transpires that the two men are criminals who have just committed a robbery and are using the river as a means of escape; they need Gail's rafting skills to get them past the Gauntlet, a particularly dangerous stretch of river. The rest of the film tells of the family's efforts to thwart the robbers and of how their shared danger helps to mend the relationship between Gail and Tom. The film marked something of a new departure for Meryl Streep, previously often seen as a rather serious, cerebral actress. Although she had made occasional ventures into comedy, in films like "She-Devil" and "Death Becomes Her", this was her first appearance as an action heroine. It is not the sort of role which she has reprised since 1994, but she makes the most of it here; she even, apparently, performed most of her own stunts. David Strathairn, more often seen in supporting roles, here achieves leading man status as Tom. There is also a good performance from Kevin Bacon, generally a reliable villain, as Wade, at first friendly and plausible, later a raging psychopath. (John C. Reilly's Terry seems almost likable by comparison). Curtis Hanson is not a particularly prolific director; in a career lasting nearly forty years he has only made fourteen films. Some of those, however, especially in the thriller genre, have been good ones, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" and the excellent neo-noir "L.A. Confidential". "The River Wild" is another example of Hanson at his best, even though there are occasional implausible moments; some of the characters- especially Tom, the bespectacled, nerdish-looking architect- occasionally perform feats of strength or agility more often seen in superhero movies. The basic story- family menaced by violent criminals- may be an over-familiar one, but it is certainly handled in an exciting manner here. Curtis's direction is brilliant; this is one thriller that is genuinely worthy of the name, moving along at a cracking pace. The scenes on the river, especially when Gail is taking the raft down the Gauntlet, are heart-stopping. The cinematography of the beautiful wild scenery of the Pacific North-West is magnificent. "The River Wild" must count as one of the best-made thrillers of the nineties. 8/10

    Gail (Meryl Streep) is a white water rafting guide. She, husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazello) are kidnapped by robbers Wade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry (John C Reilly), who see rafting down the river as an effective escape route. It's pretty easy to understand the casting decisions for Bacon, Reilly and Strathairn, but Streep isn't the most obvious choice for action Mom Gail. Yet, as usual, she is superb (as is everyone else). The underlying marital problems give her a great deal to get her teeth into, but she also excels as the woman called upon to be a protective mother, a defiant hostage and someone on whose expertise on the river everyone's survival depends. Bacon is gloriously evil, a happy-go-lucky psychopath who is always a credible threat. And the action is terrific - lots of it, spectacular, beautiful, and clearly involving the actors a lot of the time, it makes this film a most enjoyable roller coaster ride (or white water rafting ride, I should say), and a movie which should have a higher profile than it has.

    A different role for Meryl Streep, as a former river guide with domestic problems. Her husband is always at work and their marriage is on the rocks. She decides to take a trip with her young son down the safe part of a river. At the starting point she meets three men; Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly are the two main protagonists. They claim to be on a fishing trip and off the merry threesome go on their way. Her husband shows up unexpectedly; played perfectly by David Strathairn. A short time later, the family meet up with Bacon and Reilly, who claim that the third guy had to leave because of an emergency. All is well at first, but the good times turn bad rather quickly, as the two buddies are revealed as criminal types who have committed a robbery and are on the run, and need Streep's expertise to make it through a treacherous pass on the river. The water and its' surroundings are beautiful, and an awesome Yellow Lab ads to a great cast. The story becomes a bit far fetched, but hey, just sit back and watch Meryl having a ball as she navigates a raft down the river.

    Gail is a professional at water rafting. She twigs every day, and she is in a very good shape. She takes her family, one day, to a rafting trip down the river, but she has no idea that the planned trip is about to become a nightmare. Two escaping robbers with a handgun, meet the family in the way, and join them to the trip. Only later Gail realises that their new friends are dangerous criminals, but it's too late. The two men force them to stay together, and to keep cruising down the river. The family's life are risked not only by the two men, but also by the river which becomes more stormy and wilder.... Thefirst thing that you notice about this movie is that it's the first time since 'Aliens' that a woman has taken the lead in a Hollywood action movie. Streep is an odd choice, but as the heroine, she really brings a vulnerability to her character which makes her wholly believable. The story isn't up to much, but thanks to such good direction and brilliant rapid sequences, this becomes more than an average thriller. Bacon is as sinister as needed, but he too has his vulnerable side. Sub plots involving marriage break ups and Benjamin Bratt are an added bonus, and Joseph Mazello proves he wasn't a one trick pony in Jurassic park, he's just as annoying in this. It's a shame it's not a well remembered movie, because it is a thrilling movie with some wonderful performances.

    Gail (Meryl Streep), brings her workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke along on a white river rafting trip for a bit of family bonding and partially to salvage what's left of her declining marriage. The family vacation turns awry however, when they stumble across two mysterious strangers (Kevin Bacon & John C Reilly) who are in need of help as, so they claim, they are stuck in the middle of nowhere and need Gail to help them get out. Gail previously having worked as a guide on the river agrees. This is their story which differs somewhat to the actual truth as to what they are up to and soon husband Tom gets suspicious of the pair, as well he might! What follows is a roller-coaster ride of thrills, splashes, action and tension which successfully make this 90's action thriller a force to be reckoned with. It manages to keep the audience entertained and enthralled as Streep goes head to head with the two villains and of course the gushing river that cuts through the movie. The River Wild does what it says on the tin, all the while refraining from hiding behind any CGI effects, instead just using good old fashioned stunt work and great acting. Directed by Curtis Hanson who had previously directed 'The Hand That Rocked The Cradle', he uses his previous skill in pumping up the tension successfully and there are some great moments that make you wonder what is going to happen next. Meryl Streep is great as usual and plays the strong, level-headed female lead well, yet still with an air of vulnerability at the same time. Kevin Bacon is an excellent primary antagonist as Wade, along with his dumb partner in crime Terry. It's actually fun to watch as he uses his superficial charm to gain the trust of Gail and her family and then switching to a malevolent bad guy as soon as his motives are exposed. The scenes between Streep and Bacon are tense and dark which increases the pace even further. There are strong supporting characters too, including David Strathairn's serious yet underestimated husband role. Joseph Mazzello, from Jurassic Park fame, is Gail's son who puts in a good performance here. Benjamin Bratt also makes a small appearance as a guide on the river. John C Reilly appears in an early career role and has since had stronger roles in film. I have rated this film highly as it kept me entertained throughout. This is mainly due to the acting and direction which keep the pace going at break neck speed. Good old 90's action thriller.

    There is a sub-genre of the romantic comedy known as the "comedy of remarriage". Such films generally deal with a divorced or estranged couple, or a couple whose marriage has been going through a difficult patch, rediscovering their love for one another. They were especially popular in the thirties and forties, but there have been a number of recent examples such as "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" "The River Wild" can be seen as a "thriller of remarriage". Like "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" it deals with a big-city couple whose marriage is in trouble but who manage to save it while on a trip to a rural part of the American West. The difference between the two films, apart from the fact that the motive for that trip is quite different in each case, is that "Did you Hear about the Morgans?" tells its story in the form of a comedy, "The River Wild" in the form of a serious thriller. Tom and Gail, a middle-class Boston couple, are having marital problems. Gail, a teacher of deaf children, feels that Tom, an architect, spends too much time at work and neglects his family. Gail is originally from Idaho, and decides to take her young children Roarke and Willa on holiday to see her parents, who still live in that state. Gail is also an expert at whitewater rafting, and before her move to Boston worked as a rafting guide on a local river. (The "river wild" of the title; the film-makers may have chosen this unconventional word order to avoid confusion with "Wild River", the 1960 film directed by Elia Kazan). She decides to take Roarke on a holiday rafting trip down the river, Willa (who stays with her grandparents) presumably being too young to come along. At the last minute Tom joins them, and the three set off on their trip together. Near the beginning of their trip, the family meet two other rafters, Wade and Terry. At first the two men appear to be friendly, but Gail slowly becomes suspicious of them, and she and Tom decide to leave them behind. The attempt fails, and Wade pulls a gun on them. It transpires that the two men are criminals who have just committed a robbery and are using the river as a means of escape; they need Gail's rafting skills to get them past the Gauntlet, a particularly dangerous stretch of river. The rest of the film tells of the family's efforts to thwart the robbers and of how their shared danger helps to mend the relationship between Gail and Tom. The film marked something of a new departure for Meryl Streep, previously often seen as a rather serious, cerebral actress. Although she had made occasional ventures into comedy, in films like "She-Devil" and "Death Becomes Her", this was her first appearance as an action heroine. It is not the sort of role which she has reprised since 1994, but she makes the most of it here; she even, apparently, performed most of her own stunts. David Strathairn, more often seen in supporting roles, here achieves leading man status as Tom. There is also a good performance from Kevin Bacon, generally a reliable villain, as Wade, at first friendly and plausible, later a raging psychopath. (John C.

Curtis's direction is brilliant; this is one thriller that is genuinely worthy of the name, moving along at a cracking pace. The scenes on the river, especially when Gail is taking the raft down the Gauntlet, are heart-stopping. The cinematography of the beautiful wild scenery of the Pacific North-West is magnificent. "The River Wild" must count as one of the best-made thrillers of the nineties. 8/10

    Gail (Meryl Streep) is a white water rafting guide. She, husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazello) are kidnapped by robbers Wade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry (John C Reilly), who see rafting down the river as an effective escape route. It's pretty easy to understand the casting decisions for Bacon, Reilly and Strathairn, but Streep isn't the most obvious choice for action Mom Gail. Yet, as usual, she is superb (as is everyone else). The underlying marital problems give her a great deal to get her teeth into, but she also excels as the woman called upon to be a protective mother, a defiant hostage and someone on whose expertise on the river everyone's survival depends. Bacon is gloriously evil, a happy-go-lucky psychopath who is always a credible threat. And the action is terrific - lots of it, spectacular, beautiful, and clearly involving the actors a lot of the time, it makes this film a most enjoyable roller coaster ride (or white water rafting ride, I should say), and a movie which should have a higher profile than it has.

    A different role for Meryl Streep, as a former river guide with domestic problems. Her husband is always at work and their marriage is on the rocks. She decides to take a trip with her young son down the safe part of a river. At the starting point she meets three men; Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly are the two main protagonists. They claim to be on a fishing trip and off the merry threesome go on their way. Her husband shows up unexpectedly; played perfectly by David Strathairn. A short time later, the family meet up with Bacon and Reilly, who claim that the third guy had to leave because of an emergency. All is well at first, but the good times turn bad rather quickly, as the two buddies are revealed as criminal types who have committed a robbery and are on the run, and need Streep's expertise to make it through a treacherous pass on the river. The water and its' surroundings are beautiful, and an awesome Yellow Lab ads to a great cast. The story becomes a bit far fetched, but hey, just sit back and watch Meryl having a ball as she navigates a raft down the river.

    Gail is a professional at water rafting. She twigs every day, and she is in a very good shape. She takes her family, one day, to a rafting trip down the river, but she has no idea that the planned trip is about to become a nightmare. Two escaping robbers with a handgun, meet the family in the way, and join them to the trip. Only later Gail realises that their new friends are dangerous criminals, but it's too late. The two men force them to stay together, and to keep cruising down the river. The family's life are risked not only by the two men, but also by the river which becomes more stormy and wilder.... Thefirst thing that you notice about this movie is that it's the first time since 'Aliens' that a woman has taken the lead in a Hollywood action movie. Streep is an odd choice, but as the heroine, she really brings a vulnerability to her character which makes her wholly believable. The story isn't up to much, but thanks to such good direction and brilliant rapid sequences, this becomes more than an average thriller. Bacon is as sinister as needed, but he too has his vulnerable side. Sub plots involving marriage break ups and Benjamin Bratt are an added bonus, and Joseph Mazello proves he wasn't a one trick pony in Jurassic park, he's just as annoying in this. It's a shame it's not a well remembered movie, because it is a thrilling movie with some wonderful performances.

    Gail (Meryl Streep), brings her workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke along on a white river rafting trip for a bit of family bonding and partially to salvage what's left of her declining marriage. The family vacation turns awry however, when they stumble across two mysterious strangers (Kevin Bacon & John C Reilly) who are in need of help as, so they claim, they are stuck in the middle of nowhere and need Gail to help them get out. Gail previously having worked as a guide on the river agrees. This is their story which differs somewhat to the actual truth as to what they are up to and soon husband Tom gets suspicious of the pair, as well he might! What follows is a roller-coaster ride of thrills, splashes, action and tension which successfully make this 90's action thriller a force to be reckoned with. It manages to keep the audience entertained and enthralled as Streep goes head to head with the two villains and of course the gushing river that cuts through the movie. The River Wild does what it says on the tin, all the while refraining from hiding behind any CGI effects, instead just using good old fashioned stunt work and great acting. Directed by Curtis Hanson who had previously directed 'The Hand That Rocked The Cradle', he uses his previous skill in pumping up the tension successfully and there are some great moments that make you wonder what is going to happen next. Meryl Streep is great as usual and plays the strong, level-headed female lead well, yet still with an air of vulnerability at the same time. Kevin Bacon is an excellent primary antagonist as Wade, along with his dumb partner in crime Terry. It's actually fun to watch as he uses his superficial charm to gain the trust of Gail and her family and then switching to a malevolent bad guy as soon as his motives are exposed. The scenes between Streep and Bacon are tense and dark which increases the pace even further. There are strong supporting characters too, including David Strathairn's serious yet underestimated husband role. Joseph Mazzello, from Jurassic Park fame, is Gail's son who puts in a good performance here. Benjamin Bratt also makes a small appearance as a guide on the river. John C Reilly appears in an early career role and has since had stronger roles in film. I have rated this film highly as it kept me entertained throughout. This is mainly due to the acting and direction which keep the pace going at break neck speed. Good old 90's action thriller.

    Curtis Hanson's box office hit 'The River Wild' is well-shot and even gripping in parts, but what really stands tall in this thriller and balances the film even when it dips, are the performances by it's talented star-cast. The story involves a family on a whitewater rafting trip, who encounter two violent criminals in the wilderness. 'The River Wild', which has been written by Denis O'Neill, offers some gripping moments, that truly manage to hold your attention. The characters, are nicely presented and executed. But, I would like to point out, that, the writing in the latter hour tends to drag a bit. The film surely could've been shorter by at least 10-15 minutes. And I believe if it had been trimmed, it's impact would have only enhanced. Curtis Hanson's direction, like always, is efficient. Cinematography is Striking. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: Meryl Streep is superb, as expected. She carries the film on her shoulders and delivers with ease in each and every scene. Kevin Bacon makes a really interesting bad guy, and proves his potential as an actor. David Strathaim is first-rate. John C. Reilly is good. Joseph Mazzello supports well. On the whole, A decent one-time watch, that offers strong performances to sail it safe.

    In Meryl Streep's astonishingly awards-packing filmography, this film has no chance to be singled out (not even among top 20 maybe), it actually botched the chance of Meryl's Oscar nomination that year (after a surprisingly gratifying Golden Globe nomination), I think it is its skin-deep kernel and the entertainment-first priority sabotaged it, if only speaking of the cast, Meryl's acting is completely Oscar-worthy. From A to Z, this intense adventure thriller holds one's breath tight with its suspenseful aura and splendid river torrent scenes, however the throwaway adrenalin-thrusting doesn't guarantee the same amount aftertaste, there are a touch indelible plot-holes emerging into my mind, which I assure you it is not a pleasant feeling (still, it's much better than most annoying pop-corn movies which I cannot even fluently commit myself to the moment). Meryl proves once again that she is the most versatile actress if not in the world, at least in Hollywood. The sports/action area is a rare attempt, yet she did most of her stunts, which is surely not able to be learnt from acting classes I suppose. With respect to the fore-mentioned skin-deep kernel, I have a hunch that both feminist and non-feminist would feel offended on account of in one hand the female protagonist's tough prevalence over her husband would exasperate man's ego, in the other hand, the inward- for-no-reason husband eventually resurrected his role-model father/husband image would be too obvious to feel empathetic (especially after a ludicrous rescue ploy). Poor David Strathairn, he had tried his best to save this badly-designed character. As for poor Kevin Bacon, he has been vying for an Oscar nomination since then, still in vain. (I would have taken Susan Sarandon's nomination for THE CLIENT to Meryl and also given one to the viciously- charming Kevin Bacon).

    I'll grant that the last 15 minutes or so of "The River Wild" are a pretty exciting and suspenseful white water rafting adventure. The unfortunate thing about it is that these are only the last 15 minutes or so. Up to that point what we have is a pretty slow moving river journey, with the added complication, of course, being that the troubled family on the trip finds more trouble as they pick up a couple of guys who robbed the local cattle auction. In the end the movie turns out to be pretty formulaic, with movements and plot points that we've definitely seen before - many times, in fact. Meryl Streep was an interesting choice as Gail - mother and white water guide - and while she was interesting (basically because this isn't what you'd think of as a normal Meryl Streep role) I didn't find her convincing in the part, either (which is probably why it's not a normal Meryl Streep role!) Kevin Bacon was somewhat more credible as Wade, the guy apparently in charge of the robbery, who decides to take the family hostage in order to use Gail's rafting expertise to run a particularly deadly river in the hopes of escaping the law. Along for the ride were David Strathairn as Gail's husband, John C. Reilly as Wade's sidekick and Joseph Mazzello as young Roarke, Gail's son. It's a decent enough cast. The story isn't especially original, though, and I just didn't find the movie to be all that exciting. Watching a rafting trip (which is essentially what we do for the bulk of this movie) with a few bits of drama thrown in as we become gradually more suspicious of the two strangers doesn't exactly make for a gripping two hours of viewing. There is, of course, the requisite ending as it seems that all the family's troubles are solved by having gone through this adventure together. (3/10)
