    I have never seen the movie until I got to Singapore, out of my homeland, China. In a country where lacks of the freedom of speech and press, it is greatly difficult to know something about the Tiananmen Incident in 1989. The movie makes it possible for me to know more details about the miserable event, also the scandal of Chinese Communist Party. I was shocked and I shed my tears after seeing it. It tells the truth and reacts the situation at that time. In the first part of the movie, it states the history of Tiananmen and from this angle, it started a true story, no, it is history! The Chinese government was quite evil and had no feeling of compassion at all. I am quite sad to see such a evil government to govern the great China. When I saw the scene of the blood, I was shocked and I cannot understand the reason why the army shot at the crowd of students without any weapons at all! When I saw a mother who lost the son in the incident, there was a greatly bitter feeling in my deep heart. I am so sympathetic to the mother who lost her son, and thousands of wives who lost their husbands and thousands of sons who lost their fathers! I, as a undergraduate student who studies abroad, should do something to avoid the same event happening and let more people know the truth!
