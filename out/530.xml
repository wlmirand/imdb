 <sinopse>
  Two British soldiers in India decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This adaptation of the famous short story by Rudyard Kipling tells the story of Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. They decide that the country is too small for them, so they head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right. Kipling is seen as a character that was there at the beginning, and at the end of this glorious tale.

    I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story. The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

    I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; I almost cried. It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons: 1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

    This film is high on my list of "Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing." The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb. Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous. The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un- cut big rubies that don't say "big rubies" so much as they say "boring red stones." Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

    THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved. It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads. Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle. THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time. Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor. Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film. Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India. I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

    Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, "The Ballad of Boh da Thone" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever. Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of "The Man Who Would Be King" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

    This, my friends, is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    Here is a most excellent adventure movie that takes us right to the edge, then again, and once more again while thrilling, and chilling us and then... leaving us to ponder human nature, life and how no two stories are alike. Every one watching this can identify with it because it has Universal principals like greed, wealth, power, love and finally the cost of it all if you do not reign it under control. What shocks the viewer is that this can happen and makes one wonder if they practice something similar in their own life? Without saying too much, opportunity presents itself to two lucky pals who aren't afraid to take a risk or two or three to make a gain. They think out of the box and that thinking creates a wholesome, one of a kind adventure that takes us to far away places, people, circumstances and then...? Definitely gets some treats...popcorn, candy and something to wash it all down with as you join these boys having all that they want, then more than they could dream of.... to finally realizing something beyond their wildest dreams and then.... then the rude awakening of it all...Please enjoy

In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

    This film is high on my list of "Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing." The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb. Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous. The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un- cut big rubies that don't say "big rubies" so much as they say "boring red stones." Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

    THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved. It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads. Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle. THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time. Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor. Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film. Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India. I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

    Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, "The Ballad of Boh da Thone" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever. Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of "The Man Who Would Be King" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

    This, my friends, is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    Here is a most excellent adventure movie that takes us right to the edge, then again, and once more again while thrilling, and chilling us and then... leaving us to ponder human nature, life and how no two stories are alike. Every one watching this can identify with it because it has Universal principals like greed, wealth, power, love and finally the cost of it all if you do not reign it under control. What shocks the viewer is that this can happen and makes one wonder if they practice something similar in their own life? Without saying too much, opportunity presents itself to two lucky pals who aren't afraid to take a risk or two or three to make a gain. They think out of the box and that thinking creates a wholesome, one of a kind adventure that takes us to far away places, people, circumstances and then...? Definitely gets some treats...popcorn, candy and something to wash it all down with as you join these boys having all that they want, then more than they could dream of.... to finally realizing something beyond their wildest dreams and then.... then the rude awakening of it all...Please enjoy

    I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story. The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

    I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; I almost cried. It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons: 1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time. Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor. Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film. Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India. I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

    Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, "The Ballad of Boh da Thone" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever. Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of "The Man Who Would Be King" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

    This, my friends, is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    Here is a most excellent adventure movie that takes us right to the edge, then again, and once more again while thrilling, and chilling us and then... leaving us to ponder human nature, life and how no two stories are alike. Every one watching this can identify with it because it has Universal principals like greed, wealth, power, love and finally the cost of it all if you do not reign it under control. What shocks the viewer is that this can happen and makes one wonder if they practice something similar in their own life? Without saying too much, opportunity presents itself to two lucky pals who aren't afraid to take a risk or two or three to make a gain. They think out of the box and that thinking creates a wholesome, one of a kind adventure that takes us to far away places, people, circumstances and then...? Definitely gets some treats...popcorn, candy and something to wash it all down with as you join these boys having all that they want, then more than they could dream of.... to finally realizing something beyond their wildest dreams and then.... then the rude awakening of it all...Please enjoy

    I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story. The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

    I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; I almost cried. It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons: 1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

    This film is high on my list of "Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing." The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb. Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous. The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un- cut big rubies that don't say "big rubies" so much as they say "boring red stones." Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

    THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved. It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads. Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle. THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly.

Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

    This, my friends, is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    Here is a most excellent adventure movie that takes us right to the edge, then again, and once more again while thrilling, and chilling us and then... leaving us to ponder human nature, life and how no two stories are alike. Every one watching this can identify with it because it has Universal principals like greed, wealth, power, love and finally the cost of it all if you do not reign it under control. What shocks the viewer is that this can happen and makes one wonder if they practice something similar in their own life? Without saying too much, opportunity presents itself to two lucky pals who aren't afraid to take a risk or two or three to make a gain. They think out of the box and that thinking creates a wholesome, one of a kind adventure that takes us to far away places, people, circumstances and then...? Definitely gets some treats...popcorn, candy and something to wash it all down with as you join these boys having all that they want, then more than they could dream of.... to finally realizing something beyond their wildest dreams and then.... then the rude awakening of it all...Please enjoy

    I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story. The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

    I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; I almost cried. It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons: 1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

    This film is high on my list of "Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing." The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb. Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous. The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un- cut big rubies that don't say "big rubies" so much as they say "boring red stones." Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

    THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved. It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads. Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle. THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time. Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor. Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film. Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India. I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

    Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, "The Ballad of Boh da Thone" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever. Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of "The Man Who Would Be King" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story. The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

    I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; I almost cried. It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons: 1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

    This film is high on my list of "Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing." The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb. Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous. The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un- cut big rubies that don't say "big rubies" so much as they say "boring red stones." Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

    THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved. It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads. Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle. THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time. Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor. Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film. Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India. I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

    Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, "The Ballad of Boh da Thone" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever. Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of "The Man Who Would Be King" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

    This, my friends, is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

    I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; I almost cried. It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons: 1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

    This film is high on my list of "Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing." The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb. Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous. The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un- cut big rubies that don't say "big rubies" so much as they say "boring red stones." Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

    THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved. It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads. Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle. THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time. Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor. Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film. Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India. I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

    Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, "The Ballad of Boh da Thone" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever. Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of "The Man Who Would Be King" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

    This, my friends, is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    Here is a most excellent adventure movie that takes us right to the edge, then again, and once more again while thrilling, and chilling us and then... leaving us to ponder human nature, life and how no two stories are alike. Every one watching this can identify with it because it has Universal principals like greed, wealth, power, love and finally the cost of it all if you do not reign it under control. What shocks the viewer is that this can happen and makes one wonder if they practice something similar in their own life? Without saying too much, opportunity presents itself to two lucky pals who aren't afraid to take a risk or two or three to make a gain. They think out of the box and that thinking creates a wholesome, one of a kind adventure that takes us to far away places, people, circumstances and then...? Definitely gets some treats...popcorn, candy and something to wash it all down with as you join these boys having all that they want, then more than they could dream of.... to finally realizing something beyond their wildest dreams and then.... then the rude awakening of it all...Please enjoy

    I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story. The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

    THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved. It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads. Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle. THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time. Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor. Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film. Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India. I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

    Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, "The Ballad of Boh da Thone" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever. Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of "The Man Who Would Be King" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

    This, my friends, is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    Here is a most excellent adventure movie that takes us right to the edge, then again, and once more again while thrilling, and chilling us and then... leaving us to ponder human nature, life and how no two stories are alike. Every one watching this can identify with it because it has Universal principals like greed, wealth, power, love and finally the cost of it all if you do not reign it under control. What shocks the viewer is that this can happen and makes one wonder if they practice something similar in their own life? Without saying too much, opportunity presents itself to two lucky pals who aren't afraid to take a risk or two or three to make a gain. They think out of the box and that thinking creates a wholesome, one of a kind adventure that takes us to far away places, people, circumstances and then...? Definitely gets some treats...popcorn, candy and something to wash it all down with as you join these boys having all that they want, then more than they could dream of.... to finally realizing something beyond their wildest dreams and then.... then the rude awakening of it all...Please enjoy

    I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story. The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

    I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; I almost cried. It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons: 1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

    This film is high on my list of "Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing." The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb. Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous. The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un- cut big rubies that don't say "big rubies" so much as they say "boring red stones." Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

    Ruyard Kipling's epic of splendor , spectacle and high adventure at the top of a legendary world. It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem, "The Ballad of Boh da Thone" that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery's favorite film character , though John Huston also considered Richard Burton) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine , though also was deemed Peter O'Toole) , two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling (Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay) who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending , he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan , a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess (Shakira Caine, this is the only feature film to co-star Michael Caine and wife) under High Priest Kafu Selim (Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance , when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever. Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo , Connery and Caine , they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of "The Man Who Would Be King" many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties, and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon, Utah, USA , Grande Mont&eacute;e, Mont-Blanc, Chamonix , France ,Atlas Mountains, Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate ; this site was used in Gladiator as the North-African arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as "Morocco's Hollywood" since many international productions - such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes - were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre . The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs .

    This, my friends, is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list, but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name, and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography, landscape, and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors, John Hutson, you might not believe that this film has all the glory, and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces, like the African Queen, but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers, that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own, but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other, and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive, especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though, is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance, cleverness, loyalty, trust, and most importantly friendship, are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    Here is a most excellent adventure movie that takes us right to the edge, then again, and once more again while thrilling, and chilling us and then... leaving us to ponder human nature, life and how no two stories are alike. Every one watching this can identify with it because it has Universal principals like greed, wealth, power, love and finally the cost of it all if you do not reign it under control. What shocks the viewer is that this can happen and makes one wonder if they practice something similar in their own life? Without saying too much, opportunity presents itself to two lucky pals who aren't afraid to take a risk or two or three to make a gain. They think out of the box and that thinking creates a wholesome, one of a kind adventure that takes us to far away places, people, circumstances and then...? Definitely gets some treats...popcorn, candy and something to wash it all down with as you join these boys having all that they want, then more than they could dream of.... to finally realizing something beyond their wildest dreams and then.... then the rude awakening of it all...Please enjoy

    I originally thought that this was a movie about Jesus, but it turned out that it was based on a Rudyard Kipling novel, which is just as good. Kipling is well known as the author of The Jungle Story (which I have not read) but he wrote many other books, this being one of them. Kipling grew up in India, where most of his books are based, and worked there as a journalist. Kipling appears at the beginning and the end of this movie, which brings some legitimacy to the story. The story is about two British Army sergeants who decide to cross the Hindu Kush and conquer Afghanistan. They meet up with Kipling at the beginning and their interaction with him demonstrate them as being quite sly and underhanded. This underhandedness is what they take over the mountains in Afghanistan however there is a lot of luck involved as well. Firstly they are saved in the Hindu Kush by an avalanche that enables them to continue on their journey. When they arrive at the first city they meet up with an Indian guide who is able to act as a translator, and when they are taken to the holy city, the priest finds a symbol on one of them that corresponds to a symbol carved on one of their stones. However, it is very clear that this movie is going to end badly for both of them. When one of them survives an arrow shot (namely because it hits a leather strap) they believe that he is a god and worship him as such. However, there is a catch. It quickly becomes clear that while he is a god (the son of Secunda, the name of Alexander the Great, who promised that his son will return to rule them) there are limits to his power, and the priesthood make this clear. Everything comes undone when he decides that he wants to marry one of the locals (a girl named Roxanne, after Alexander's love interest). Despite all of his rhetoric he is unable to convince the natives that it is his right to marry, and when Roxanne bites him, it becomes clear that he is not a god, and is thus executed. His companion manages to escape, and this is how the tale is returned to Kipling. I guess this story is a tragedy of those who go to seek power and in finding it, are encompassed by it. To us westerner's a king is a mortal (and was so when the book was written in the late 19th Century), but to the natives, he was a god. There is no playing god, especially around non-European cultures. Captain Cook found that out the hard way when he returned to Tahiti only to be killed by the people that originally worshiped him. The same happened here when he decided that he would overturn the natives' tradition and attempt to marry. It wasn't going to happen, and no amount of rhetoric is going to change that. As the bible says, 'what does it profit a man to gain the whole world only to lose his soul'.

    I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; I almost cried. It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons: 1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, Conqueror of M&eacute;xico, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure. The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafirist&aacute;n. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.

    This film is high on my list of "Movies I Was Looking Forward To, But Found Disappointing." The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb. Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous. The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un- cut big rubies that don't say "big rubies" so much as they say "boring red stones." Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project "The Red Badge of Courage"? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres? "Raiders of the Lost Ark," six years after "The Man Who Would Be King," achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. "Raiders" recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good. The crowd scenes are consistently good, especially one shot where Huston seems to have a couple of thousand people trudging along, forming an army.

    THE FILM: In the mid 1950's, John Huston picked up a copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King. Huston felt the story would make a great film. He approached both Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable for the lead roles, and they accepted. Unfortunately, due to Bogart's death in 1957, the project stalled. Interest was regained during the making of The Misfits, when Clark Gable expressed his desire to do the film. Unfortunately, due to Gable's death in 1961, the film was once again shelved. It would be brought up in conversation now and then, with names like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas attached. Nothing came of it, and the project was yet again shelved. Finally in 1973, during the making of The Mackintosh Man Huston approached Paul Newman about doing the film, with Robert Redford. Newman thought the film sounded excellent, but if the film was to be about British men, British actors should be cast. Newman mentioned Sean Connery and Michael Caine as possible leads. Huston thought the idea excellent, and immediately contacted the two. Both agreed, and the shooting commenced in Morocco. It would be the last large scale epic Huston would ever tackle. THE PLOT: Rudyard Kipling is the author of a newspaper in Victorian era India, and one night as he types the next day's paper, a figure in rags approaches him. It comes with great shock to him when he realizes that this is a man he had befriended years prior. Indeed, it is Peachy Carnahan, whom Kipling had met when Peachy stole his watch. Carnahan begins to tell the story of his adventures, with fellow rogue Daniel Dravot. Years earlier, they had the idea to walk to the mystical land of Kafiristan, where no man has been since Alexander. The idea was to make peace with the warring tribes, and set themselves up as kings. After many sidesteps, they reach their destination and kick their plan into action. After Dravot is hit with an arrow, blocked by an ammunition belt, the local populace think him a god. After a great coincidence, he becomes the ruler of the land, and people worship him. Unfortunately, Dravot begins to think himself an actual god... THE CRITICISM: If ever the phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is applicable, this is a shining example. This kind of epic, big budget swashbuckling adventure is distinctly old Hollywood, but also incredibly entertaining. The film balances drama with comedy, adventure and greed, and does it flawlessly. This film hits all the right buttons, and then even more. Caine and Connery have tremendous camaraderie and their friendship is one of the most believable of all time. Indeed, in their performances, they exude a remarkable charm and drama. Caine, as Peachy Carnahan is charming, dangerous and greedy, while the same can be said for Connery's Daniel Dravot. Those who know Connery only as James Bond will be in for a shock when they see this film. He proves that he can not only act, but act well. For those who know Caine as an old man, will be surprised to see that in his youth he was an excellent actor. Christopher Plummer, in the role of Kipling is absolutely excellent. He is the lens through which you observe the story. The many years, and drafts of the screenplay, definitely show. All of that time in pre-production result in a perfectly realized script, and film. The score, by Maurice Jarre can be too much at points, but is still quite moving, especially in the last scene. The cinematography is beautiful, although it might feel slightly old school at points, so is the film. Too many epics find that with a big budget, the film must be intense and brooding drama. As Huston realizes here, that is not the case at all. With a big budget, he manages to craft an excellent, drama that doesn't mind verging on the comic at points. This is but one of the many literary adaptations Huston would tackle throughout his long career. As is the case with almost all of those films, I have not read the source material. From my understanding Rudyard Kipling was an actual British writer, who at one point did live in India. I am once again bring light on Huston's direction. He brings a masterful touch to the proceedings, crafting what could even be considered satirical by some. The film comes together through his direction, and indeed I cannot think of many directors whose range extends as far as Huston. If there was ever a running theme throughout his films, it is greed. This is no exception. As I wrap up, I call attention to the last scene of the film. To those who have seen it, and those who haven't, I believe you might be able to sympathize with me when I call attention to the incredibly moving nature of the ending. The singing was an incredibly sad and fitting end to this, one of the greatest epics ever made. The Man Who Would Be King, 1975, Starring: Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer, Directed by John Huston, 9.5/10 (A) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston film.

This is a film for the ages, and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics, filmmakers, and audiences alike. 10 out of 10 stars, or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.

    Unfortunately, I did not. I personally hate most of the postings that go "why does anyone like this movie??!!" I understand that many people like this movie, but if you have not seen it, be aware that, though the movie is in English, you had better have your subtitles on to understand what is being said (HEAVY accents). Further, though the acting was not shabby, I guess I was not as impressed by the performances as many others were. I understand that most movies require a certain suspension of disbelief. However, this movie had SO MANY bizarre coincidences that I could not stomach it (avalanche scene, rationale for not wanting a character to marry, and MANY actions of the priests). The cinematography was stunning at times, but the effect was often undone with loud and pretentious music in the background. I really cannot comprehend how this film got 4 Oscar nominations. Anyway, be aware that many others feel this movie was under-rated and under-recognized by the Academy. See it, and decide for yourself!

    The Man Who Would Be King is about two British soldiers in India who decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan--a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander. What else is this movie about? Let me tell you that right now. It's all about perfection, sheer perfection! The Man Who Would Be King is directed by John Huston, who directed classics like The Treasure Of Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston brings this movie to the level of 100% entertainment, no wait, he brings it to the level of masterpiece! This movie is indeed a masterpiece, it is outstanding, it ranks as one of Huston's best movies! This film proves that Huston was another one of those directors who even as he got older, never lost his ability to make great movies. What's to recommend? The acting, the score, the costume design, the scenery (the scenery is absolutely stunning), and many other things. The Man Who Would Be King is a big milestone in the filmography of John Huston, as well as a masterpiece that requires multiple viewings, no kidding, it does, when you watch it, you will be absolutely astonished! After his James Bond career ended, Sean Connery had more great films that he would star in, such as The Untouchables (which gave him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and not to mention the very film that I am commenting about, The Man Who Would Be King. Michael Caine also gives a great performance as Peachy Carnehan. In fact, Caine should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance, Connery should have been nominated for his performances as well. By the way, I really liked Michael Caine's British accent in this film. Christopher Plummer also co-stars in this movie as Rudyard Kipling, the man who wrote the very story that this movie is based on, and Plummer also deserves mention as he delivered a very good performance as well! But while Plummer and Connery were smashing in this movie, my biggest praise goes to Michael Caine. Caine was a scene stealer, every minute that he is on screen, you will be focusing your undivided attention on him. So all in all, The Man Who Would Be King marks another absolutely, totally, and completely smashing effort from that genius John Huston. Does this movie require a viewing? Or two viewings or three viewings? Or even more than that? Yes it does. When you watch this film, you will be astonished by what you will see. You will get a lot of things when you watch this film, such as thrills, laughs, action, and much, much, much, much more! I am not going to spoil anything in this movie for you, because this is a review, it is not a complete description of the plot. In short, this movie is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over and over again, because you will love it the very minute that you start watching it, because it is simply smashing, one of John Huston's best movies. When you watch this movie, get ready to see Sean Connery and Michael Caine at the top of their game, they deliver performances that are among the best of their entire film careers! So watch this film and enjoy it, because it's a great time! 10/10

    This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production. There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise. The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious. Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.

    Here is a most excellent adventure movie that takes us right to the edge, then again, and once more again while thrilling, and chilling us and then... leaving us to ponder human nature, life and how no two stories are alike. Every one watching this can identify with it because it has Universal principals like greed, wealth, power, love and finally the cost of it all if you do not reign it under control. What shocks the viewer is that this can happen and makes one wonder if they practice something similar in their own life? Without saying too much, opportunity presents itself to two lucky pals who aren't afraid to take a risk or two or three to make a gain. They think out of the box and that thinking creates a wholesome, one of a kind adventure that takes us to far away places, people, circumstances and then...? Definitely gets some treats...popcorn, candy and something to wash it all down with as you join these boys having all that they want, then more than they could dream of.... to finally realizing something beyond their wildest dreams and then.... then the rude awakening of it all...Please enjoy
