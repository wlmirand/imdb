 <sinopse>
  A young man's mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey. She gets sick and dies, at which time she comes back to life, killing and eating dogs, nurses, friends, and neighbors.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Lionel, a Mama's boy has the unwanted honor of having to look after his overbearingly evil mother. He ends up falling in love with a local woman who believes that they're destined together. In a moment of intentional sabotage of one of their dates, his mother is bitten by a mysterious creature that ends up zombifying her. It's only a matter of time before she rises from the dead a powerful, bloodthirsty zombie. It's only a matter of time before she starts infecting residents of the town and Lionel has to stop her...and them.

    I'm holding off giving this a top rating because of two flaws: # The crappy animations in some places, especially the rat-monkey at the beginning; # The rather plodding nature of the first half of the film. But, hey, I didn't expect the slash-tastic comedy gore fest that would ultimately ensue. It had me laughing my head off by the end, it was that good. One of the best comedy-horrors I've ever seen. Once things really got going the ideas kept coming thick and fast, one after another, delivering some absolutely amazing content and fabulous entertainment. Even the creepy uncle turned into an axe-wielding zombie bashing dude. I didn't really appreciate the humour element at first such as gluing mother's face back together so that she could keep up appearances in front of the visiting guild members, but once the line "I kick ass in the name of the Lord" was uttered I started to fully grasp the manic tongue-in-cheek element of it all. It must have been an absolute riot to film and be involved with. Thanks for making this film and sharing it with us, Peter Jackson.

    Forget about the relentlessly stale zombie movies of today and just watch this instead. My favorite thing about this movie(besides the hilariously over the top gore)is the pacing. Dead Alive kicks off the action almost immediately and rarely lets up, which makes it a roller coaster of gross-out antics and violent mayhem. It's also a tribute to Peter Jackson's skill as a director; Not long into the film and already you have a very likable cast and setting(which is somewhat rare in these types of movies). I wouldn't recommend this movie if you're squeamish, but if you enjoy(or at least can tolerate) loads of blood, guts, and some truly vomit-inducing moments, look no further.

    Without a doubt best gory flick ever made by one of the best cinematic master of our time Mr. Peter Jackson.Kudos to him for making a successful horror comedy which did not become just another sadist movie just like most of the zombie flicks today. First thing you do not need a Oscar winning writer for a zombie flick,it did not have although the great Mr.Jackson won some of that later still this movie has social satire fact and criticized our taste and our love for movies.But at the end of the day when its pleased you and if the violence stays on screen is not that the happiest place on earth?oh!that Disney.Whatever. If you are a zombie movie fan than this is the bible for you.Well it has everything-zombie + gore +bad acting + more gore+ a crappy origin story(better than resident evil series)+and more gore ...oh and did I mention how much gore it has?then stop reading this crap and go for it. k

    The first question that comes to my mind reviewing this movie is the reason why I saw it? I saw it for Peter Jackson, I was in total awe of his imagination and direction in the Lord of The Rings and to some extend King Kong too. He also did a very fine job with Heavenly creatures, so I was intrigued as to how such a prolific director would deal with the slasher genre. So, before writing any comment on the movie one thing that has to be taken into account is the fact that it was a pioneer in the Zombie movie genre and that is the only reason why this movie pulls off an otherwise loony, outrageous and over acted display of skills. This is probably just an experimental movie for Peter Jackson, I couldn't help noticing the Skull Island mention that also features in the King Kong. Why it's difficult for me to appreciate this movie now is because after films like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland the bar of Zombie genre movies has been set real high. Ten years ago this movie would have been just ideal a consideration for this genre but if you watch it today, well it's fun for the first half an hour but after that it's seems boring and useless. Though what I did appreciate was the Disgust factor which was something new specially since it was done with no holds barred. I am sure the cast and crew filled a whole lot of huge buckets with pukes while making this one. What works for the movie is the tag line and the name. It's quite clear in it's approach. This movie knows it's not meant to be taken seriously and asks you to leave your mind back home or be brain dead. Otherwise to me it had no charm whatsoever but after everything said and done still I would appreciate the effort since it was the avant-garde of Zombie slasher genre that has grown thanks to this effort. A 6/10 ...and watch it only if you are a real Zombie or Slasher movie lover.

    While spying on her son "Lionel Cosgrove" (Timothy Balme), who is on a date with a pretty woman named "Paquita Maria Sanchez" (Diana Penalver) at the zoo, "Vera Cosgrove (Elizabeth Moody) is bitten by a rare monkey. She then gets sick and dies. Unfortunately, she still isn't quite finished making life miserable for him. At any rate, rather than spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is not a film for those expecting a routine "zom-com" with some comedy and some gore thrown in for effect. Not in the least. It's a gore-fest that combines non-stop action with incredibly stupid scenes which seem to go on forever. Yet somewhere in the midst of it all there is a story thrown in as well. Now, unlike some people I am not a fan of movies that are "so bad it's good". And this film is no exception to the rule. Even though there were some parts which were funny, there were also quite a few other parts which were simply too juvenile and idiotic to get any enjoyment from. View at your own discretion.

    I loved Peter Jackson's earlier films over all that Lord Of The Rings stuff. I'm not saying their bad movies. On the contrary. Their just not my cup of tea. Peter's third pic here, he couldn't of got it better. With this one, he doesn't make you forget what he's capable of. That first schlock winner, the dreaded Bad Taste, followed by that bizarre, puppet borderline porn flick, Meet The Feebles, I loved. I hated The Frighteners, although I never saw Heavenly Creatures which was considered his best. This one, that hit the video shelves, two years after it's cinema release in Adelaide, he's outdone himself. He's just got better here. We have a simple and cute little plot, which paves the way for a lot of disgusting and despicably delightful gore. The last thirty minutes, is a constant full on horror show. A mama's boy, a nicey nicey type, meets a new town beauty, falls in love. The three go out. The mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat monkey. She comes back to life, an enraged zombie, devouring any human or animal, and we know what happens from here. So just sit back, and be horribly disgusted, while entertained by what follows, cause if you're a horror geek, and like it full bore, you're gonna love Braindead. It's a smartly done horror flick, it's catalyst interesting, from what erupts, one of the most overindulgent displays of gore, where more buckets of fake hemoglobin must of been used, for Kill Bill, Volume one. Peter, you're a fu..in' genius.

    I've always thought that Zombieland is the funniest zombie movie ever... that is until I watch Dead Alive today. Damn, this movie is hilarious and gory as hell. The movie was practically covered in red, blood blood blood everywhere. Truth be told, you won't learn anything useful from this movie nor would you spend time thinking about the different aspects of the movie after watching it but I'll have to admit that this is the best and funniest zombie movie ever produced and yea, it beats zombie movie series like Resident Evil and 28 days later. You will also be able to notice that the production team really puts in hell load of effort in making this movie by making loads of detailed effects of the dismembered zombie and MOM, LOL This is a no-brainer for fans of Zombieland and people who finds typical zombie movies boring.

    I've always had a soft spot for horror films. It's more than likely because they were some of the first movies I really fell in love with and were my entry into becoming a film buff. Although, I really do like serious horror films such as The Shining or A Nightmare on Elm Street, horror films that don't take themselves seriously like Evil Dead 2 or this film, Dead Alive, are the best ones. They stop trying to take a movie were a bunch of people die in sometimes completely ridiculous ways and instead make it into pure comedy. This movie does it so successfully. The movie already starts off with a great introduction scene with some ridiculous effects. The main plot of the film follows Lionel, played by Timothy Balme, and his very obsessive mother. Lionel meets Paquita, played by Diana Penalver, and she thinks they are romantically connected due to a fortune told by her grandmother. This doesn't really sound like much of a horror movie does it? Well, let's just say a rat monkey bites someone and everything breaks loose to put it in the simplest of terms. Things just go crazy. From a zombie baby being thrown around the park to a lawnmower being used to kill a ton of zombies. It is just ridiculous in the greatest way possible. The effects used in the movie are very fake looking but completely on purpose it adds to the humor level of the movie. The movie is filled with great overacting in some scenes which always plays into the horror comedy genre. Overall, if you just love comedy horror this is some of the best you can possibly get out of the genre. It is extremely enjoyable and filled with some of the most hilarious scenes in the genre possible.

    I first saw Dead Alive aka Brain Dead nearly nine years ago. I did not know Peter Jackson then, had no clue about the Lord of The Rings movies he had made. I brought this to show to my friends in engineering college on the recommendation of the CD shop owner who said that this was a terrific movie, very scary and full of thrills. Back then I had cursed him and his family members a lot after viewing the film. I had to stop the screening after 45 minutes as almost all the people had left. That was the only screening I was allowed to do during under graduation. I decided to see this again as I wanted to be through with Jackson's filmography as a director before watching The Hobbit. So I got a blue ray print and was very excited because of the great reviews and rating that this enjoys on various sites. This is the story of a rat monkey from Sumatra who bites people and infects them, turning them into zombies with flesh eating urges. I could watch this till the hour mark and then had to shut it down again. The bad special effects, the amateurish acting, the weird camera angles and the 'different' direction might be cup of tea for his legions of fan boys but they made for a very jarring movie watching experience. I understood that the movie is deliberately over the top like Evil Dead but it could not grip me at all. A few scenes were pretty hilarious but the overall sense remains the same that I could have done without watching this. 2 out of 5 for Jackson's Dead Alive. If being grossed out is what you like you will enjoy this tremendously. For others, this is a mandatory skip.

His ace humor sense with brutish bloodbath scenes was just heavenly hellsome epic :p I could never forget those extremely jocular flashes---zombie sauce, zombie injection, zombie dinner, zombie sex, zombie child, zombie light, zombie butcher :DDDD Entire cast had also the credit to adapt themselves perfectly with such ghastly-jolly plot :pppp Wish Peter would make such gruesome-funny film again after his Hobbit trilogy venture :p

His ace humor sense with brutish bloodbath scenes was just heavenly hellsome epic :p I could never forget those extremely jocular flashes---zombie sauce, zombie injection, zombie dinner, zombie sex, zombie child, zombie light, zombie butcher :DDDD Entire cast had also the credit to adapt themselves perfectly with such ghastly-jolly plot :pppp Wish Peter would make such gruesome-funny film again after his Hobbit trilogy venture :p

    I'm holding off giving this a top rating because of two flaws: # The crappy animations in some places, especially the rat-monkey at the beginning; # The rather plodding nature of the first half of the film. But, hey, I didn't expect the slash-tastic comedy gore fest that would ultimately ensue. It had me laughing my head off by the end, it was that good. One of the best comedy-horrors I've ever seen. Once things really got going the ideas kept coming thick and fast, one after another, delivering some absolutely amazing content and fabulous entertainment. Even the creepy uncle turned into an axe-wielding zombie bashing dude. I didn't really appreciate the humour element at first such as gluing mother's face back together so that she could keep up appearances in front of the visiting guild members, but once the line "I kick ass in the name of the Lord" was uttered I started to fully grasp the manic tongue-in-cheek element of it all. It must have been an absolute riot to film and be involved with. Thanks for making this film and sharing it with us, Peter Jackson.

    Forget about the relentlessly stale zombie movies of today and just watch this instead. My favorite thing about this movie(besides the hilariously over the top gore)is the pacing. Dead Alive kicks off the action almost immediately and rarely lets up, which makes it a roller coaster of gross-out antics and violent mayhem. It's also a tribute to Peter Jackson's skill as a director; Not long into the film and already you have a very likable cast and setting(which is somewhat rare in these types of movies). I wouldn't recommend this movie if you're squeamish, but if you enjoy(or at least can tolerate) loads of blood, guts, and some truly vomit-inducing moments, look no further.

    Without a doubt best gory flick ever made by one of the best cinematic master of our time Mr. Peter Jackson.Kudos to him for making a successful horror comedy which did not become just another sadist movie just like most of the zombie flicks today. First thing you do not need a Oscar winning writer for a zombie flick,it did not have although the great Mr.Jackson won some of that later still this movie has social satire fact and criticized our taste and our love for movies.But at the end of the day when its pleased you and if the violence stays on screen is not that the happiest place on earth?oh!that Disney.Whatever. If you are a zombie movie fan than this is the bible for you.Well it has everything-zombie + gore +bad acting + more gore+ a crappy origin story(better than resident evil series)+and more gore ...oh and did I mention how much gore it has?then stop reading this crap and go for it. k

    The first question that comes to my mind reviewing this movie is the reason why I saw it? I saw it for Peter Jackson, I was in total awe of his imagination and direction in the Lord of The Rings and to some extend King Kong too. He also did a very fine job with Heavenly creatures, so I was intrigued as to how such a prolific director would deal with the slasher genre. So, before writing any comment on the movie one thing that has to be taken into account is the fact that it was a pioneer in the Zombie movie genre and that is the only reason why this movie pulls off an otherwise loony, outrageous and over acted display of skills. This is probably just an experimental movie for Peter Jackson, I couldn't help noticing the Skull Island mention that also features in the King Kong. Why it's difficult for me to appreciate this movie now is because after films like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland the bar of Zombie genre movies has been set real high. Ten years ago this movie would have been just ideal a consideration for this genre but if you watch it today, well it's fun for the first half an hour but after that it's seems boring and useless. Though what I did appreciate was the Disgust factor which was something new specially since it was done with no holds barred. I am sure the cast and crew filled a whole lot of huge buckets with pukes while making this one. What works for the movie is the tag line and the name. It's quite clear in it's approach. This movie knows it's not meant to be taken seriously and asks you to leave your mind back home or be brain dead. Otherwise to me it had no charm whatsoever but after everything said and done still I would appreciate the effort since it was the avant-garde of Zombie slasher genre that has grown thanks to this effort. A 6/10 ...and watch it only if you are a real Zombie or Slasher movie lover.

    While spying on her son "Lionel Cosgrove" (Timothy Balme), who is on a date with a pretty woman named "Paquita Maria Sanchez" (Diana Penalver) at the zoo, "Vera Cosgrove (Elizabeth Moody) is bitten by a rare monkey. She then gets sick and dies. Unfortunately, she still isn't quite finished making life miserable for him. At any rate, rather than spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is not a film for those expecting a routine "zom-com" with some comedy and some gore thrown in for effect. Not in the least. It's a gore-fest that combines non-stop action with incredibly stupid scenes which seem to go on forever. Yet somewhere in the midst of it all there is a story thrown in as well. Now, unlike some people I am not a fan of movies that are "so bad it's good". And this film is no exception to the rule. Even though there were some parts which were funny, there were also quite a few other parts which were simply too juvenile and idiotic to get any enjoyment from. View at your own discretion.

    I loved Peter Jackson's earlier films over all that Lord Of The Rings stuff. I'm not saying their bad movies. On the contrary. Their just not my cup of tea. Peter's third pic here, he couldn't of got it better. With this one, he doesn't make you forget what he's capable of. That first schlock winner, the dreaded Bad Taste, followed by that bizarre, puppet borderline porn flick, Meet The Feebles, I loved. I hated The Frighteners, although I never saw Heavenly Creatures which was considered his best. This one, that hit the video shelves, two years after it's cinema release in Adelaide, he's outdone himself. He's just got better here. We have a simple and cute little plot, which paves the way for a lot of disgusting and despicably delightful gore. The last thirty minutes, is a constant full on horror show. A mama's boy, a nicey nicey type, meets a new town beauty, falls in love. The three go out. The mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat monkey. She comes back to life, an enraged zombie, devouring any human or animal, and we know what happens from here. So just sit back, and be horribly disgusted, while entertained by what follows, cause if you're a horror geek, and like it full bore, you're gonna love Braindead. It's a smartly done horror flick, it's catalyst interesting, from what erupts, one of the most overindulgent displays of gore, where more buckets of fake hemoglobin must of been used, for Kill Bill, Volume one. Peter, you're a fu..in' genius.

    I've always thought that Zombieland is the funniest zombie movie ever... that is until I watch Dead Alive today. Damn, this movie is hilarious and gory as hell. The movie was practically covered in red, blood blood blood everywhere. Truth be told, you won't learn anything useful from this movie nor would you spend time thinking about the different aspects of the movie after watching it but I'll have to admit that this is the best and funniest zombie movie ever produced and yea, it beats zombie movie series like Resident Evil and 28 days later. You will also be able to notice that the production team really puts in hell load of effort in making this movie by making loads of detailed effects of the dismembered zombie and MOM, LOL This is a no-brainer for fans of Zombieland and people who finds typical zombie movies boring.

    I've always had a soft spot for horror films. It's more than likely because they were some of the first movies I really fell in love with and were my entry into becoming a film buff. Although, I really do like serious horror films such as The Shining or A Nightmare on Elm Street, horror films that don't take themselves seriously like Evil Dead 2 or this film, Dead Alive, are the best ones. They stop trying to take a movie were a bunch of people die in sometimes completely ridiculous ways and instead make it into pure comedy. This movie does it so successfully. The movie already starts off with a great introduction scene with some ridiculous effects. The main plot of the film follows Lionel, played by Timothy Balme, and his very obsessive mother. Lionel meets Paquita, played by Diana Penalver, and she thinks they are romantically connected due to a fortune told by her grandmother. This doesn't really sound like much of a horror movie does it? Well, let's just say a rat monkey bites someone and everything breaks loose to put it in the simplest of terms. Things just go crazy. From a zombie baby being thrown around the park to a lawnmower being used to kill a ton of zombies. It is just ridiculous in the greatest way possible. The effects used in the movie are very fake looking but completely on purpose it adds to the humor level of the movie. The movie is filled with great overacting in some scenes which always plays into the horror comedy genre. Overall, if you just love comedy horror this is some of the best you can possibly get out of the genre. It is extremely enjoyable and filled with some of the most hilarious scenes in the genre possible.

    I first saw Dead Alive aka Brain Dead nearly nine years ago. I did not know Peter Jackson then, had no clue about the Lord of The Rings movies he had made. I brought this to show to my friends in engineering college on the recommendation of the CD shop owner who said that this was a terrific movie, very scary and full of thrills. Back then I had cursed him and his family members a lot after viewing the film. I had to stop the screening after 45 minutes as almost all the people had left. That was the only screening I was allowed to do during under graduation. I decided to see this again as I wanted to be through with Jackson's filmography as a director before watching The Hobbit. So I got a blue ray print and was very excited because of the great reviews and rating that this enjoys on various sites. This is the story of a rat monkey from Sumatra who bites people and infects them, turning them into zombies with flesh eating urges. I could watch this till the hour mark and then had to shut it down again. The bad special effects, the amateurish acting, the weird camera angles and the 'different' direction might be cup of tea for his legions of fan boys but they made for a very jarring movie watching experience. I understood that the movie is deliberately over the top like Evil Dead but it could not grip me at all. A few scenes were pretty hilarious but the overall sense remains the same that I could have done without watching this. 2 out of 5 for Jackson's Dead Alive. If being grossed out is what you like you will enjoy this tremendously. For others, this is a mandatory skip.

    Forget about the relentlessly stale zombie movies of today and just watch this instead. My favorite thing about this movie(besides the hilariously over the top gore)is the pacing. Dead Alive kicks off the action almost immediately and rarely lets up, which makes it a roller coaster of gross-out antics and violent mayhem. It's also a tribute to Peter Jackson's skill as a director; Not long into the film and already you have a very likable cast and setting(which is somewhat rare in these types of movies). I wouldn't recommend this movie if you're squeamish, but if you enjoy(or at least can tolerate) loads of blood, guts, and some truly vomit-inducing moments, look no further.

    Without a doubt best gory flick ever made by one of the best cinematic master of our time Mr. Peter Jackson.Kudos to him for making a successful horror comedy which did not become just another sadist movie just like most of the zombie flicks today. First thing you do not need a Oscar winning writer for a zombie flick,it did not have although the great Mr.Jackson won some of that later still this movie has social satire fact and criticized our taste and our love for movies.But at the end of the day when its pleased you and if the violence stays on screen is not that the happiest place on earth?oh!that Disney.Whatever. If you are a zombie movie fan than this is the bible for you.Well it has everything-zombie + gore +bad acting + more gore+ a crappy origin story(better than resident evil series)+and more gore ...oh and did I mention how much gore it has?then stop reading this crap and go for it. k

    The first question that comes to my mind reviewing this movie is the reason why I saw it? I saw it for Peter Jackson, I was in total awe of his imagination and direction in the Lord of The Rings and to some extend King Kong too. He also did a very fine job with Heavenly creatures, so I was intrigued as to how such a prolific director would deal with the slasher genre. So, before writing any comment on the movie one thing that has to be taken into account is the fact that it was a pioneer in the Zombie movie genre and that is the only reason why this movie pulls off an otherwise loony, outrageous and over acted display of skills. This is probably just an experimental movie for Peter Jackson, I couldn't help noticing the Skull Island mention that also features in the King Kong. Why it's difficult for me to appreciate this movie now is because after films like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland the bar of Zombie genre movies has been set real high. Ten years ago this movie would have been just ideal a consideration for this genre but if you watch it today, well it's fun for the first half an hour but after that it's seems boring and useless. Though what I did appreciate was the Disgust factor which was something new specially since it was done with no holds barred. I am sure the cast and crew filled a whole lot of huge buckets with pukes while making this one. What works for the movie is the tag line and the name. It's quite clear in it's approach. This movie knows it's not meant to be taken seriously and asks you to leave your mind back home or be brain dead. Otherwise to me it had no charm whatsoever but after everything said and done still I would appreciate the effort since it was the avant-garde of Zombie slasher genre that has grown thanks to this effort. A 6/10 ...and watch it only if you are a real Zombie or Slasher movie lover.

    While spying on her son "Lionel Cosgrove" (Timothy Balme), who is on a date with a pretty woman named "Paquita Maria Sanchez" (Diana Penalver) at the zoo, "Vera Cosgrove (Elizabeth Moody) is bitten by a rare monkey. She then gets sick and dies. Unfortunately, she still isn't quite finished making life miserable for him. At any rate, rather than spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is not a film for those expecting a routine "zom-com" with some comedy and some gore thrown in for effect. Not in the least. It's a gore-fest that combines non-stop action with incredibly stupid scenes which seem to go on forever. Yet somewhere in the midst of it all there is a story thrown in as well. Now, unlike some people I am not a fan of movies that are "so bad it's good". And this film is no exception to the rule. Even though there were some parts which were funny, there were also quite a few other parts which were simply too juvenile and idiotic to get any enjoyment from. View at your own discretion.

    I loved Peter Jackson's earlier films over all that Lord Of The Rings stuff. I'm not saying their bad movies. On the contrary. Their just not my cup of tea. Peter's third pic here, he couldn't of got it better. With this one, he doesn't make you forget what he's capable of. That first schlock winner, the dreaded Bad Taste, followed by that bizarre, puppet borderline porn flick, Meet The Feebles, I loved. I hated The Frighteners, although I never saw Heavenly Creatures which was considered his best. This one, that hit the video shelves, two years after it's cinema release in Adelaide, he's outdone himself. He's just got better here. We have a simple and cute little plot, which paves the way for a lot of disgusting and despicably delightful gore. The last thirty minutes, is a constant full on horror show. A mama's boy, a nicey nicey type, meets a new town beauty, falls in love. The three go out. The mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat monkey. She comes back to life, an enraged zombie, devouring any human or animal, and we know what happens from here. So just sit back, and be horribly disgusted, while entertained by what follows, cause if you're a horror geek, and like it full bore, you're gonna love Braindead. It's a smartly done horror flick, it's catalyst interesting, from what erupts, one of the most overindulgent displays of gore, where more buckets of fake hemoglobin must of been used, for Kill Bill, Volume one. Peter, you're a fu..in' genius.

    I've always thought that Zombieland is the funniest zombie movie ever... that is until I watch Dead Alive today. Damn, this movie is hilarious and gory as hell. The movie was practically covered in red, blood blood blood everywhere. Truth be told, you won't learn anything useful from this movie nor would you spend time thinking about the different aspects of the movie after watching it but I'll have to admit that this is the best and funniest zombie movie ever produced and yea, it beats zombie movie series like Resident Evil and 28 days later. You will also be able to notice that the production team really puts in hell load of effort in making this movie by making loads of detailed effects of the dismembered zombie and MOM, LOL This is a no-brainer for fans of Zombieland and people who finds typical zombie movies boring.

    I've always had a soft spot for horror films. It's more than likely because they were some of the first movies I really fell in love with and were my entry into becoming a film buff. Although, I really do like serious horror films such as The Shining or A Nightmare on Elm Street, horror films that don't take themselves seriously like Evil Dead 2 or this film, Dead Alive, are the best ones. They stop trying to take a movie were a bunch of people die in sometimes completely ridiculous ways and instead make it into pure comedy. This movie does it so successfully. The movie already starts off with a great introduction scene with some ridiculous effects. The main plot of the film follows Lionel, played by Timothy Balme, and his very obsessive mother. Lionel meets Paquita, played by Diana Penalver, and she thinks they are romantically connected due to a fortune told by her grandmother. This doesn't really sound like much of a horror movie does it? Well, let's just say a rat monkey bites someone and everything breaks loose to put it in the simplest of terms. Things just go crazy. From a zombie baby being thrown around the park to a lawnmower being used to kill a ton of zombies. It is just ridiculous in the greatest way possible. The effects used in the movie are very fake looking but completely on purpose it adds to the humor level of the movie. The movie is filled with great overacting in some scenes which always plays into the horror comedy genre. Overall, if you just love comedy horror this is some of the best you can possibly get out of the genre. It is extremely enjoyable and filled with some of the most hilarious scenes in the genre possible.

    I first saw Dead Alive aka Brain Dead nearly nine years ago. I did not know Peter Jackson then, had no clue about the Lord of The Rings movies he had made. I brought this to show to my friends in engineering college on the recommendation of the CD shop owner who said that this was a terrific movie, very scary and full of thrills. Back then I had cursed him and his family members a lot after viewing the film. I had to stop the screening after 45 minutes as almost all the people had left. That was the only screening I was allowed to do during under graduation. I decided to see this again as I wanted to be through with Jackson's filmography as a director before watching The Hobbit. So I got a blue ray print and was very excited because of the great reviews and rating that this enjoys on various sites. This is the story of a rat monkey from Sumatra who bites people and infects them, turning them into zombies with flesh eating urges. I could watch this till the hour mark and then had to shut it down again. The bad special effects, the amateurish acting, the weird camera angles and the 'different' direction might be cup of tea for his legions of fan boys but they made for a very jarring movie watching experience. I understood that the movie is deliberately over the top like Evil Dead but it could not grip me at all. A few scenes were pretty hilarious but the overall sense remains the same that I could have done without watching this. 2 out of 5 for Jackson's Dead Alive. If being grossed out is what you like you will enjoy this tremendously. For others, this is a mandatory skip.

His ace humor sense with brutish bloodbath scenes was just heavenly hellsome epic :p I could never forget those extremely jocular flashes---zombie sauce, zombie injection, zombie dinner, zombie sex, zombie child, zombie light, zombie butcher :DDDD Entire cast had also the credit to adapt themselves perfectly with such ghastly-jolly plot :pppp Wish Peter would make such gruesome-funny film again after his Hobbit trilogy venture :p

    I'm holding off giving this a top rating because of two flaws: # The crappy animations in some places, especially the rat-monkey at the beginning; # The rather plodding nature of the first half of the film. But, hey, I didn't expect the slash-tastic comedy gore fest that would ultimately ensue. It had me laughing my head off by the end, it was that good. One of the best comedy-horrors I've ever seen. Once things really got going the ideas kept coming thick and fast, one after another, delivering some absolutely amazing content and fabulous entertainment. Even the creepy uncle turned into an axe-wielding zombie bashing dude. I didn't really appreciate the humour element at first such as gluing mother's face back together so that she could keep up appearances in front of the visiting guild members, but once the line "I kick ass in the name of the Lord" was uttered I started to fully grasp the manic tongue-in-cheek element of it all. It must have been an absolute riot to film and be involved with. Thanks for making this film and sharing it with us, Peter Jackson.

If you are a zombie movie fan than this is the bible for you.Well it has everything-zombie + gore +bad acting + more gore+ a crappy origin story(better than resident evil series)+and more gore ...oh and did I mention how much gore it has?then stop reading this crap and go for it. k

    The first question that comes to my mind reviewing this movie is the reason why I saw it? I saw it for Peter Jackson, I was in total awe of his imagination and direction in the Lord of The Rings and to some extend King Kong too. He also did a very fine job with Heavenly creatures, so I was intrigued as to how such a prolific director would deal with the slasher genre. So, before writing any comment on the movie one thing that has to be taken into account is the fact that it was a pioneer in the Zombie movie genre and that is the only reason why this movie pulls off an otherwise loony, outrageous and over acted display of skills. This is probably just an experimental movie for Peter Jackson, I couldn't help noticing the Skull Island mention that also features in the King Kong. Why it's difficult for me to appreciate this movie now is because after films like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland the bar of Zombie genre movies has been set real high. Ten years ago this movie would have been just ideal a consideration for this genre but if you watch it today, well it's fun for the first half an hour but after that it's seems boring and useless. Though what I did appreciate was the Disgust factor which was something new specially since it was done with no holds barred. I am sure the cast and crew filled a whole lot of huge buckets with pukes while making this one. What works for the movie is the tag line and the name. It's quite clear in it's approach. This movie knows it's not meant to be taken seriously and asks you to leave your mind back home or be brain dead. Otherwise to me it had no charm whatsoever but after everything said and done still I would appreciate the effort since it was the avant-garde of Zombie slasher genre that has grown thanks to this effort. A 6/10 ...and watch it only if you are a real Zombie or Slasher movie lover.

    While spying on her son "Lionel Cosgrove" (Timothy Balme), who is on a date with a pretty woman named "Paquita Maria Sanchez" (Diana Penalver) at the zoo, "Vera Cosgrove (Elizabeth Moody) is bitten by a rare monkey. She then gets sick and dies. Unfortunately, she still isn't quite finished making life miserable for him. At any rate, rather than spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is not a film for those expecting a routine "zom-com" with some comedy and some gore thrown in for effect. Not in the least. It's a gore-fest that combines non-stop action with incredibly stupid scenes which seem to go on forever. Yet somewhere in the midst of it all there is a story thrown in as well. Now, unlike some people I am not a fan of movies that are "so bad it's good". And this film is no exception to the rule. Even though there were some parts which were funny, there were also quite a few other parts which were simply too juvenile and idiotic to get any enjoyment from. View at your own discretion.

    I loved Peter Jackson's earlier films over all that Lord Of The Rings stuff. I'm not saying their bad movies. On the contrary. Their just not my cup of tea. Peter's third pic here, he couldn't of got it better. With this one, he doesn't make you forget what he's capable of. That first schlock winner, the dreaded Bad Taste, followed by that bizarre, puppet borderline porn flick, Meet The Feebles, I loved. I hated The Frighteners, although I never saw Heavenly Creatures which was considered his best. This one, that hit the video shelves, two years after it's cinema release in Adelaide, he's outdone himself. He's just got better here. We have a simple and cute little plot, which paves the way for a lot of disgusting and despicably delightful gore. The last thirty minutes, is a constant full on horror show. A mama's boy, a nicey nicey type, meets a new town beauty, falls in love. The three go out. The mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat monkey. She comes back to life, an enraged zombie, devouring any human or animal, and we know what happens from here. So just sit back, and be horribly disgusted, while entertained by what follows, cause if you're a horror geek, and like it full bore, you're gonna love Braindead. It's a smartly done horror flick, it's catalyst interesting, from what erupts, one of the most overindulgent displays of gore, where more buckets of fake hemoglobin must of been used, for Kill Bill, Volume one. Peter, you're a fu..in' genius.

    I've always thought that Zombieland is the funniest zombie movie ever... that is until I watch Dead Alive today. Damn, this movie is hilarious and gory as hell. The movie was practically covered in red, blood blood blood everywhere. Truth be told, you won't learn anything useful from this movie nor would you spend time thinking about the different aspects of the movie after watching it but I'll have to admit that this is the best and funniest zombie movie ever produced and yea, it beats zombie movie series like Resident Evil and 28 days later. You will also be able to notice that the production team really puts in hell load of effort in making this movie by making loads of detailed effects of the dismembered zombie and MOM, LOL This is a no-brainer for fans of Zombieland and people who finds typical zombie movies boring.

    I've always had a soft spot for horror films. It's more than likely because they were some of the first movies I really fell in love with and were my entry into becoming a film buff. Although, I really do like serious horror films such as The Shining or A Nightmare on Elm Street, horror films that don't take themselves seriously like Evil Dead 2 or this film, Dead Alive, are the best ones. They stop trying to take a movie were a bunch of people die in sometimes completely ridiculous ways and instead make it into pure comedy. This movie does it so successfully. The movie already starts off with a great introduction scene with some ridiculous effects. The main plot of the film follows Lionel, played by Timothy Balme, and his very obsessive mother. Lionel meets Paquita, played by Diana Penalver, and she thinks they are romantically connected due to a fortune told by her grandmother. This doesn't really sound like much of a horror movie does it? Well, let's just say a rat monkey bites someone and everything breaks loose to put it in the simplest of terms. Things just go crazy. From a zombie baby being thrown around the park to a lawnmower being used to kill a ton of zombies. It is just ridiculous in the greatest way possible. The effects used in the movie are very fake looking but completely on purpose it adds to the humor level of the movie. The movie is filled with great overacting in some scenes which always plays into the horror comedy genre. Overall, if you just love comedy horror this is some of the best you can possibly get out of the genre. It is extremely enjoyable and filled with some of the most hilarious scenes in the genre possible.

    I first saw Dead Alive aka Brain Dead nearly nine years ago. I did not know Peter Jackson then, had no clue about the Lord of The Rings movies he had made. I brought this to show to my friends in engineering college on the recommendation of the CD shop owner who said that this was a terrific movie, very scary and full of thrills. Back then I had cursed him and his family members a lot after viewing the film. I had to stop the screening after 45 minutes as almost all the people had left. That was the only screening I was allowed to do during under graduation. I decided to see this again as I wanted to be through with Jackson's filmography as a director before watching The Hobbit. So I got a blue ray print and was very excited because of the great reviews and rating that this enjoys on various sites. This is the story of a rat monkey from Sumatra who bites people and infects them, turning them into zombies with flesh eating urges. I could watch this till the hour mark and then had to shut it down again. The bad special effects, the amateurish acting, the weird camera angles and the 'different' direction might be cup of tea for his legions of fan boys but they made for a very jarring movie watching experience. I understood that the movie is deliberately over the top like Evil Dead but it could not grip me at all. A few scenes were pretty hilarious but the overall sense remains the same that I could have done without watching this. 2 out of 5 for Jackson's Dead Alive. If being grossed out is what you like you will enjoy this tremendously. For others, this is a mandatory skip.

His ace humor sense with brutish bloodbath scenes was just heavenly hellsome epic :p I could never forget those extremely jocular flashes---zombie sauce, zombie injection, zombie dinner, zombie sex, zombie child, zombie light, zombie butcher :DDDD Entire cast had also the credit to adapt themselves perfectly with such ghastly-jolly plot :pppp Wish Peter would make such gruesome-funny film again after his Hobbit trilogy venture :p

    I'm holding off giving this a top rating because of two flaws: # The crappy animations in some places, especially the rat-monkey at the beginning; # The rather plodding nature of the first half of the film. But, hey, I didn't expect the slash-tastic comedy gore fest that would ultimately ensue. It had me laughing my head off by the end, it was that good. One of the best comedy-horrors I've ever seen. Once things really got going the ideas kept coming thick and fast, one after another, delivering some absolutely amazing content and fabulous entertainment. Even the creepy uncle turned into an axe-wielding zombie bashing dude. I didn't really appreciate the humour element at first such as gluing mother's face back together so that she could keep up appearances in front of the visiting guild members, but once the line "I kick ass in the name of the Lord" was uttered I started to fully grasp the manic tongue-in-cheek element of it all. It must have been an absolute riot to film and be involved with. Thanks for making this film and sharing it with us, Peter Jackson.

    Forget about the relentlessly stale zombie movies of today and just watch this instead. My favorite thing about this movie(besides the hilariously over the top gore)is the pacing. Dead Alive kicks off the action almost immediately and rarely lets up, which makes it a roller coaster of gross-out antics and violent mayhem. It's also a tribute to Peter Jackson's skill as a director; Not long into the film and already you have a very likable cast and setting(which is somewhat rare in these types of movies). I wouldn't recommend this movie if you're squeamish, but if you enjoy(or at least can tolerate) loads of blood, guts, and some truly vomit-inducing moments, look no further.

Why it's difficult for me to appreciate this movie now is because after films like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland the bar of Zombie genre movies has been set real high. Ten years ago this movie would have been just ideal a consideration for this genre but if you watch it today, well it's fun for the first half an hour but after that it's seems boring and useless. Though what I did appreciate was the Disgust factor which was something new specially since it was done with no holds barred. I am sure the cast and crew filled a whole lot of huge buckets with pukes while making this one. What works for the movie is the tag line and the name. It's quite clear in it's approach. This movie knows it's not meant to be taken seriously and asks you to leave your mind back home or be brain dead. Otherwise to me it had no charm whatsoever but after everything said and done still I would appreciate the effort since it was the avant-garde of Zombie slasher genre that has grown thanks to this effort. A 6/10 ...and watch it only if you are a real Zombie or Slasher movie lover.

    While spying on her son "Lionel Cosgrove" (Timothy Balme), who is on a date with a pretty woman named "Paquita Maria Sanchez" (Diana Penalver) at the zoo, "Vera Cosgrove (Elizabeth Moody) is bitten by a rare monkey. She then gets sick and dies. Unfortunately, she still isn't quite finished making life miserable for him. At any rate, rather than spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is not a film for those expecting a routine "zom-com" with some comedy and some gore thrown in for effect. Not in the least. It's a gore-fest that combines non-stop action with incredibly stupid scenes which seem to go on forever. Yet somewhere in the midst of it all there is a story thrown in as well. Now, unlike some people I am not a fan of movies that are "so bad it's good". And this film is no exception to the rule. Even though there were some parts which were funny, there were also quite a few other parts which were simply too juvenile and idiotic to get any enjoyment from. View at your own discretion.

    I loved Peter Jackson's earlier films over all that Lord Of The Rings stuff. I'm not saying their bad movies. On the contrary. Their just not my cup of tea. Peter's third pic here, he couldn't of got it better. With this one, he doesn't make you forget what he's capable of. That first schlock winner, the dreaded Bad Taste, followed by that bizarre, puppet borderline porn flick, Meet The Feebles, I loved. I hated The Frighteners, although I never saw Heavenly Creatures which was considered his best. This one, that hit the video shelves, two years after it's cinema release in Adelaide, he's outdone himself. He's just got better here. We have a simple and cute little plot, which paves the way for a lot of disgusting and despicably delightful gore. The last thirty minutes, is a constant full on horror show. A mama's boy, a nicey nicey type, meets a new town beauty, falls in love. The three go out. The mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat monkey. She comes back to life, an enraged zombie, devouring any human or animal, and we know what happens from here. So just sit back, and be horribly disgusted, while entertained by what follows, cause if you're a horror geek, and like it full bore, you're gonna love Braindead. It's a smartly done horror flick, it's catalyst interesting, from what erupts, one of the most overindulgent displays of gore, where more buckets of fake hemoglobin must of been used, for Kill Bill, Volume one. Peter, you're a fu..in' genius.

    I've always thought that Zombieland is the funniest zombie movie ever... that is until I watch Dead Alive today. Damn, this movie is hilarious and gory as hell. The movie was practically covered in red, blood blood blood everywhere. Truth be told, you won't learn anything useful from this movie nor would you spend time thinking about the different aspects of the movie after watching it but I'll have to admit that this is the best and funniest zombie movie ever produced and yea, it beats zombie movie series like Resident Evil and 28 days later. You will also be able to notice that the production team really puts in hell load of effort in making this movie by making loads of detailed effects of the dismembered zombie and MOM, LOL This is a no-brainer for fans of Zombieland and people who finds typical zombie movies boring.

    I've always had a soft spot for horror films. It's more than likely because they were some of the first movies I really fell in love with and were my entry into becoming a film buff. Although, I really do like serious horror films such as The Shining or A Nightmare on Elm Street, horror films that don't take themselves seriously like Evil Dead 2 or this film, Dead Alive, are the best ones. They stop trying to take a movie were a bunch of people die in sometimes completely ridiculous ways and instead make it into pure comedy. This movie does it so successfully. The movie already starts off with a great introduction scene with some ridiculous effects. The main plot of the film follows Lionel, played by Timothy Balme, and his very obsessive mother. Lionel meets Paquita, played by Diana Penalver, and she thinks they are romantically connected due to a fortune told by her grandmother. This doesn't really sound like much of a horror movie does it? Well, let's just say a rat monkey bites someone and everything breaks loose to put it in the simplest of terms. Things just go crazy. From a zombie baby being thrown around the park to a lawnmower being used to kill a ton of zombies. It is just ridiculous in the greatest way possible. The effects used in the movie are very fake looking but completely on purpose it adds to the humor level of the movie. The movie is filled with great overacting in some scenes which always plays into the horror comedy genre. Overall, if you just love comedy horror this is some of the best you can possibly get out of the genre. It is extremely enjoyable and filled with some of the most hilarious scenes in the genre possible.

    I first saw Dead Alive aka Brain Dead nearly nine years ago. I did not know Peter Jackson then, had no clue about the Lord of The Rings movies he had made. I brought this to show to my friends in engineering college on the recommendation of the CD shop owner who said that this was a terrific movie, very scary and full of thrills. Back then I had cursed him and his family members a lot after viewing the film. I had to stop the screening after 45 minutes as almost all the people had left. That was the only screening I was allowed to do during under graduation. I decided to see this again as I wanted to be through with Jackson's filmography as a director before watching The Hobbit. So I got a blue ray print and was very excited because of the great reviews and rating that this enjoys on various sites. This is the story of a rat monkey from Sumatra who bites people and infects them, turning them into zombies with flesh eating urges. I could watch this till the hour mark and then had to shut it down again. The bad special effects, the amateurish acting, the weird camera angles and the 'different' direction might be cup of tea for his legions of fan boys but they made for a very jarring movie watching experience. I understood that the movie is deliberately over the top like Evil Dead but it could not grip me at all. A few scenes were pretty hilarious but the overall sense remains the same that I could have done without watching this. 2 out of 5 for Jackson's Dead Alive. If being grossed out is what you like you will enjoy this tremendously. For others, this is a mandatory skip.

    I have to admit, this is the best in horror-comedy genre and also the goriest film I've ever quenched :p Peter Jackson was fabulous in making the blend of comical and dreadful ingredients. His ace humor sense with brutish bloodbath scenes was just heavenly hellsome epic :p I could never forget those extremely jocular flashes---zombie sauce, zombie injection, zombie dinner, zombie sex, zombie child, zombie light, zombie butcher :DDDD Entire cast had also the credit to adapt themselves perfectly with such ghastly-jolly plot :pppp Wish Peter would make such gruesome-funny film again after his Hobbit trilogy venture :p

    I'm holding off giving this a top rating because of two flaws: # The crappy animations in some places, especially the rat-monkey at the beginning; # The rather plodding nature of the first half of the film. But, hey, I didn't expect the slash-tastic comedy gore fest that would ultimately ensue. It had me laughing my head off by the end, it was that good. One of the best comedy-horrors I've ever seen. Once things really got going the ideas kept coming thick and fast, one after another, delivering some absolutely amazing content and fabulous entertainment. Even the creepy uncle turned into an axe-wielding zombie bashing dude. I didn't really appreciate the humour element at first such as gluing mother's face back together so that she could keep up appearances in front of the visiting guild members, but once the line "I kick ass in the name of the Lord" was uttered I started to fully grasp the manic tongue-in-cheek element of it all. It must have been an absolute riot to film and be involved with. Thanks for making this film and sharing it with us, Peter Jackson.

    Forget about the relentlessly stale zombie movies of today and just watch this instead. My favorite thing about this movie(besides the hilariously over the top gore)is the pacing. Dead Alive kicks off the action almost immediately and rarely lets up, which makes it a roller coaster of gross-out antics and violent mayhem. It's also a tribute to Peter Jackson's skill as a director; Not long into the film and already you have a very likable cast and setting(which is somewhat rare in these types of movies). I wouldn't recommend this movie if you're squeamish, but if you enjoy(or at least can tolerate) loads of blood, guts, and some truly vomit-inducing moments, look no further.

    Without a doubt best gory flick ever made by one of the best cinematic master of our time Mr. Peter Jackson.Kudos to him for making a successful horror comedy which did not become just another sadist movie just like most of the zombie flicks today. First thing you do not need a Oscar winning writer for a zombie flick,it did not have although the great Mr.Jackson won some of that later still this movie has social satire fact and criticized our taste and our love for movies.But at the end of the day when its pleased you and if the violence stays on screen is not that the happiest place on earth?oh!that Disney.Whatever. If you are a zombie movie fan than this is the bible for you.Well it has everything-zombie + gore +bad acting + more gore+ a crappy origin story(better than resident evil series)+and more gore ...oh and did I mention how much gore it has?then stop reading this crap and go for it. k

    The first question that comes to my mind reviewing this movie is the reason why I saw it? I saw it for Peter Jackson, I was in total awe of his imagination and direction in the Lord of The Rings and to some extend King Kong too. He also did a very fine job with Heavenly creatures, so I was intrigued as to how such a prolific director would deal with the slasher genre. So, before writing any comment on the movie one thing that has to be taken into account is the fact that it was a pioneer in the Zombie movie genre and that is the only reason why this movie pulls off an otherwise loony, outrageous and over acted display of skills. This is probably just an experimental movie for Peter Jackson, I couldn't help noticing the Skull Island mention that also features in the King Kong. Why it's difficult for me to appreciate this movie now is because after films like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland the bar of Zombie genre movies has been set real high.
