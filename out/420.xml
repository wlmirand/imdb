    I remembered my mom always putting this movie on for me when I came home from school when I was maybe 7 and younger. I absolutely loved and enjoyed this movie and still do. I can't wait to watch it again on Friday with my family :) You should really watch this movie if you haven't. The story is incredible to me. I wish I had an imagination like Alice. The hatter and the Cheshire cat.. <3 My friend's also enjoy this movie. Great memories. We watch it every time we have a sleep over. I guarantee you will enjoy this movie weather you are a young kid or an adult.I wish I could find the DVD to this movie. I can only find it on Netflix :P

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    I remembered my mom always putting this movie on for me when I came home from school when I was maybe 7 and younger. I absolutely loved and enjoyed this movie and still do. I can't wait to watch it again on Friday with my family :) You should really watch this movie if you haven't. The story is incredible to me. I wish I had an imagination like Alice. The hatter and the Cheshire cat.. <3 My friend's also enjoy this movie. Great memories. We watch it every time we have a sleep over. I guarantee you will enjoy this movie weather you are a young kid or an adult.I wish I could find the DVD to this movie. I can only find it on Netflix :P

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.

    After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and many other animated films to come after it, there came a time when Walt Disney would adapt a famous story in his vision that would involve a much different tale. That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic. The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney. It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point. However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like "Painting the roses red" or "The un-birthday song". The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience. This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude. Even the few likable characters can get tiresome.

    What a time to be a child! Today is so tainted with obviousness and technological abundance that the age of imagination seems long over. As a future father, I hope my child would walk on the edge of a sidewalk imagining it's a tightrope above a ravine, or avoiding the red paved stones that would be bottomless pits. I wish modernity would never destroy this treasure which is imagination, the only natural craving to never be fully satisfied. And Lewis Carrol's "Alice in Wonderland" pushes this natural thirst for escapism to an overdose-like limit, featuring one of the richest and most colorful galleries of character in literature's history, so many peculiar creatures that have enriched our memories, from a wisecracking cat to a hurried rabbit, a gluttonous walrus or a tyrannous Queen. Just like "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Little Prince", we follow the journey of a child, embarked (or trapped) in a fantastic world where friendly and hostile encounters would provide valuable lessons. Both picaresque and coming-of-age stories, their timeless and universal appeal wakes up children's capability to learn from imagination, the closest form of philosophy for a child, the eternal dream of a world 'over the rainbow' or under a river, where dreams come true. And who was more entitled, skilled and anticipated than Walt Disney to adapt this literary exhilaration of imagination into a film to unfortunately meet with relative disappointment. Indeed, regardless of the film's initial intent, it obviously didn't succeed, and exploring the reasons of this mixed reaction made me wonder if the project wasn't doomed from the beginning. Most of the first Disney features, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Cinderella", were adapted from fairy-tale stories, short enough to leave room for new plot devices, artistic licenses, memorable songs or better characterizations of the villains and peripheral characters. Yet "Alice in Wonderland" features so many characters that even a ratio of one-per-minute wouldn't have been enough to cover the 60-minute format, and it's such a classic of literature it inevitably compromised any attempt to deviate from the original story. I had the chance to grow up with the 80's animated series of "Alice in Wonderland" and each episode was centered on a Wonderland character, including some that were absent from the film like the Duchess or Humpty-Dumpty. While the series-format fitted the episodic structure of the story (the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Oysters' story, each had a specific episode dedicated to it) unfortunately, in the film, there was not enough time to generate an appeal. Much worse, through all her interactions, Alice was constantly abused, teased and tormented by wisecracking and snobbish creatures. Even the cute flowers who resurrected the magic of "Flowers and Trees" started acting as pompous divas. And Alice's streak of bad luck didn't end there and went on and on until the climactic confrontation with the Queen, probably the only character with relative substance, even more than Alice. Alice is still an endearing heroine as she mirrors our child's fears and curiosities. We all imagined how it would feel be to be bigger and smaller, or been tempted to taste or drink some mysteriously appetizing food. It's still ironic that all through her adventure, she only becomes more annoyed and suspicious, as if the underlying lesson of her adventure was that sometimes, a nonsensical world could be as tough and rough as reality. After all, when there is no place for conventions, when un-birthdays are celebrated, it also conceals such positive aspects of real-life as good manners and courtesy. And if Dorothy came to the conclusion that 'there was no place like home', she would still have a soft spot for this wonderful world of Oz and the friends she met, while Alice would probably be traumatized by her trip in Wonderland.. However, if the episodic structure and the characters' meanness seemed to have canceled the positive effect the film could have, time played like a solid ally and allowed the same kids who were puzzled by the film to appreciate its surrealistic aspect as adults. At the peak of the drug culture that prevailed in the late 60's and early 70's, the film met with a new public and garnered more positive reactions, admittedly opposite to the values for which Disney stood for but since when does Disney only appeal to children? And the enumeration of "Alice"' flaws became totally pointless as soon as you regard the film as a surrealistic adventure, without purpose, where the only thrills come from literally wondering what comes after. Why does Alice follow the rabbit, if not because it's simply the seemingly linear structure of dreams as a series of episodes without a beginning (the Rabbit was already walking) and without an end, as suggested by the climactic chase in the maze. The poetry of dreams lies in their inner anarchy and total freedom. But I concede that the surrealistic aspect wouldn't necessarily make the film more enjoyable, it's still a little too zany and cacophonous. I had the same reaction while comparing two Bunuel movies: "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" and wondering if a short story wouldn't better fit the dream-format. Maybe this is why Alice could have made a great animated series, even more since Disney make his debut through a live-action animated series inspired by Alice's adventure. We all enjoy a little trip sometimes, and maybe this is why the four minutes of "Pink Elephants in Parade" in "Dumbo" will forever be more unsettling, disturbing and memorable than "Alice in Wonderland". It's easy to speculate on the causes of the film's semi-success: too ahead of its time, not aimed for the right target, too unstructured or unfocused, there still is something undeniably appealing, if only on the imagery department and the gutsy deviation from the usual Disney material, and "Alice in Wonderland" is still a wonder in the history of Disney's animated features.

    Have you ever dreamed of a world that is the exact opposite of your world in almost every way imaginable? Have you dreamed of a world where "the books would be nothing but pictures"? Have you dreamed of a world where "the flowers would talk for hours"? In the case of Alice, the main character from Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature Alice in Wonderland, that's exactly the kind of world she wants to escape to. After she sees a white rabbit with a coat and a pocket watch who claims that he's "late for an important date", she becomes curious about where he's going and follows him into a rabbit hole. This rabbit hole leads her to a world called Wonderland which is basically the kind of world she was talking about escaping to. In other words, this world is very much the opposite of the world she came from in that any sense of logic seems to be completely absent in this world. Whenever she takes just one bite or sip of a single food or drink, respectively, she literally either shrinks too much or grows too much. Throughout her adventures in Wonderland, she discovers many other unusual inconsistencies (such as animals running around in the ocean to "get dry"), comes across some insane characters (the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Cheshire Cat) and realizes that maybe she was better off in her world than in this world she dreamed of. If there is one thing that I have learned from this film, it is that you get what you wish for sometimes, for better or worse. Hopefully, the next time Alice thinks of a dream place that she would like to explore, she'll think of a place where everything that takes place makes much more sense than it does in Wonderland. If you think about it, Alice in Wonderland is basically a cautionary tale of sorts in that it shows us the consequences of not thinking about every single little detail regarding what you want. In Alice's case, she didn't think any magical world such as this would be this wacky or nonsensical. It's not just the main moral one learns from this story that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up well after at least 60 years. Another key element that makes Alice in Wonderland hold up as well as it does is the main character herself, Alice. Out of all the female lead characters that were created while Walt Disney was alive (which includes Alice, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959)), Alice is easily the best developed one of the bunch in my opinion. What sets her apart from her other counterparts is that she has a sense of independence. Unlike Aurora and Snow White who basically allow any creature in sight to basically make decisions for them, Alice makes all of her decisions by herself regarding if she wants to stay or go somewhere else as well as what's right or wrong. I also think that Alice is a more identifiable character than any of her other predecessors in that she has a certain curiosity not just for this world, but for everything else in general. I think I am able to identify with someone who wants their curiosity to be fulfilled rather than someone who wants to be married and live happily ever after. Though the film's songs by Oliver Wallace may not be quintessential Disney music, it's still pretty good. I liked the songs "In a World of My Own", "All in a Golden Afternoon", and the title song well enough. The song "Very Good Advice" was weird though in my mind since it was basically a combination of singing and crying, and if you're not into that type of stuff, this song isn't for you. The animation may not be as detailed as something like Bambi (1942), but that's okay since the style of the drawing and the backgrounds definitely fit for this kind of world. In other words, the animation works very well as it is. The famous scene between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare does a very good job at further demonstrating how unpredictable and wacky the inhabitants of Wonderland really are. The fact that the Mad Hatter notices a full cup of tea, believes it's empty, and everyone apparently has to move to another seat on the table because of it is just one of a couple of instances that prove how wacky these characters are. The final act when Alice meets the Queen of Hearts also proves the wackiness of Wonderland very well, too. The way the Queen of Hearts orders her servants' heads to be chopped off for the silliest reasons is simply brilliant. To be frank though, I could have done without an earlier scene between Alice and the caterpillar since it was more tedious than interesting. I really liked watching Alice in Wonderland when I was a kid and I still enjoy watching it now even despite the fact that it's for different reasons than when I was young. I guarantee that other Disney animated fairy tales that came out at that time (like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Cinderella (1950)) would be even better if the main characters for those films were as well developed as Alice in this film. Because of the film's strong moral, strong lead character and the crazy, imaginative world it shows us, Alice in Wonderland is an underrated Disney gem that you owe it to yourself to take a look at.

    After the huge success of Cinderella, they wanted to put out another movie and in the summer of 1951, they put out Alice in Wonderland, which did not do so well then. The story is about a girl named Alice that falls in a whole while following a White Rabbit. Tech hole leads her into a world called Wonderland. She then mets a bunch of characters and is in an adventure of a lifetime. The story can be very episodic and boring. For the entire movie, she meets a character, they say and/or act unusual and don't make sense, something wacky happens, and then she moves on, with those characters never to be seen again. The plot in this is not very strong at all. The characters are as flat and one dimensional as they can be, but I think they Re suppose to be like that. They are memorable though, everyone knows the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Queen of Hearts, and of course the main character Alice. This story is not much about plot and character, which is a problem for me, but you mint still like it. The songs are not very memorable as well. I remember that down sound like the songs from other Disney films at the time, but I cannot label any of them. The animation is impressive as usual. It is in the same style as Cinderella, and the colours and contrast are extremely bold. The character styles are very good and detailed as well. If you like a whole lot of wackiness, and a story that is no much about story or character development, you will like it. This film is a bit different from the Lewis Carrol books, but if you like the books, give this movie a watch. If you like in depth movies with in depth characters, this movie is probably not for you

    Alice in Wonderland (1951) *** (out of 4) Disney classic about teenaged Alice who follows a rabbit into a mysterious hole, which leads her down a big drop off and into the world of Wonderland. Once there Alice meets all sorts of strange characters as they lead her on an adventure like she's never experiences. There's no question that ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves the "classic" label but at the same time I think this is a lesser classic from the studio. I have one major problem with this film and it's the fact that it just never struck me as being all that magical or adventurous. If you're read any of the Alice books, seen any of the earlier or later films then you know there's quite a bit of magic going on in the stories but I don't think that comes across too well. Perhaps this is due to there simply being too many characters and none of the supporting ones really standing out among everything. Of course the Alice character is a great one as is the Mad Hadder and the rabbit but outside of these there are many supporting ones that just show up, have a few nice lines if that and then they're gone. I'd say the overall story has a somewhat strange mix and match going on as well with too many scenes that just feel out of place. Still, there's no question that the animation is downright beautiful and this is especially true once we get to all the vivid colors of Wonderland. Another major plus is that there are some pretty funny moments including the various scenes where Alice is either shrinking or growing too tall. The sequence where she gets stuck inside the small house is just priceless. ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't flawless but there's certainly a lot of charm that helps keep it moving along.

    Being a big fan of "Alice", both the books and Disney's adaptation of the tale, I can see that there are several things in the movie that doesn't match up to the book. For example, the 'Unbirthday' song, although a very catchy and memorable song in the movie, has its own share of inaccuracy, as unbirthdays are not introduced by the Mad Hatter and March Hare, but by Humpty Dumpty in the original "Through the Looking Glass", the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" of 1865. As another example, the doorknob doesn't even exist in the books, but is a character created by Walt Disney, probably to fill in the gaps that Lewis Carroll would have filled in by his narration. If you think about it, the reason so many things are different is for time's sake, or for the fact that some things look better in books than they do in movies. In the books, Alice often goes off talking to herself about a subject for a whole two pages at a time, but this would look odd in a movie. As for the scene with the duchess and her baby (in this bit I'm assuming you've read the book), I personally think it would not end up looking as good in a movie. Although "Alice" is very odd in itself, you can consider why Disney did not include these things so it wouldn't get to out of hand, and therefore confusing and perhaps a small bit exhausting to watch. Even if he was adapting a book, he needed his own personal touch on things, the one we are all so familiar with, the one that makes it so "Disney." As for one complaint I have seen among critics, concerning the fact that "Alice"'s animation is closer to the Disney cartoons than that of his movies, I say that after thinking about it, I honestly don't care. This wasn't something I noticed in particular, but when I consider it, the movie's entire nature screams cartoon. It's fun and vivid script and songs are perfect for the cartoon-based, bright animation. Back to the subject of the book relative to the movie, when watching the movie I honestly did not care. It was Wonderland, it was a good Wonderland and it was Wondrous enough for me, even if it may not have been word-for-word from Carroll's original version. Next time you read it, or when you first pick up the book, enjoy imagining the characters as the ones Disney provided. I can honestly say I enjoyed the book, even more than I would have normally, reading it with these images. Thinking of some of the other parts not included in the movie, I can admit that I prefer the movie without the Duchess, or the Mock Turtle, or the mouse at the beginning right before the Caucus Race. Disney has sparked imagination, brought a smile to my face, and, unlike many filmmakers' attempts (such as, I'd say, Burbank Films' version), has kept every last drop of, well, wonder, from the original story, and plunged it into his own take. The characters are fun and memorable, as well as the songs, score, scenes, and (often-quoted) lines. I would almost prefer visiting Disney's Wonderland to Carroll's, even though I am one for the original. So even though the version leaves out maybe half of the books, and twists the story a good bit, the magic is still there, and with this said, I think it's safe to say that this can be considered the best movie version out there, and Lewis Carroll himself would have approved in a heartbeat.

    Alice in Wonderland is a movie that's different from the other Disney Classics. Instead of having a crazy character or two, everyone is crazy; maybe a physcopath (how do I spell this word?) would be a better world. Seeing this from an adult's point of view, this film teaches us that no wonderland is perfect; it's corrupt and strange and such. Utopia is the first word that comes to mind when watching this film or even thinking about it. Wonderland is portrayed as such a magical land with mythical characters with wacky things and all; it's not that way, it teaches us that even a "wonderland" can be corrupt. It's sad, but true. I think it's very good. It's definitely more mature that some of the classics. unique characters, wonderful animation, great storyline, and a lot of peer pressure. To all the teenagers reading this, when a stranger or someone gave you "eat/drink" me in something, imagine what Alice went though when she was pressured to do this. It might teach you to not take drugs or get drunk. Plus the many drugs and drug references in this movie. My friend told me this is a great movie after you've been through such and I find it kind of true. It's weirdly good in a way and fun too! There are 2 things to learn from this movie... 1)Wonderlands aren't what you expect to be 2)Peer Pressure is bad

    I think it would be fair to say that the 1951 Disney animated film is most people's introduction to Lewis Carroll...while I blush to admit it, it was certainly mine. However, having read the books and seen various other adaptations of the stories of "Alice," I find that this one is vastly overrated. Before I go into the problems with this movie (for me), let me give the good things: first of all, the animation is simply superb, and Mary Blair's color styling and backgrounds give everything a very surreal, cartoonish look...indeed, this whole film feels more like a return to the original "Silly Symphonies" for the sheer amount of "cartoon logic" it packs into it, which, in its own unique way, actually heightens the absurdity of Wonderland and its many wacky denizens beyond what even Carroll and John Tenniel envisioned. The voice acting is superb, and the characters are well done: prior to this movie, I can't think of a single film that captured the characters so well. The 1933 film has...problems, the silent films, obviously, were silent, and there are two films before the 1951 movie that have been lost, so it's hard to count those, as I've never actually seen them, and, sadly, probably never will. Specific aspects of the characters never before transferred from the pages of the Charles Dodgson's work to film successfully are well defined: Alice's curiosity and innocence, the White Rabbit's impatience and neurosis, the Mad Hatter and March Hare's zaniness, the Queen of Heart's frightful temper, and the mischievous nature of the Cheshire Cat, just to name a few, are all well played, and the voice actors  for the characters I've listed, that means Kathryn Beaumont, Bill Thompson, Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, and Sterling Holloway (who also appeared in the 1933 film)  are excellently picked. To be honest, it's hard for me to find anything particularly WRONG with this movie, other than the fact that it contains fewer characters from the stories than most people think, and the ones not present in this movie, while very often present in other adaptations, are largely forgotten because of this. Being as much of an advocate for "pure Carroll" as I am, that just bugs me beyond compare. Several poems, bits of dialogue, and other moments are meshed together, dumbed down, or just omitted completely, to the point where this particular film seems less of an adaptation of the books and more of a reimagination, but, let's face it, Disney's just notorious for that sort of thing. Also, the designs  while wonderful  are almost never like John Tenniel's illustrations, or only vaguely resemble them...I think Alice herself is the only exception. But, gripes aside, do I hate this movie? Hardly! It is one of my favorite films created by Disney, and one of my favorite takes on "Alice" made. Still, as the "building block" that many other adaptations are based on, I don't feel it deserves the reputation it has. Still, it's a very important film, both for the legacy of Lewis Carroll and the Walt Disney Studio, so I guess it deserves a good amount of credit, and I love it all the same. It's also, in my opinion, the best way to introduce Lewis Carroll's work to kids: it's rather lighthearted, especially for a Disney film (these movies are A LOT darker than many people give them credit), and the spirit of Carroll is decently embodied, and the music and characters are great; if you haven't said "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date" at least once in your lifetime, you are officially dehumanized. Other "kid flick" takes on the stories warp and twist it to fit another medium, like "Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland" or Sesame Street's "Abby in Wonderland." This one doesn't: it changes a lot, but it doesn't include previously established characters or a heck of a lot of pop-culture references either, which is a plus. If you haven't seen it, not only are you an extremely strange person, but you REALLY need to.

    To put it simply, Alice In Wonderland is bizarre. To put it less simply, Alice In Wonderland explores the oddities of a child's imagination, and the utter weirdness of a seemingly mad person to such an extent as to create one of the strangest films I have ever seen. We all know the story. Alice sees a white rabbit exclaiming "I'm late, I'm late!" over and over, and of course, silly Alice, follows the talking rabbit down a rabbit hole and into the land of...well, wonder. Like all Disney films, memorable characters abound. Yes, Alice is a little thinly drawn (really, all the characters are a bit one dimensional), but in the same way, they're all so distinct, and unlikely to be forgotten. The strong voice cast only supports this. Alice In Wonderland is far weirder than I expected. At times, it seems to make no sense whatsoever. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Curiously enough, I laughed very little during this film. I smiled a lot though, and the utter weirdness of it all was so absurd, I could not help but be entertained, though I retained any laughter. The one primary scene that provoked laughter was the "Tea Time" scene with the Mad Hatter. It's even more outrageous on screen than it is in the book. Alice In Wonderland certainly does not represent the height of Disney films, or even animated films in general. What it does represent, is a solid film with no real flaws, but not exceedingly entertaining. It serves it's purpose as a weird and enjoyable film, but does not extend it's hand any farther.
