    I haven't sen the play, before I saw this film, but this is once more one of those plays which might be really great to see in the theater, and that might be electric on stage, but doesn't really function all that good as a movie. We meets couple of old men, usually meeting each other on a park bench. They talk about everything, amongst some lies and fantasies, and his is a day we meet them. A day which is more special than others. The two old men at played by Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis. I love the theater, as I love film. And sometimes it functions well to turn a play into a movie. But a film goer will most likely demand more. But great acting is a blast to watch. Both leading actors are doing a good job, and in the theater I really could see them performing perfectly. The acting is theatrical, no wonder, but on film I think it falls a bit through as a bit too theatrical. Still I think an older audience will enjoy this more than a younger audience, which will expect more action. This is a talkative movie, full of wisdom and truth. And full of sentimentality. It's a heart warming play. It way more than two old guys on a bench all the film through, as written by a reviewer here. Don't believe that.

    Though I have worked in almost all aspects of the theater business, I do not agree with many of my colleagues when it comes to film tastes. I do not like film adaptations of stage plays because the origins are most of the times in evidence, but that seems to be what my friends enjoy more: to be remembered that they watch filmed theater. But this one (winner of New York's Tony award) I liked quite a lot, although it is also the case: in spite of the efforts to emphasize its outdoors setting, it is based on word interchange, and most of the action is verbal and static, depending mostly on criss-cross editing. This time though you have two exceptional actors, with the additional plus that they are not of the kind that goes around with a sign on his/her face or chest that reads "I'm the Greatest Actor" (and I can think of quite a few). You don't find plays everyday in which the main characters are a Jewish militant of the Left and a black janitor, both very old. These people are not glamorous, their lives were not full of heroics, and old age is not epic, but one spends a good time with these two folks, even if a couple of subplots could have been omitted. Perhaps, due to the fact that Herb Gardner the playwright adapted his work and also directed it, the film is overlong. But one day when you are not in a rush, and have time for Matthau and Davis, enjoy them. It is better than watching aimless young Germans in Portugal for two hours, in something called "Body Rice"...

    Actually, I not only smiled, I laughed out loud. I'm 70 and did not feel that this movie is sad, as some of the other reviewers have suggested. Those two old guys were making the best out of the time they had left,an encouraging message for us old folks. Unlike so many of today's movies, there was an engaging plot and solid character development. So many of the movies I see these days substitute visual effects,sex scenes,violence, and vulgar language for plot and character development. Also, although it was 130 minutes long,those minutes moved quickly. Three cheers for Walter Matthau! Three cheers for Ossie Davis! Three Cheers for Herb Gardener!

    I have neither read nor seen the play that this was based upon, so maybe that's part of why I didn't like it. With the author of it writing the screenplay for, *and* directing, this, I can only assume that it is a good representation of his initial vision for the story. Unless of course he doesn't "get" the medium of film, and/or should have(R.I.P.) handed the reins over to someone else, once he had committed the text to paper. I don't know. Perhaps I'm too young and I haven't experienced enough in life to fully appreciate this. All are quite possible, and I am not at all saying that everyone will dislike this. But I can't claim that I particularly cared for it. It's got a pretty slow pace, and it doesn't seem to hit the mark for what it's trying to say. I realize that it is about whether or not one ought to fight those in charge, about acceptance and loss, and about not being considered useless simply because of being a senior citizen. This just does not perfectly express those. Also, for being a comedy, I can't claim to have found more than a single line to be funny. The characters are well-written and fleshed out. I can't speak ill of the acting, Matthau and Davis are excellent. Heck, even Nelson impressed me, for the first time. Production-wise, this is fine. There's brief violence and a little drug use in this. I recommend this mainly to fans of those who made it, and/or of the theater version. 6/10

    In CITIZEN KANE, Kane's most faithful associate and friend, Mr. Bernstein (now Chairman of the Board of Kane's empire) tells the reporter that aging is the only disease that nobody looks forward to the cure of (i.e. death). I'M NOT RAPPAPORT is a look at just how ultimately dreary and awful old age becomes for most of us. Yet it is a comedy - because in humor we manage to find reason to survive and even flourish a little. I was lucky to see the play on stage with Judd Hirsch and the late Clevon Little. It was a good production, and had less slow spots than the film (which occasionally slows down to try to find something visual to satisfy the viewing audience - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't). Hirsch and Little had good rapport in the roles of Nat and Midge, the elderly Jewish radical and the elderly African-American super. Both are now considered out-of-date and expendable. In short they are old, and at best are part of the background, and at worst bandied about by careless or vicious younger people. Midge is suffering from reoccurring cataracts and glaucoma. He is the still smart engineer of his apartment's boiler room (and he demonstrates a remarkable ability to pinpoint a car engine's problems too). But he is 81 or so and the building is turning coop. They don't need an antiquated super for their new image (they are even getting a new boiler so they don't need his expertise!). Nat is in a similar position, but he is imaginative and clings to a fanatical devotion to the socialist-and communist labor viewpoint that permeated the Jewish districts of the lower East Side and Brooklyn from 1900 to 1947. He is able to demonstrate an inventiveness to promote the defense of people's rights. But frequently (too frequently) he does not realize that his actions might injure the people that he thinks he is helping. As he was dying Frederick Douglas yelled to remember to always "agitate!". He was right. But Douglas realized you had to agitate for change that was possible. Nat can't realize this, as he falls under the romance of his various guises and lies. The play and film covered actually three months, but the first act and second were in the course of a single pair of days. Midge (here Ossie Davis) faces dismissal from the spokesperson of the tenant's group taking over the building (Danford - Boyd Gaines). But Danford is really a softy, and even is willing to try to get a severance package for Midge that is larger than the one he offers. Just as they are about to agree Nat (Walter Matthau) shows up and pretends he is a labor union lawyer nicknamed "the cobra" who will destroy Danford unless he retains Midge in the job. For awhile this works...until a member of the tenant's group eventually finds out Nat lied. Then Midge gets even less than he was supposed to. Nat (who actually was once a waiter - nothing else) similarly manages to harm Laurie (Martha Plimpton), a recovering addict and artist, who owes $2,000.00 to Cowboy (Craig T. Nelson) for drugs. He pretends to be a "Godfather" with Midge as his bodyguard. Cowboy is not fooled, but is seriously annoyed. So it goes with all Nat's plans and attempts to spread the zeal of activism. For nobody really cares outside of their immediate self-interest. As his drained but loving daughter (Amy Irving) tells Nat, the old fights are just that...old fights. Nobody cares about them anymore. And yet the fervor in Nat's voice, recalling an historic rallying point in New York Labor history in 1909, or the sudden care and bravery of Midge when Nat is in danger show these men are worthy of respect. Only one person really comes close to respecting them...Danford. He is younger by decades, but he is aware (in his late 30s) that he lacks the physical strength he only had five years earlier. When Matthau basically says that Davis's only sin is his old age, Matthau reminds Danford that one day he too will be a member of the old age club. Danford is very aware of that. Matthau brings to Nat his mad vitality (as Hirsch brought a type of intellectual memory to the same role). Davis is not as energetic as Little was on stage, but he does bring a degree of comfort to the role - an African-American of 80 years who knows what is expected by society of his type, but has found ways to circumvent it as much as possible. Irving makes Nat's daughter his tragic, loving victim - caring for him, but finding him rejecting her overtures to care for him. People aware of Nelson as "Coach" will be amazed by his vicious streak - but he is still able to be a good deadpan/straight-man to Matthau at the end. And Gaines certainly makes Danford more thoughtful than one could imagine. Oh...Willie Howard. "I'm not Rappaport" is an old routine of that Broadway clown, where he drives a stranger crazy insisting he is Rappaport, although he does not resemble the gentleman in any way. Howard never was a Hollywood star, so it is nice that the play resurrected his memory a little here.

    very slow, very long, very quiet, which is perfect considering the film is about two old men trying to battle their age.the pace and mood of the film fits perfectly into its content. it is a very artistic movie with just enough reality to keep it Sincere yet enough adventure to keep it enjoyable.although a major plot in the movie is that of drugs and drug addiction, it seems to take a rather light hearted approach to it which keeps the issue of age close at all times, the relationship between that of Nat and his daughter is one that i have seen all to often in life and leaves you with a sense of pity.this is a subject that isn't touched on enough when it comes to film. it truly is a must see movie

    Despite being old and worn, Nat Moyer has not lost any of his energy and is still the rabble rouser that he grew up around. He misses the Union days and the fact that none of his peers seem interesting in fighting "the man" anymore. He spends his days in the park where he finds that the employment of acquaintance Midge Carter provides him plenty to get worked up about. Although Nat himself may be a mess underneath the surface he soon finds the problems of those he meets to be distracting enough even as his own issues remain unresolved. Starting out with a scene that gives us a certain amount of insight into the character of Nat, the film takes a fairly slow pace and isn't helped by the fact that the drama is rather forced and unconvincing for long sections of it. Although there is an element of character study within the film, the "adventures" of Nat and Midge are slightly stretched and prevented me seeing the characters are people. In an out and out comedy, this wouldn't be a problem but this is not so much a comedy as it is a drama and it does rather take away from the impact it has. It still does enough to be interesting to watch but I could see what it was trying to do and it was a bit of a problem for me that it didn't seem to be able to do it. The slow pace isn't helped by the length of the film and I can understand why many viewers will be frustrated by this when combined with the way that it is hard to be involved with. The strongest sections of the film are those that ignore the adventures but concentrate on the two men and the dynamics between them  it is here we get to the core of the characters (or at least as close as we get). This is also helped by fine acting from the lead two. Matthau is his usual funny self but also has an air of the tragic  he convinces well as a man who may be delusional, crazy or just plain lonely and in denial. Davis has less of the lime light since he plays more of a straight man to Matthau, but he does it well. These two make the film better than the material suggests and although the support is OK, I didn't really think that the film made good use of Irving, Nelson, Plimpton, Diaz and others  mainly they just set up the adventures and providing a bit more of a way into Nat. Overall this is an OK film but just don't expect anything special. It isn't particularly funny, nor is it meant to be; more worryingly the character aspect of it doesn't come off that well and, if it weren't for the presence of Mattau and Davis, I doubt it would have worked at all. Worth a try but be wary of the length, slow pace and the feeling that it is consistently missing the target.

    This is a gentle heart warming film, that to me has a quintessential qualities that make Walter Mathau such a great actor. It is not the comedy in which he excelled at in films like 'The Odd Couple'. It is the way he bullies the script and the camera. This he does well but with not as much aplomb in 'The Sunshine Bys'. To see a film where the script is paramount is wonderful, and to have an actor such as Mathau at the centre of it conducting it with all his mastery skill is a delight to watch. The supporting cast around Mathau equip themselves well. They are not overpowered by his fame or skill. At times it feels as though you are actually there watching events unfold. This is a credit to the director who while keeping it looking like the good film it is, also brings you in as though you are the only person in the world watching the film. Although I have only watched the film on the television, I feel that I would have felt the same effect had I been watching the film in the cinema. This is a rare effect, too many times films can have that distant feel. It is the directors's skill, and the skill and art of the actors that this is never lost. I watched this film, when I had to fill half an hour of time. The result was that I was glued to the seat unable to pull myself away.

    This is a predictable little film about two old geezers puttering around Central Park. Worth seeing for Matthau's and Davis' chemistry, but thats about it. The biggest problem with this film is that it runs far too long for its subject matter. The same story could have been told in about 75 minutes, but they had to extend it to a long 135 minutes, which was a mistake. Many people will be bored by this film, but a few may really enjoy it, especially those really interested in politics. **/****. If you really want to see this two old actors together, your best bet would be Grumpy Old Men, which was a truly funny and entertaining movie.

    I'm Not Rappaport (1996) tells about two old men, Jewish Nat Moyer (Walter Matthau) and black Midge Carter (Ossie Davis), who spend their days in the park discussing many important issues.The movie is based on the late's Herb Gardner's play and he also directed it.Davis and Matthau shine together in the lead.If it wasn't for them, this may be a worse movie.They really make it work.Then again, when you put a black man and a Jew together in a same movie, you just can't fail. Sadly they're both gone now.Matthau died nearly five years ago, Davis we lost last Friday.This 87 year old master was found dead in a hotel room in Miami, where he was filming a movie (Retirement).He was a good man.He fought for the black people's rights and he knew both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, jr.You will be greatly missed, Ossie Davis. Other great actors include Amy Irving, Craig T. Nelson, Martha Plimpton etc.This is a extremely sympathetic independent comedy with two sympathetic men.I can recommend it for all the sympathetic people.

I'M NOT RAPPAPORT is a look at just how ultimately dreary and awful old age becomes for most of us.

Hirsch and Little had good rapport in the roles of Nat and Midge, the elderly Jewish radical and the elderly African-American super. Both are now considered out-of-date and expendable. In short they are old, and at best are part of the background, and at worst bandied about by careless or vicious younger people. Midge is suffering from reoccurring cataracts and glaucoma. He is the still smart engineer of his apartment's boiler room (and he demonstrates a remarkable ability to pinpoint a car engine's problems too). But he is 81 or so and the building is turning coop.

But Danford is really a softy, and even is willing to try to get a severance package for Midge that is larger than the one he offers. Just as they are about to agree Nat (Walter Matthau) shows up and pretends he is a labor union lawyer nicknamed "the cobra" who will destroy Danford unless he retains Midge in the job. For awhile this works...until a member of the tenant's group eventually finds out Nat lied. Then Midge gets even less than he was supposed to.

When Matthau basically says that Davis's only sin is his old age, Matthau reminds Danford that one day he too will be a member of the old age club. Danford is very aware of that. Matthau brings to Nat his mad vitality (as Hirsch brought a type of intellectual memory to the same role). Davis is not as energetic as Little was on stage, but he does bring a degree of comfort to the role - an African-American of 80 years who knows what is expected by society of his type, but has found ways to circumvent it as much as possible. Irving makes Nat's daughter his tragic, loving victim - caring for him, but finding him rejecting her overtures to care for him. People aware of Nelson as "Coach" will be amazed by his vicious streak - but he is still able to be a good deadpan/straight-man to Matthau at the end. And Gaines certainly makes Danford more thoughtful than one could imagine. Oh...Willie Howard. "I'm not Rappaport" is an old routine of that Broadway clown, where he drives a stranger crazy insisting he is Rappaport, although he does not resemble the gentleman in any way. Howard never was a Hollywood star, so it is nice that the play resurrected his memory a little here.

    very slow, very long, very quiet, which is perfect considering the film is about two old men trying to battle their age.the pace and mood of the film fits perfectly into its content. it is a very artistic movie with just enough reality to keep it Sincere yet enough adventure to keep it enjoyable.although a major plot in the movie is that of drugs and drug addiction, it seems to take a rather light hearted approach to it which keeps the issue of age close at all times, the relationship between that of Nat and his daughter is one that i have seen all to often in life and leaves you with a sense of pity.this is a subject that isn't touched on enough when it comes to film. it truly is a must see movie

    Despite being old and worn, Nat Moyer has not lost any of his energy and is still the rabble rouser that he grew up around. He misses the Union days and the fact that none of his peers seem interesting in fighting "the man" anymore. He spends his days in the park where he finds that the employment of acquaintance Midge Carter provides him plenty to get worked up about. Although Nat himself may be a mess underneath the surface he soon finds the problems of those he meets to be distracting enough even as his own issues remain unresolved. Starting out with a scene that gives us a certain amount of insight into the character of Nat, the film takes a fairly slow pace and isn't helped by the fact that the drama is rather forced and unconvincing for long sections of it. Although there is an element of character study within the film, the "adventures" of Nat and Midge are slightly stretched and prevented me seeing the characters are people. In an out and out comedy, this wouldn't be a problem but this is not so much a comedy as it is a drama and it does rather take away from the impact it has. It still does enough to be interesting to watch but I could see what it was trying to do and it was a bit of a problem for me that it didn't seem to be able to do it. The slow pace isn't helped by the length of the film and I can understand why many viewers will be frustrated by this when combined with the way that it is hard to be involved with. The strongest sections of the film are those that ignore the adventures but concentrate on the two men and the dynamics between them  it is here we get to the core of the characters (or at least as close as we get). This is also helped by fine acting from the lead two. Matthau is his usual funny self but also has an air of the tragic  he convinces well as a man who may be delusional, crazy or just plain lonely and in denial. Davis has less of the lime light since he plays more of a straight man to Matthau, but he does it well. These two make the film better than the material suggests and although the support is OK, I didn't really think that the film made good use of Irving, Nelson, Plimpton, Diaz and others  mainly they just set up the adventures and providing a bit more of a way into Nat. Overall this is an OK film but just don't expect anything special. It isn't particularly funny, nor is it meant to be; more worryingly the character aspect of it doesn't come off that well and, if it weren't for the presence of Mattau and Davis, I doubt it would have worked at all. Worth a try but be wary of the length, slow pace and the feeling that it is consistently missing the target.

    This is a gentle heart warming film, that to me has a quintessential qualities that make Walter Mathau such a great actor. It is not the comedy in which he excelled at in films like 'The Odd Couple'. It is the way he bullies the script and the camera. This he does well but with not as much aplomb in 'The Sunshine Bys'. To see a film where the script is paramount is wonderful, and to have an actor such as Mathau at the centre of it conducting it with all his mastery skill is a delight to watch. The supporting cast around Mathau equip themselves well. They are not overpowered by his fame or skill. At times it feels as though you are actually there watching events unfold. This is a credit to the director who while keeping it looking like the good film it is, also brings you in as though you are the only person in the world watching the film. Although I have only watched the film on the television, I feel that I would have felt the same effect had I been watching the film in the cinema. This is a rare effect, too many times films can have that distant feel. It is the directors's skill, and the skill and art of the actors that this is never lost. I watched this film, when I had to fill half an hour of time. The result was that I was glued to the seat unable to pull myself away.

    This is a predictable little film about two old geezers puttering around Central Park. Worth seeing for Matthau's and Davis' chemistry, but thats about it. The biggest problem with this film is that it runs far too long for its subject matter. The same story could have been told in about 75 minutes, but they had to extend it to a long 135 minutes, which was a mistake. Many people will be bored by this film, but a few may really enjoy it, especially those really interested in politics. **/****. If you really want to see this two old actors together, your best bet would be Grumpy Old Men, which was a truly funny and entertaining movie.

    I'm Not Rappaport (1996) tells about two old men, Jewish Nat Moyer (Walter Matthau) and black Midge Carter (Ossie Davis), who spend their days in the park discussing many important issues.The movie is based on the late's Herb Gardner's play and he also directed it.Davis and Matthau shine together in the lead.If it wasn't for them, this may be a worse movie.They really make it work.Then again, when you put a black man and a Jew together in a same movie, you just can't fail. Sadly they're both gone now.Matthau died nearly five years ago, Davis we lost last Friday.This 87 year old master was found dead in a hotel room in Miami, where he was filming a movie (Retirement).He was a good man.He fought for the black people's rights and he knew both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, jr.You will be greatly missed, Ossie Davis. Other great actors include Amy Irving, Craig T. Nelson, Martha Plimpton etc.This is a extremely sympathetic independent comedy with two sympathetic men.I can recommend it for all the sympathetic people.
