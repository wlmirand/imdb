    I remembering seeing this in my local video shop and well didn't think much, but I ended up picking this up anyway, kinda by accident and when I got round to watching this, well it wasn't bad, not amazing or brilliant, and not terrible, but somewhere in the middle. I think that this is the only slasher with an office setting, which is a shame as it could be quite interesting. To my surprise this movie has quite a few familiar faces such as Carol Kane (When A Stranger Calls), Molly Ringwald (The Breakfast Club) and Jeannie Tripplehorn (Basic Instinct). The plot seemed interesting enough, a mousey employee goes on a killing spree when she's handed her pink slip at the office. The tone is surprisingly light Carol Kane plays her part well as down trodden would be serial killer Doreen, without going over the top and I really enjoyed Molly Ringwald as the bitchy secretary whose sole purpose is to be a total bitch. But some aspects of this movie simply doesn't work, like the comedy element is almost entirely humourless, the characters are plain and boring and didn't feel for them when they got killed. I would have liked this movie to go a lot darker and the killings to be a lot more innovative instead they were just boring and lacked any thrills. All in all not a terrible waste of time, but is kind of forgettable which makes this movie very average, but seeing familiar faces in a movie like this is always fun.

    A mousy office worker (Carol Kane) accidentally kills one of her coworkers, then proceeds to bump off a few others. Besides Carol Kane, the "star" of this film is Molly Ringwald, who shows us that she is no longer America's sweetheart. Her adult acting ventures have not panned out so well for her. And I am not saying she is a bad actress, but after her John Hughes years, she will have to do more than appear in one or two disposable films to re-create herself. And does Carol Kane age? I had always believed she was older in "Princess Bride", but now know she was only 35 (and therefore 45 here). I am not sure if I am impressed by her lack of aging or dismayed that she has always looked 60 years old... But, as far as the film goes, I just did not think it was that great. There was some humor, but nothing that really hit me (I have seen other comments from people who think it is funny, but I disagree). The dead body effects are decent, but there is just something about the film quality that gives off an "amateur" effect and makes the whole thing seem poor. And I do not mind independent films if they are done right, so it is not just the cheap look but something about how it comes across here. Not my cup of tea.

    Office Killer, written by Elise MacAdam, is the first feature film directed by Cindy Sherman, best known for clever references to classic films in her still photography and utilizes some excellently placed commercial visuals to joke on the slasher film in a very low-key fashion. Sherman always frames for types over specifics of character - this avoidance of in-depth characterization leaves the viewer distanced and uninvolved, and ultimately is what converts the horror-based tale into a comedy. Because we are shown the gloss of the narrative rather than the motivations of the lead character Dorine and her needs, we remain uninvolved except for some tasty flash backs from Dorine that fill in some gaps, the story still remains outside of the character's head.

    This movie is strangely entertaining, I don't really know why. The story isn't anything special, it's just the old concept where a harmless person becomes murderous for really vague reasons. Our office killer kills someone by accident, and that somehow makes her start killing people on purpose. Very well, I'll take it. So we get to see her murder a bunch of people, just one after the other, and it's well, there is no right adjective. It's not funny because people are dying gory deaths, it's not shocking because well, look at this thing, but it is pretty good. I believe it's kind of a tongue-in-cheek kind of thing, and I believe it's working. Carol Kane also plays her role very well, helped by the screenplay that's gradually making her character meaner. At one point she encounters some girl scouts selling cookies. What follows is just not cool. Well, maybe a little. I'm also really digging this ending. Either way, this is essentially following a formula, but there's still some creativity involved here and there and I appreciate that.

    "Office Killer" is a disappointing and not very worthwhile slasher. **SPOILERS** As the company begins downsizing, Dorine Douglas, (Carol Kane) is sent off to work at home, while Norah Reed, (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and her friend Kim Poole, (Molly Ringwald) are concerned over what the move will do for the morale of everyone else in the company. As a hectic new workload starts up and everyone suddenly starts to begin disappearing, she seems to think that someone is on the inside causing all of it, only for everything to still turn out fine when required. When she tries to get rid of her, she ends up losing her job instead, and when that leads to more people on the staff going missing, they finally figure out that she's a killer and race to stop her before it's too late. The Good News: There wasn't much to this one. Really, the only thing about this one is the slashing and it's kills. Despite their not being a whole lot of kills , the few in here are pretty graphic, with their being a neck sliced open with a metallic food processor, an impaling with a knife in the stomach, a really severe electrocution that burns major parts of the body and a great burning alive when set on fire. These are pretty much all the kills anyway, and they're the bloodiest and most brutal ones. The only other part to this is a few mildly interesting stalking scenes. The confrontation in the hallway, with the choking and being unable to see the stalker makes it come off nicely, and the finale in the basement is fine, gets a little better when the lights go out and overall is pretty tense and bloody. These few moments give the film it's only good points. The Bad News: There wasn't a whole lot wrong with this one, since there wasn't much to it. The mere fact that, outside of the gore and the aforementioned stalking scenes, at all really happens. This one here is pretty dull and boring, as most of the time is spent on running the magazine and everyone reacting to the ranting and raving of the boss, which is not all that interesting or leads to anything which produces any excitement. This mostly comes because this one doesn't really seem all sure whether or not as a comedy, which several scenes tend to throw out, such as the gathering of corpses in the basement or the treatment at the office missing only a laugh-track to signal the humor. The black humor in here hardly gives us any big laughs. There are a couple of scenes which are mildly amusing but nothing in here manages to really evoke the laughs it was going for and it utterly fails as a comedy. These failed attempts at humor only succeed in making this one even more dull and boring than it already is. The Final Verdict: Without much about it that really stands out for this one and a couple flaws, there's not a whole lot to this one worth mentioning. This should really only be for those who understand or enjoy these kinds of slashers, while those who prefer other types of slasher should heed caution. Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence

    this movie is obviously about someone who kills people in the office.and we learn very quickly who the killer is,so i don't think it's possible to give too much away.Said killer is knebbish office worker Dorine Douglas(Carol Kane).Douglas is a very lonely,insecure waif who lives with her overbearing mother.Douglas decides to begin killing people in her office,after witnessing one of her co-workers accidentally get killed.Douglas realizing she feels something akin to joy at his death.and she covers his death up.i should mention that most of her fellow workers treat her with disdain,or worse,even to the point of cruelty and hurtful remarks.so she feel justification for her feelings.soon,she dispatches another co-worker and then another.thing is,once she starts,she just keeps going and going and going.(like the Energizer Bunny)as the bodies mount up,Douglas also starts killing co-workers who are actually not that mean to her.and then,just about anyone she comes in contact with,she kills(i mean anyone).I have to say that Cane does a very good job in the role.her character becomes quite gleeful of her work,treating it something akin to getting an A plus on a report card.(you can tell Cane had a lot of fun with this role).she is a true sociopath,to be sure.and she engages in some very amusing rituals which i won't go into here.let's just say,you have to see it to believe it.so,what genre does this movie fall into?well,horror,to be sure and suspense, and most prevalent,black comedy,very black.there are also a lot of intentional campy moments.some of the situations are so absurd and over the top,you have to laugh.this movie works on all levels and it proves you don't need a gi-normous(gigantic/enormous) budget to make a very effective movie.truly a unique piece of art.

    The first question that would come to mind would be whether Carol Kane could play a psycho successfully. And after seeing this film, I would have to say I still don't know because the very tame screenplay didn't allow her to be a well developed psychotic, nor did it allow any other sort of development for any other aspect of this film. The storyline here is very typical. It involves Carol Kane (with very odd penciled in eyebrows) as an awkwardly mousy, hardworking magazine editor in a drab and depressing looking office building where she gets picked on daily. Then, without any time wasted, the inevitable psycho switch gets flipped and she starts killing off her coworkers. I know that may sound to most like your typical fun slasher, but in fact, it can't even be considered a slasher. Actually, I really don't know what genre to categorize this film in because it dips it's toes in a couple different sub-genres without ever fully concentrating on any one area, therein lying the problem. The resulting film just doesn't quite work. At the start, it seemed to be heading into satire territory with office politics and such, but quickly falls flat because of a major lack of humor. As it went on, it then seemed I was in for a slasher, but all of the murders take place off screen, giving us no chase sequences, creative deaths or gore. Then I expected it to take a turn into suspense, but was left with no tension or any sort of character development whatsoever, so I never cared for anyone or anything enough to ever get involved in the storyline. The writers just didn't seem to know what they really wanted, which kind of left the final product in limbo. And it's pretty disappointing because the photographer turned director, Cindy Sherman, seemed to have talent and would have benefited greatly if it were a straight up thriller. So what were we meant to feel during this film? It wasn't smart, funny, thrilling or even bloody. Were we supposed to hate and fear Kane? Or were we supposed to root for her? The whole film felt just as awkward as she looked and felt just as drab and boring as the office building looked, which leaves us with no reason to ever want to visit. I would compare this to later films, such as Love Object and the Willard remake, both of which used the same plot techniques, yet executed them in a much more entertaining fashion. Office Killer isn't a terrible film. I give the director and cast credit for trying. But it's just so lifeless that I can't recommend you wasting your time with it.

    In the mid-90's, there was this weird trend where 80's New York art stars were all given the chance to direct feature films. The less-than-impressive results: Robert Longo's "Johnny Mnemonic," David Salle's "Search and Destroy," Julian Schnabel's "Basquiat" and finally Cindy Sherman's "Office Killer." That only Schnabel moved on to direct a second feature says a lot about these poor directorial choices. Surprise - just because you can paint a picture or take a photograph doesn't mean you know how to make a movie. That said, "Office Killer" has a unique look to it: Sherman's photographic eye makes for some nice creepy compositions, even if her philosophy about using a camera cinematically is of the bolt-it-to-the-ground-and-maybe-pan-a-little school. And she works well with cinematographer Russell Fine, though the whole film is shot through a murky lens that had this viewer crying out for the occasional bright exterior just to add a little contrast. So what went wrong with "Office Killer"? Well, pretty much what you'd predict would go wrong with a photographer director who had never made a film before: uneven pacing; more attention paid to the setup of a shot than to what's going on in it; a lack of tension; and a cast who, with the exception of the ever-willing Carol Kane, don't seem to know what to do. Aware that they're working for a famous photographer, they quietly obey, even while Sherman clearly has little experience in working with actors. Michael Imperioli and Jeanne Tripplehorn have been far better elsewhere, Barbara Sukowa is flat-out bad, and Molly Ringwald is her usual depthless self. The script is also somewhat leaden, given its dark comic potential. "Office Killer" is still a curiosity, interesting mainly for aficionados of Cindy Sherman's work (and you've got to admire those cool opening credits), though horror fans who enjoyed the better-received "May" (which I personally didn't care for) might like this movie's look and mood. As for me, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this is the product of a bunch of chuckling New York hipsters who thought they were doing something "postmodern" and "ironic" but only churned out something uninspired and limp... albeit artsy.

    I can't believe I JUST now found and watched this movie as well. It played tonite on Showtime Beyond! I was searching for a good movie to watch tonite and I got nothing, until i came upon the title "Office Killer" HA! anything with the word Killer in the title automatically grabs my attention. Thank GOD I stayed on the channel and waited for it to begin - it was FREAKIN AMAZING! Histaricaly amazing! Kane does a wonderful job and I think I literally was smiling the WHOLE time. I felt like a crazy like Dorine! And Molly Ringwald, i will always love her. Everything about this film was perfect, literally. I have GOT to own this!

    i think i can account for the discrepancy between my vote and the average vote posted on IMDb. see, this movie was directed by cindy sherman, and therefore is to be viewed as much as a work of art as just another film. this is the same woman who began the whole movement to undermine the historical accuracy with which he accepted photographic works. she showed thru her art not only that there is a shared collective consciousness that is highly malleable and that the photographer can make the viewer a part of the art. i realize that by casting molly ringwald a lot of people may have thought they were getting another, something bad, i don't know.

I know that may sound to most like your typical fun slasher, but in fact, it can't even be considered a slasher. Actually, I really don't know what genre to categorize this film in because it dips it's toes in a couple different sub-genres without ever fully concentrating on any one area, therein lying the problem. The resulting film just doesn't quite work. At the start, it seemed to be heading into satire territory with office politics and such, but quickly falls flat because of a major lack of humor. As it went on, it then seemed I was in for a slasher, but all of the murders take place off screen, giving us no chase sequences, creative deaths or gore. Then I expected it to take a turn into suspense, but was left with no tension or any sort of character development whatsoever, so I never cared for anyone or anything enough to ever get involved in the storyline. The writers just didn't seem to know what they really wanted, which kind of left the final product in limbo. And it's pretty disappointing because the photographer turned director, Cindy Sherman, seemed to have talent and would have benefited greatly if it were a straight up thriller. So what were we meant to feel during this film? It wasn't smart, funny, thrilling or even bloody. Were we supposed to hate and fear Kane? Or were we supposed to root for her? The whole film felt just as awkward as she looked and felt just as drab and boring as the office building looked, which leaves us with no reason to ever want to visit. I would compare this to later films, such as Love Object and the Willard remake, both of which used the same plot techniques, yet executed them in a much more entertaining fashion. Office Killer isn't a terrible film. I give the director and cast credit for trying. But it's just so lifeless that I can't recommend you wasting your time with it.

    In the mid-90's, there was this weird trend where 80's New York art stars were all given the chance to direct feature films. The less-than-impressive results: Robert Longo's "Johnny Mnemonic," David Salle's "Search and Destroy," Julian Schnabel's "Basquiat" and finally Cindy Sherman's "Office Killer." That only Schnabel moved on to direct a second feature says a lot about these poor directorial choices. Surprise - just because you can paint a picture or take a photograph doesn't mean you know how to make a movie. That said, "Office Killer" has a unique look to it: Sherman's photographic eye makes for some nice creepy compositions, even if her philosophy about using a camera cinematically is of the bolt-it-to-the-ground-and-maybe-pan-a-little school. And she works well with cinematographer Russell Fine, though the whole film is shot through a murky lens that had this viewer crying out for the occasional bright exterior just to add a little contrast. So what went wrong with "Office Killer"? Well, pretty much what you'd predict would go wrong with a photographer director who had never made a film before: uneven pacing; more attention paid to the setup of a shot than to what's going on in it; a lack of tension; and a cast who, with the exception of the ever-willing Carol Kane, don't seem to know what to do. Aware that they're working for a famous photographer, they quietly obey, even while Sherman clearly has little experience in working with actors. Michael Imperioli and Jeanne Tripplehorn have been far better elsewhere, Barbara Sukowa is flat-out bad, and Molly Ringwald is her usual depthless self. The script is also somewhat leaden, given its dark comic potential. "Office Killer" is still a curiosity, interesting mainly for aficionados of Cindy Sherman's work (and you've got to admire those cool opening credits), though horror fans who enjoyed the better-received "May" (which I personally didn't care for) might like this movie's look and mood. As for me, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this is the product of a bunch of chuckling New York hipsters who thought they were doing something "postmodern" and "ironic" but only churned out something uninspired and limp... albeit artsy.

    I can't believe I JUST now found and watched this movie as well. It played tonite on Showtime Beyond! I was searching for a good movie to watch tonite and I got nothing, until i came upon the title "Office Killer" HA! anything with the word Killer in the title automatically grabs my attention. Thank GOD I stayed on the channel and waited for it to begin - it was FREAKIN AMAZING! Histaricaly amazing! Kane does a wonderful job and I think I literally was smiling the WHOLE time. I felt like a crazy like Dorine! And Molly Ringwald, i will always love her. Everything about this film was perfect, literally. I have GOT to own this!

    i think i can account for the discrepancy between my vote and the average vote posted on IMDb. see, this movie was directed by cindy sherman, and therefore is to be viewed as much as a work of art as just another film. this is the same woman who began the whole movement to undermine the historical accuracy with which he accepted photographic works. she showed thru her art not only that there is a shared collective consciousness that is highly malleable and that the photographer can make the viewer a part of the art. i realize that by casting molly ringwald a lot of people may have thought they were getting another, something bad, i don't know.

    I remembering seeing this in my local video shop and well didn't think much, but I ended up picking this up anyway, kinda by accident and when I got round to watching this, well it wasn't bad, not amazing or brilliant, and not terrible, but somewhere in the middle. I think that this is the only slasher with an office setting, which is a shame as it could be quite interesting. To my surprise this movie has quite a few familiar faces such as Carol Kane (When A Stranger Calls), Molly Ringwald (The Breakfast Club) and Jeannie Tripplehorn (Basic Instinct). The plot seemed interesting enough, a mousey employee goes on a killing spree when she's handed her pink slip at the office. The tone is surprisingly light Carol Kane plays her part well as down trodden would be serial killer Doreen, without going over the top and I really enjoyed Molly Ringwald as the bitchy secretary whose sole purpose is to be a total bitch. But some aspects of this movie simply doesn't work, like the comedy element is almost entirely humourless, the characters are plain and boring and didn't feel for them when they got killed. I would have liked this movie to go a lot darker and the killings to be a lot more innovative instead they were just boring and lacked any thrills. All in all not a terrible waste of time, but is kind of forgettable which makes this movie very average, but seeing familiar faces in a movie like this is always fun.

    A mousy office worker (Carol Kane) accidentally kills one of her coworkers, then proceeds to bump off a few others. Besides Carol Kane, the "star" of this film is Molly Ringwald, who shows us that she is no longer America's sweetheart. Her adult acting ventures have not panned out so well for her. And I am not saying she is a bad actress, but after her John Hughes years, she will have to do more than appear in one or two disposable films to re-create herself. And does Carol Kane age? I had always believed she was older in "Princess Bride", but now know she was only 35 (and therefore 45 here). I am not sure if I am impressed by her lack of aging or dismayed that she has always looked 60 years old... But, as far as the film goes, I just did not think it was that great. There was some humor, but nothing that really hit me (I have seen other comments from people who think it is funny, but I disagree). The dead body effects are decent, but there is just something about the film quality that gives off an "amateur" effect and makes the whole thing seem poor. And I do not mind independent films if they are done right, so it is not just the cheap look but something about how it comes across here. Not my cup of tea.

    Office Killer, written by Elise MacAdam, is the first feature film directed by Cindy Sherman, best known for clever references to classic films in her still photography and utilizes some excellently placed commercial visuals to joke on the slasher film in a very low-key fashion. Sherman always frames for types over specifics of character - this avoidance of in-depth characterization leaves the viewer distanced and uninvolved, and ultimately is what converts the horror-based tale into a comedy. Because we are shown the gloss of the narrative rather than the motivations of the lead character Dorine and her needs, we remain uninvolved except for some tasty flash backs from Dorine that fill in some gaps, the story still remains outside of the character's head.

    This movie is strangely entertaining, I don't really know why. The story isn't anything special, it's just the old concept where a harmless person becomes murderous for really vague reasons. Our office killer kills someone by accident, and that somehow makes her start killing people on purpose. Very well, I'll take it. So we get to see her murder a bunch of people, just one after the other, and it's well, there is no right adjective. It's not funny because people are dying gory deaths, it's not shocking because well, look at this thing, but it is pretty good. I believe it's kind of a tongue-in-cheek kind of thing, and I believe it's working. Carol Kane also plays her role very well, helped by the screenplay that's gradually making her character meaner. At one point she encounters some girl scouts selling cookies. What follows is just not cool. Well, maybe a little. I'm also really digging this ending. Either way, this is essentially following a formula, but there's still some creativity involved here and there and I appreciate that.

    "Office Killer" is a disappointing and not very worthwhile slasher. **SPOILERS** As the company begins downsizing, Dorine Douglas, (Carol Kane) is sent off to work at home, while Norah Reed, (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and her friend Kim Poole, (Molly Ringwald) are concerned over what the move will do for the morale of everyone else in the company. As a hectic new workload starts up and everyone suddenly starts to begin disappearing, she seems to think that someone is on the inside causing all of it, only for everything to still turn out fine when required. When she tries to get rid of her, she ends up losing her job instead, and when that leads to more people on the staff going missing, they finally figure out that she's a killer and race to stop her before it's too late. The Good News: There wasn't much to this one. Really, the only thing about this one is the slashing and it's kills. Despite their not being a whole lot of kills , the few in here are pretty graphic, with their being a neck sliced open with a metallic food processor, an impaling with a knife in the stomach, a really severe electrocution that burns major parts of the body and a great burning alive when set on fire. These are pretty much all the kills anyway, and they're the bloodiest and most brutal ones. The only other part to this is a few mildly interesting stalking scenes. The confrontation in the hallway, with the choking and being unable to see the stalker makes it come off nicely, and the finale in the basement is fine, gets a little better when the lights go out and overall is pretty tense and bloody. These few moments give the film it's only good points. The Bad News: There wasn't a whole lot wrong with this one, since there wasn't much to it. The mere fact that, outside of the gore and the aforementioned stalking scenes, at all really happens. This one here is pretty dull and boring, as most of the time is spent on running the magazine and everyone reacting to the ranting and raving of the boss, which is not all that interesting or leads to anything which produces any excitement. This mostly comes because this one doesn't really seem all sure whether or not as a comedy, which several scenes tend to throw out, such as the gathering of corpses in the basement or the treatment at the office missing only a laugh-track to signal the humor. The black humor in here hardly gives us any big laughs. There are a couple of scenes which are mildly amusing but nothing in here manages to really evoke the laughs it was going for and it utterly fails as a comedy. These failed attempts at humor only succeed in making this one even more dull and boring than it already is. The Final Verdict: Without much about it that really stands out for this one and a couple flaws, there's not a whole lot to this one worth mentioning. This should really only be for those who understand or enjoy these kinds of slashers, while those who prefer other types of slasher should heed caution. Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence

    this movie is obviously about someone who kills people in the office.and we learn very quickly who the killer is,so i don't think it's possible to give too much away.Said killer is knebbish office worker Dorine Douglas(Carol Kane).Douglas is a very lonely,insecure waif who lives with her overbearing mother.Douglas decides to begin killing people in her office,after witnessing one of her co-workers accidentally get killed.Douglas realizing she feels something akin to joy at his death.and she covers his death up.i should mention that most of her fellow workers treat her with disdain,or worse,even to the point of cruelty and hurtful remarks.so she feel justification for her feelings.soon,she dispatches another co-worker and then another.thing is,once she starts,she just keeps going and going and going.(like the Energizer Bunny)as the bodies mount up,Douglas also starts killing co-workers who are actually not that mean to her.and then,just about anyone she comes in contact with,she kills(i mean anyone).I have to say that Cane does a very good job in the role.her character becomes quite gleeful of her work,treating it something akin to getting an A plus on a report card.(you can tell Cane had a lot of fun with this role).she is a true sociopath,to be sure.and she engages in some very amusing rituals which i won't go into here.let's just say,you have to see it to believe it.so,what genre does this movie fall into?well,horror,to be sure and suspense, and most prevalent,black comedy,very black.there are also a lot of intentional campy moments.some of the situations are so absurd and over the top,you have to laugh.this movie works on all levels and it proves you don't need a gi-normous(gigantic/enormous) budget to make a very effective movie.truly a unique piece of art.

    The first question that would come to mind would be whether Carol Kane could play a psycho successfully. And after seeing this film, I would have to say I still don't know because the very tame screenplay didn't allow her to be a well developed psychotic, nor did it allow any other sort of development for any other aspect of this film. The storyline here is very typical. It involves Carol Kane (with very odd penciled in eyebrows) as an awkwardly mousy, hardworking magazine editor in a drab and depressing looking office building where she gets picked on daily. Then, without any time wasted, the inevitable psycho switch gets flipped and she starts killing off her coworkers. I know that may sound to most like your typical fun slasher, but in fact, it can't even be considered a slasher. Actually, I really don't know what genre to categorize this film in because it dips it's toes in a couple different sub-genres without ever fully concentrating on any one area, therein lying the problem.
