 <sinopse>
  After a simple jewelery heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Six criminals, who are strangers to each other, are hired by a crime boss Joe Cabot to carry out a diamond robbery. Right at the outset, they are given false names with an intention that they won't get too close and concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads amongst the group members and one of them is killed in the subsequent shootout along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point (a warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.

    Tarantino made a memorial debut as a director on this, Reservoir Dogs. The story is quite simple describing six robbers who call each other by color. They fail to thieve jewels and become doubtful about each other. I know this movie gains high ratings but compared with Pulp Fiction, this doesn't look as good as that. &nbsp;Although there're many great directions as ever, for me this lacks refreshment after watching. However, opening scene is cool and talk about "like a virgin" makes me laugh. Also, musics are nice. The actors Tarantino chose are always refined. Especially, I like Mr. Orange and Mr. White. Besides, Tarantino himself is attractive! In spite of skillful story-telling by moving axis of time, the important story itself fascinates me so much. &nbsp;In the middle of the movie, I became bored. Still, there're full of humor and violence. You will be satisfied with them.

    The first movie by legendary director Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of gangsters trying to work out who betrayed them to the police. Set mainly in a warehouse in the aftermath of a failed bank robbery. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth lead the fantastic ensemble, despite one of them having a bullet in there gut for all of the movie. Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi co-star as the psychotic maniac and the weaselly coward who doesn't believe in tipping. Chris Penn (who looks and sounds exactly like Jonah Hill) and Lawrence Tierney are the two minor members of the gang but make there mark on the movie and still have memorable performances. All of the actors, especially Buscemi, do a brilliant job and are one of my favourite movie line ups ever. Although it sounds quite simple at first the plot of Reservoir Dogs stems out into flashbacks and each gangsters account of what happened. Much like Tarantino's next (and best) movie Pulp Fiction, the dialogue and script is what really makes the movie a classic. Reservoir Dogs has two famous musical scenes which you will have definitely seen many parodies of even if you didn't know it. Both have retro 70's soundtracks because while all the chaos and double crossing is going on, the radio is having a Super Sounds of the 70's Weekend. Without the jazzy backing tracks neither of the most memorable scenes in the movie would be as - well - memorable. Finally the ending of the movie, which is perfect. Tarantino does the impossible and gets us to feel sorry for the evil murdering Reservoir Dogs. I give Reservoir Dogs an excellent rating of 8.9/10. Definitely in my Top 50 Movies of All Time. http://www.IMDb.com/list/AoqmUADYknU/

    Great movie! It's about a band of guys with code names that are colors robbing a jewelry store. However, the heist goes bad and the robbers have to scatter. Slowly they meet up at the safe house to discuss what went wrong, how & why. For Tarentino's first film with a low budget, he really pulled off an amazing film. There's violence, guns, torture, and a story all thrown together beautifully! Once I first saw this film, I immediately rented Tarantino's other movies and had a marathon. Most of his other films a great, but this one knocked it outta the park! The music is also great (if you're into 70s music). The only reason I rated this a 9 instead of 10 is because there are a couple of moments where the story gets a little dull (a couple of the characters' back stories were kinda 'eh...). But the twist near the end was great. Overall, I loved it and would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes crime drama!

    Review #4 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews I'm just gonna go ahead and say it: I think this movie is better than Pulp Fiction. Unlike most of the Tarantino fans, I think this movie was a little bit better than Pulp. I just liked the story and characters more. Anyway, let me talk about THIS movie. Reservoir Dogs is a timeless classic. There are no smartphones, iPads, or laptops. Just good old fashioned killing. No spoilers, the story is about a group of men who are pulling off a bank heist. But when it goes terribly wrong, they think they have a rat working for the police in their midst. This is followed by paranoia, suspicion, and rage. (I didn't differ very much from the IMDb description, so I don't believe any spoilers were revealed.) This story is very captivating, and the actors make it that way with no-bull performances. Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn were all in the early stages of their acting careers, and this movie was their big break. In fact, if Harvey Keitel hadn't agreed to produce it and star in it, it probably wouldn't have even seen the light of day; or at least it wouldn't have been as big as it is now. The script is very compelling and stylish. It gives a certain edge to the movie that made it better. A lot of this movie's dialogue has been quoted many times. My point- it was a very memorable movie. Overall, you have to see Reservoir Dogs. It is a timeless classic that defined Tarantino movies for the rest of his career. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    This movie is my favourite movie of all time, so far.. Reservoir Dogs in my opinion is one of Tarantino's greatest work, in my opinion it is no doubt the best, and therefore one of the greatest movies that will ever be made. The reasons being are that this film has so much 'style'. Every director has his/her own style, and Tarantino's style is reflected in this movie throughout every single detail. I love the fact that this takes a 'cliche' narrative (a diamond heist) and transforms it into something far more. We never even see the diamonds, it's not about the diamonds, it's about something far more important; the relationship between these men. The idea, again in my opinion is that there is no definitive good and bad. Throughout this movie I felt as though I really knew these characters, and I liked these guys. Never the less, these guys were in a sense 'bad', they killed cops, innocent men and women. They stole diamonds, and eventually killed each other. Saying all this, these guys are some of the coolest to ever be created in a film.

    Reservoir Dogs, simply put, is one of the best crime films ever made. A uniquely stylized viewpoint, combined with a colorful cast of specific and desperate characters allows this movie to live on forever in the crime genre. Trademark performances from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Harvey Kietel, Chris Penn and others give the viewer every possible perspective in a room full of thieves and ex-cons. In particularly specific conversations, the men articulate exactly what level of society they come from over cigarettes and broken balls. The search later on for the rat in the disjointed time line gives the audience something to think about and although you find out early who the cop in the crew is, you still have to follow on to see what the future holds for him. Fantastic Film.

    A bit of a clich&eacute; for those of us in college in the 1990's, but Reservoir Dogs was the movie that got me wondering what made the difference between movies I liked and movies I loved. I loved this movie. I was not able to finish watching it on a Sunday, as I had, as usual, put off tons of homework that needed immediate attention. I waited all week with Reservoir Dogs on my mind. I rented the videotape as soon as I was done with school for the week and just devoured this movie. Why did I like a movie where people just talked and talked? How could I remain on the edge of my seat with every word? What made the style of this movie so appealing? These questions led to me wanting to understand script writing, shooting and editing movies. It also was the beginning of a realization that understanding who directed a movie is key to finding movies I like. I immediately started following Quentin Tarantino's next project and was riveted by his interview with Charlie Rose and the clips of Pulp Fiction. I would see Pulp Fiction four times in the theater which was exactly twice the number of times I'd ever seen any other movie. Incredibly written, incredibly acted, and, most importantly, incredibly directed to be the kind of work that gets you forgetting it took work. I find myself just sitting and enjoying every minute.

    Reservoir Dogs is a classic Quentino Tarantino film: tough characters, non-linear storyline, lots of action, shootouts and no unnecessary shots. So that means everything is very precisely thought through. I found one theme very interesting for me in this movie and that is the alienation between the criminal team who is doing a diamond heist. Sure, criminals usually don't trust each other, but usually you have to trust a person very much if you are attempting to do a heist together. So it is quite interesting that the members of this team are deprived of their names, personality - they all are assigned names and they are all wearing the same outfit as if to say that in this heist they leave their personal lives and identities behind them and they are different people here. Although in the beginning there are many close shots as if trying to get into the personalities, trying to make you acquainted with them. Actually there is distance even between the people who have the same profession - I'm talking about the two policemen. The wide space between them suggests that even though they are in the same boat working for the same cause they are so different. One of them got in that place by mistake: he was captured and tortured. The other one got accepted to the team after he pretended that he is a criminal. Another thing which just deepens the alienation is what you can see from MR. White's example. If you get attached to someone you get punished. He trusted his hurt partner Mr Orange who apparently was a policeman and he defended him he killed his partners and then got shot himself by the police. Another great thing in this movie is the music: it is used just a few times, in the intro, credits and in the torture scene. Now in the torture scene the music is used to show distance from human emotion. The lack of music elsewhere adds the realistic sense to the movie. So this movie for me really shows how people are just working for one goal, not caring about each other, alienating each other from themselves.

    Reservior Dogs is a classic film and Quentin Tarantino is just an absolute genius. I really liked this film, it was gripping and suspenseful. Straight to the point and extremely well acted. A few of the scenes were very gruesome but they needed to be. Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde was just crazy but my personal favourite in this film was Chris Penn who played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, I found him to be hilarious. The story developed at a good pace even though it was mostly set in one place with just a few flashbacks. Overall this is well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 250 list, a classic film that everyone just has to see. 9/10.

    Tarantino made a memorial debut as a director on this, Reservoir Dogs. The story is quite simple describing six robbers who call each other by color. They fail to thieve jewels and become doubtful about each other. I know this movie gains high ratings but compared with Pulp Fiction, this doesn't look as good as that. &nbsp;Although there're many great directions as ever, for me this lacks refreshment after watching. However, opening scene is cool and talk about "like a virgin" makes me laugh. Also, musics are nice. The actors Tarantino chose are always refined. Especially, I like Mr. Orange and Mr. White. Besides, Tarantino himself is attractive! In spite of skillful story-telling by moving axis of time, the important story itself fascinates me so much. &nbsp;In the middle of the movie, I became bored. Still, there're full of humor and violence. You will be satisfied with them.

    The first movie by legendary director Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of gangsters trying to work out who betrayed them to the police. Set mainly in a warehouse in the aftermath of a failed bank robbery. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth lead the fantastic ensemble, despite one of them having a bullet in there gut for all of the movie. Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi co-star as the psychotic maniac and the weaselly coward who doesn't believe in tipping. Chris Penn (who looks and sounds exactly like Jonah Hill) and Lawrence Tierney are the two minor members of the gang but make there mark on the movie and still have memorable performances. All of the actors, especially Buscemi, do a brilliant job and are one of my favourite movie line ups ever. Although it sounds quite simple at first the plot of Reservoir Dogs stems out into flashbacks and each gangsters account of what happened. Much like Tarantino's next (and best) movie Pulp Fiction, the dialogue and script is what really makes the movie a classic. Reservoir Dogs has two famous musical scenes which you will have definitely seen many parodies of even if you didn't know it. Both have retro 70's soundtracks because while all the chaos and double crossing is going on, the radio is having a Super Sounds of the 70's Weekend. Without the jazzy backing tracks neither of the most memorable scenes in the movie would be as - well - memorable. Finally the ending of the movie, which is perfect. Tarantino does the impossible and gets us to feel sorry for the evil murdering Reservoir Dogs. I give Reservoir Dogs an excellent rating of 8.9/10. Definitely in my Top 50 Movies of All Time. http://www.IMDb.com/list/AoqmUADYknU/

    Great movie! It's about a band of guys with code names that are colors robbing a jewelry store. However, the heist goes bad and the robbers have to scatter. Slowly they meet up at the safe house to discuss what went wrong, how & why. For Tarentino's first film with a low budget, he really pulled off an amazing film. There's violence, guns, torture, and a story all thrown together beautifully! Once I first saw this film, I immediately rented Tarantino's other movies and had a marathon. Most of his other films a great, but this one knocked it outta the park! The music is also great (if you're into 70s music). The only reason I rated this a 9 instead of 10 is because there are a couple of moments where the story gets a little dull (a couple of the characters' back stories were kinda 'eh...). But the twist near the end was great. Overall, I loved it and would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes crime drama!

    Review #4 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews I'm just gonna go ahead and say it: I think this movie is better than Pulp Fiction. Unlike most of the Tarantino fans, I think this movie was a little bit better than Pulp. I just liked the story and characters more. Anyway, let me talk about THIS movie. Reservoir Dogs is a timeless classic. There are no smartphones, iPads, or laptops. Just good old fashioned killing. No spoilers, the story is about a group of men who are pulling off a bank heist. But when it goes terribly wrong, they think they have a rat working for the police in their midst. This is followed by paranoia, suspicion, and rage. (I didn't differ very much from the IMDb description, so I don't believe any spoilers were revealed.) This story is very captivating, and the actors make it that way with no-bull performances. Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn were all in the early stages of their acting careers, and this movie was their big break. In fact, if Harvey Keitel hadn't agreed to produce it and star in it, it probably wouldn't have even seen the light of day; or at least it wouldn't have been as big as it is now. The script is very compelling and stylish. It gives a certain edge to the movie that made it better. A lot of this movie's dialogue has been quoted many times. My point- it was a very memorable movie. Overall, you have to see Reservoir Dogs. It is a timeless classic that defined Tarantino movies for the rest of his career. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    This movie is my favourite movie of all time, so far.. Reservoir Dogs in my opinion is one of Tarantino's greatest work, in my opinion it is no doubt the best, and therefore one of the greatest movies that will ever be made. The reasons being are that this film has so much 'style'. Every director has his/her own style, and Tarantino's style is reflected in this movie throughout every single detail. I love the fact that this takes a 'cliche' narrative (a diamond heist) and transforms it into something far more. We never even see the diamonds, it's not about the diamonds, it's about something far more important; the relationship between these men. The idea, again in my opinion is that there is no definitive good and bad. Throughout this movie I felt as though I really knew these characters, and I liked these guys. Never the less, these guys were in a sense 'bad', they killed cops, innocent men and women. They stole diamonds, and eventually killed each other. Saying all this, these guys are some of the coolest to ever be created in a film.

    Reservoir Dogs, simply put, is one of the best crime films ever made. A uniquely stylized viewpoint, combined with a colorful cast of specific and desperate characters allows this movie to live on forever in the crime genre. Trademark performances from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Harvey Kietel, Chris Penn and others give the viewer every possible perspective in a room full of thieves and ex-cons. In particularly specific conversations, the men articulate exactly what level of society they come from over cigarettes and broken balls. The search later on for the rat in the disjointed time line gives the audience something to think about and although you find out early who the cop in the crew is, you still have to follow on to see what the future holds for him. Fantastic Film.

    A bit of a clich&eacute; for those of us in college in the 1990's, but Reservoir Dogs was the movie that got me wondering what made the difference between movies I liked and movies I loved. I loved this movie. I was not able to finish watching it on a Sunday, as I had, as usual, put off tons of homework that needed immediate attention. I waited all week with Reservoir Dogs on my mind. I rented the videotape as soon as I was done with school for the week and just devoured this movie. Why did I like a movie where people just talked and talked? How could I remain on the edge of my seat with every word? What made the style of this movie so appealing? These questions led to me wanting to understand script writing, shooting and editing movies. It also was the beginning of a realization that understanding who directed a movie is key to finding movies I like. I immediately started following Quentin Tarantino's next project and was riveted by his interview with Charlie Rose and the clips of Pulp Fiction. I would see Pulp Fiction four times in the theater which was exactly twice the number of times I'd ever seen any other movie. Incredibly written, incredibly acted, and, most importantly, incredibly directed to be the kind of work that gets you forgetting it took work. I find myself just sitting and enjoying every minute.

    Reservoir Dogs is a classic Quentino Tarantino film: tough characters, non-linear storyline, lots of action, shootouts and no unnecessary shots. So that means everything is very precisely thought through. I found one theme very interesting for me in this movie and that is the alienation between the criminal team who is doing a diamond heist. Sure, criminals usually don't trust each other, but usually you have to trust a person very much if you are attempting to do a heist together. So it is quite interesting that the members of this team are deprived of their names, personality - they all are assigned names and they are all wearing the same outfit as if to say that in this heist they leave their personal lives and identities behind them and they are different people here. Although in the beginning there are many close shots as if trying to get into the personalities, trying to make you acquainted with them. Actually there is distance even between the people who have the same profession - I'm talking about the two policemen. The wide space between them suggests that even though they are in the same boat working for the same cause they are so different. One of them got in that place by mistake: he was captured and tortured. The other one got accepted to the team after he pretended that he is a criminal. Another thing which just deepens the alienation is what you can see from MR. White's example. If you get attached to someone you get punished. He trusted his hurt partner Mr Orange who apparently was a policeman and he defended him he killed his partners and then got shot himself by the police. Another great thing in this movie is the music: it is used just a few times, in the intro, credits and in the torture scene. Now in the torture scene the music is used to show distance from human emotion. The lack of music elsewhere adds the realistic sense to the movie. So this movie for me really shows how people are just working for one goal, not caring about each other, alienating each other from themselves.

    Reservior Dogs is a classic film and Quentin Tarantino is just an absolute genius. I really liked this film, it was gripping and suspenseful. Straight to the point and extremely well acted. A few of the scenes were very gruesome but they needed to be. Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde was just crazy but my personal favourite in this film was Chris Penn who played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, I found him to be hilarious. The story developed at a good pace even though it was mostly set in one place with just a few flashbacks. Overall this is well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 250 list, a classic film that everyone just has to see. 9/10.

Definitely in my Top 50 Movies of All Time. http://www.IMDb.com/list/AoqmUADYknU/

    Great movie! It's about a band of guys with code names that are colors robbing a jewelry store. However, the heist goes bad and the robbers have to scatter. Slowly they meet up at the safe house to discuss what went wrong, how & why. For Tarentino's first film with a low budget, he really pulled off an amazing film. There's violence, guns, torture, and a story all thrown together beautifully! Once I first saw this film, I immediately rented Tarantino's other movies and had a marathon. Most of his other films a great, but this one knocked it outta the park! The music is also great (if you're into 70s music). The only reason I rated this a 9 instead of 10 is because there are a couple of moments where the story gets a little dull (a couple of the characters' back stories were kinda 'eh...). But the twist near the end was great. Overall, I loved it and would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes crime drama!

    Review #4 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews I'm just gonna go ahead and say it: I think this movie is better than Pulp Fiction. Unlike most of the Tarantino fans, I think this movie was a little bit better than Pulp. I just liked the story and characters more. Anyway, let me talk about THIS movie. Reservoir Dogs is a timeless classic. There are no smartphones, iPads, or laptops. Just good old fashioned killing. No spoilers, the story is about a group of men who are pulling off a bank heist. But when it goes terribly wrong, they think they have a rat working for the police in their midst. This is followed by paranoia, suspicion, and rage. (I didn't differ very much from the IMDb description, so I don't believe any spoilers were revealed.) This story is very captivating, and the actors make it that way with no-bull performances. Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn were all in the early stages of their acting careers, and this movie was their big break. In fact, if Harvey Keitel hadn't agreed to produce it and star in it, it probably wouldn't have even seen the light of day; or at least it wouldn't have been as big as it is now. The script is very compelling and stylish. It gives a certain edge to the movie that made it better. A lot of this movie's dialogue has been quoted many times. My point- it was a very memorable movie. Overall, you have to see Reservoir Dogs. It is a timeless classic that defined Tarantino movies for the rest of his career. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    This movie is my favourite movie of all time, so far.. Reservoir Dogs in my opinion is one of Tarantino's greatest work, in my opinion it is no doubt the best, and therefore one of the greatest movies that will ever be made. The reasons being are that this film has so much 'style'. Every director has his/her own style, and Tarantino's style is reflected in this movie throughout every single detail. I love the fact that this takes a 'cliche' narrative (a diamond heist) and transforms it into something far more. We never even see the diamonds, it's not about the diamonds, it's about something far more important; the relationship between these men. The idea, again in my opinion is that there is no definitive good and bad. Throughout this movie I felt as though I really knew these characters, and I liked these guys. Never the less, these guys were in a sense 'bad', they killed cops, innocent men and women. They stole diamonds, and eventually killed each other. Saying all this, these guys are some of the coolest to ever be created in a film.

    Reservoir Dogs, simply put, is one of the best crime films ever made. A uniquely stylized viewpoint, combined with a colorful cast of specific and desperate characters allows this movie to live on forever in the crime genre. Trademark performances from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Harvey Kietel, Chris Penn and others give the viewer every possible perspective in a room full of thieves and ex-cons. In particularly specific conversations, the men articulate exactly what level of society they come from over cigarettes and broken balls. The search later on for the rat in the disjointed time line gives the audience something to think about and although you find out early who the cop in the crew is, you still have to follow on to see what the future holds for him. Fantastic Film.

    A bit of a clich&eacute; for those of us in college in the 1990's, but Reservoir Dogs was the movie that got me wondering what made the difference between movies I liked and movies I loved. I loved this movie. I was not able to finish watching it on a Sunday, as I had, as usual, put off tons of homework that needed immediate attention. I waited all week with Reservoir Dogs on my mind. I rented the videotape as soon as I was done with school for the week and just devoured this movie. Why did I like a movie where people just talked and talked? How could I remain on the edge of my seat with every word? What made the style of this movie so appealing? These questions led to me wanting to understand script writing, shooting and editing movies. It also was the beginning of a realization that understanding who directed a movie is key to finding movies I like. I immediately started following Quentin Tarantino's next project and was riveted by his interview with Charlie Rose and the clips of Pulp Fiction. I would see Pulp Fiction four times in the theater which was exactly twice the number of times I'd ever seen any other movie. Incredibly written, incredibly acted, and, most importantly, incredibly directed to be the kind of work that gets you forgetting it took work. I find myself just sitting and enjoying every minute.

    Reservoir Dogs is a classic Quentino Tarantino film: tough characters, non-linear storyline, lots of action, shootouts and no unnecessary shots. So that means everything is very precisely thought through. I found one theme very interesting for me in this movie and that is the alienation between the criminal team who is doing a diamond heist. Sure, criminals usually don't trust each other, but usually you have to trust a person very much if you are attempting to do a heist together. So it is quite interesting that the members of this team are deprived of their names, personality - they all are assigned names and they are all wearing the same outfit as if to say that in this heist they leave their personal lives and identities behind them and they are different people here. Although in the beginning there are many close shots as if trying to get into the personalities, trying to make you acquainted with them. Actually there is distance even between the people who have the same profession - I'm talking about the two policemen. The wide space between them suggests that even though they are in the same boat working for the same cause they are so different. One of them got in that place by mistake: he was captured and tortured. The other one got accepted to the team after he pretended that he is a criminal. Another thing which just deepens the alienation is what you can see from MR. White's example. If you get attached to someone you get punished. He trusted his hurt partner Mr Orange who apparently was a policeman and he defended him he killed his partners and then got shot himself by the police. Another great thing in this movie is the music: it is used just a few times, in the intro, credits and in the torture scene. Now in the torture scene the music is used to show distance from human emotion. The lack of music elsewhere adds the realistic sense to the movie. So this movie for me really shows how people are just working for one goal, not caring about each other, alienating each other from themselves.

    Reservior Dogs is a classic film and Quentin Tarantino is just an absolute genius. I really liked this film, it was gripping and suspenseful. Straight to the point and extremely well acted. A few of the scenes were very gruesome but they needed to be. Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde was just crazy but my personal favourite in this film was Chris Penn who played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, I found him to be hilarious. The story developed at a good pace even though it was mostly set in one place with just a few flashbacks. Overall this is well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 250 list, a classic film that everyone just has to see. 9/10.

    Tarantino made a memorial debut as a director on this, Reservoir Dogs. The story is quite simple describing six robbers who call each other by color. They fail to thieve jewels and become doubtful about each other. I know this movie gains high ratings but compared with Pulp Fiction, this doesn't look as good as that. &nbsp;Although there're many great directions as ever, for me this lacks refreshment after watching. However, opening scene is cool and talk about "like a virgin" makes me laugh. Also, musics are nice. The actors Tarantino chose are always refined. Especially, I like Mr. Orange and Mr. White. Besides, Tarantino himself is attractive! In spite of skillful story-telling by moving axis of time, the important story itself fascinates me so much. &nbsp;In the middle of the movie, I became bored. Still, there're full of humor and violence. You will be satisfied with them.

    The first movie by legendary director Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of gangsters trying to work out who betrayed them to the police. Set mainly in a warehouse in the aftermath of a failed bank robbery. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth lead the fantastic ensemble, despite one of them having a bullet in there gut for all of the movie. Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi co-star as the psychotic maniac and the weaselly coward who doesn't believe in tipping. Chris Penn (who looks and sounds exactly like Jonah Hill) and Lawrence Tierney are the two minor members of the gang but make there mark on the movie and still have memorable performances. All of the actors, especially Buscemi, do a brilliant job and are one of my favourite movie line ups ever. Although it sounds quite simple at first the plot of Reservoir Dogs stems out into flashbacks and each gangsters account of what happened. Much like Tarantino's next (and best) movie Pulp Fiction, the dialogue and script is what really makes the movie a classic. Reservoir Dogs has two famous musical scenes which you will have definitely seen many parodies of even if you didn't know it. Both have retro 70's soundtracks because while all the chaos and double crossing is going on, the radio is having a Super Sounds of the 70's Weekend. Without the jazzy backing tracks neither of the most memorable scenes in the movie would be as - well - memorable. Finally the ending of the movie, which is perfect. Tarantino does the impossible and gets us to feel sorry for the evil murdering Reservoir Dogs. I give Reservoir Dogs an excellent rating of 8.9/10. Definitely in my Top 50 Movies of All Time. http://www.IMDb.com/list/AoqmUADYknU/

(I didn't differ very much from the IMDb description, so I don't believe any spoilers were revealed.) This story is very captivating, and the actors make it that way with no-bull performances. Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn were all in the early stages of their acting careers, and this movie was their big break. In fact, if Harvey Keitel hadn't agreed to produce it and star in it, it probably wouldn't have even seen the light of day; or at least it wouldn't have been as big as it is now. The script is very compelling and stylish. It gives a certain edge to the movie that made it better. A lot of this movie's dialogue has been quoted many times. My point- it was a very memorable movie. Overall, you have to see Reservoir Dogs. It is a timeless classic that defined Tarantino movies for the rest of his career. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    This movie is my favourite movie of all time, so far.. Reservoir Dogs in my opinion is one of Tarantino's greatest work, in my opinion it is no doubt the best, and therefore one of the greatest movies that will ever be made. The reasons being are that this film has so much 'style'. Every director has his/her own style, and Tarantino's style is reflected in this movie throughout every single detail. I love the fact that this takes a 'cliche' narrative (a diamond heist) and transforms it into something far more. We never even see the diamonds, it's not about the diamonds, it's about something far more important; the relationship between these men. The idea, again in my opinion is that there is no definitive good and bad. Throughout this movie I felt as though I really knew these characters, and I liked these guys. Never the less, these guys were in a sense 'bad', they killed cops, innocent men and women. They stole diamonds, and eventually killed each other. Saying all this, these guys are some of the coolest to ever be created in a film.

    Reservoir Dogs, simply put, is one of the best crime films ever made. A uniquely stylized viewpoint, combined with a colorful cast of specific and desperate characters allows this movie to live on forever in the crime genre. Trademark performances from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Harvey Kietel, Chris Penn and others give the viewer every possible perspective in a room full of thieves and ex-cons. In particularly specific conversations, the men articulate exactly what level of society they come from over cigarettes and broken balls. The search later on for the rat in the disjointed time line gives the audience something to think about and although you find out early who the cop in the crew is, you still have to follow on to see what the future holds for him. Fantastic Film.

    A bit of a clich&eacute; for those of us in college in the 1990's, but Reservoir Dogs was the movie that got me wondering what made the difference between movies I liked and movies I loved. I loved this movie. I was not able to finish watching it on a Sunday, as I had, as usual, put off tons of homework that needed immediate attention. I waited all week with Reservoir Dogs on my mind. I rented the videotape as soon as I was done with school for the week and just devoured this movie. Why did I like a movie where people just talked and talked? How could I remain on the edge of my seat with every word? What made the style of this movie so appealing? These questions led to me wanting to understand script writing, shooting and editing movies. It also was the beginning of a realization that understanding who directed a movie is key to finding movies I like. I immediately started following Quentin Tarantino's next project and was riveted by his interview with Charlie Rose and the clips of Pulp Fiction. I would see Pulp Fiction four times in the theater which was exactly twice the number of times I'd ever seen any other movie. Incredibly written, incredibly acted, and, most importantly, incredibly directed to be the kind of work that gets you forgetting it took work. I find myself just sitting and enjoying every minute.

    Reservoir Dogs is a classic Quentino Tarantino film: tough characters, non-linear storyline, lots of action, shootouts and no unnecessary shots. So that means everything is very precisely thought through. I found one theme very interesting for me in this movie and that is the alienation between the criminal team who is doing a diamond heist. Sure, criminals usually don't trust each other, but usually you have to trust a person very much if you are attempting to do a heist together. So it is quite interesting that the members of this team are deprived of their names, personality - they all are assigned names and they are all wearing the same outfit as if to say that in this heist they leave their personal lives and identities behind them and they are different people here. Although in the beginning there are many close shots as if trying to get into the personalities, trying to make you acquainted with them. Actually there is distance even between the people who have the same profession - I'm talking about the two policemen. The wide space between them suggests that even though they are in the same boat working for the same cause they are so different. One of them got in that place by mistake: he was captured and tortured. The other one got accepted to the team after he pretended that he is a criminal. Another thing which just deepens the alienation is what you can see from MR. White's example. If you get attached to someone you get punished. He trusted his hurt partner Mr Orange who apparently was a policeman and he defended him he killed his partners and then got shot himself by the police. Another great thing in this movie is the music: it is used just a few times, in the intro, credits and in the torture scene. Now in the torture scene the music is used to show distance from human emotion. The lack of music elsewhere adds the realistic sense to the movie. So this movie for me really shows how people are just working for one goal, not caring about each other, alienating each other from themselves.

    Reservior Dogs is a classic film and Quentin Tarantino is just an absolute genius. I really liked this film, it was gripping and suspenseful. Straight to the point and extremely well acted. A few of the scenes were very gruesome but they needed to be. Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde was just crazy but my personal favourite in this film was Chris Penn who played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, I found him to be hilarious. The story developed at a good pace even though it was mostly set in one place with just a few flashbacks. Overall this is well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 250 list, a classic film that everyone just has to see. 9/10.

    Tarantino made a memorial debut as a director on this, Reservoir Dogs. The story is quite simple describing six robbers who call each other by color. They fail to thieve jewels and become doubtful about each other. I know this movie gains high ratings but compared with Pulp Fiction, this doesn't look as good as that. &nbsp;Although there're many great directions as ever, for me this lacks refreshment after watching. However, opening scene is cool and talk about "like a virgin" makes me laugh. Also, musics are nice. The actors Tarantino chose are always refined. Especially, I like Mr. Orange and Mr. White. Besides, Tarantino himself is attractive! In spite of skillful story-telling by moving axis of time, the important story itself fascinates me so much. &nbsp;In the middle of the movie, I became bored. Still, there're full of humor and violence. You will be satisfied with them.

    The first movie by legendary director Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of gangsters trying to work out who betrayed them to the police. Set mainly in a warehouse in the aftermath of a failed bank robbery. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth lead the fantastic ensemble, despite one of them having a bullet in there gut for all of the movie. Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi co-star as the psychotic maniac and the weaselly coward who doesn't believe in tipping. Chris Penn (who looks and sounds exactly like Jonah Hill) and Lawrence Tierney are the two minor members of the gang but make there mark on the movie and still have memorable performances. All of the actors, especially Buscemi, do a brilliant job and are one of my favourite movie line ups ever. Although it sounds quite simple at first the plot of Reservoir Dogs stems out into flashbacks and each gangsters account of what happened. Much like Tarantino's next (and best) movie Pulp Fiction, the dialogue and script is what really makes the movie a classic. Reservoir Dogs has two famous musical scenes which you will have definitely seen many parodies of even if you didn't know it. Both have retro 70's soundtracks because while all the chaos and double crossing is going on, the radio is having a Super Sounds of the 70's Weekend. Without the jazzy backing tracks neither of the most memorable scenes in the movie would be as - well - memorable. Finally the ending of the movie, which is perfect. Tarantino does the impossible and gets us to feel sorry for the evil murdering Reservoir Dogs. I give Reservoir Dogs an excellent rating of 8.9/10. Definitely in my Top 50 Movies of All Time. http://www.IMDb.com/list/AoqmUADYknU/

    Great movie! It's about a band of guys with code names that are colors robbing a jewelry store. However, the heist goes bad and the robbers have to scatter. Slowly they meet up at the safe house to discuss what went wrong, how & why. For Tarentino's first film with a low budget, he really pulled off an amazing film. There's violence, guns, torture, and a story all thrown together beautifully! Once I first saw this film, I immediately rented Tarantino's other movies and had a marathon. Most of his other films a great, but this one knocked it outta the park! The music is also great (if you're into 70s music). The only reason I rated this a 9 instead of 10 is because there are a couple of moments where the story gets a little dull (a couple of the characters' back stories were kinda 'eh...). But the twist near the end was great. Overall, I loved it and would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes crime drama!

    Reservoir Dogs, simply put, is one of the best crime films ever made. A uniquely stylized viewpoint, combined with a colorful cast of specific and desperate characters allows this movie to live on forever in the crime genre. Trademark performances from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Harvey Kietel, Chris Penn and others give the viewer every possible perspective in a room full of thieves and ex-cons. In particularly specific conversations, the men articulate exactly what level of society they come from over cigarettes and broken balls. The search later on for the rat in the disjointed time line gives the audience something to think about and although you find out early who the cop in the crew is, you still have to follow on to see what the future holds for him. Fantastic Film.

    A bit of a clich&eacute; for those of us in college in the 1990's, but Reservoir Dogs was the movie that got me wondering what made the difference between movies I liked and movies I loved. I loved this movie. I was not able to finish watching it on a Sunday, as I had, as usual, put off tons of homework that needed immediate attention. I waited all week with Reservoir Dogs on my mind. I rented the videotape as soon as I was done with school for the week and just devoured this movie. Why did I like a movie where people just talked and talked? How could I remain on the edge of my seat with every word? What made the style of this movie so appealing? These questions led to me wanting to understand script writing, shooting and editing movies. It also was the beginning of a realization that understanding who directed a movie is key to finding movies I like. I immediately started following Quentin Tarantino's next project and was riveted by his interview with Charlie Rose and the clips of Pulp Fiction. I would see Pulp Fiction four times in the theater which was exactly twice the number of times I'd ever seen any other movie. Incredibly written, incredibly acted, and, most importantly, incredibly directed to be the kind of work that gets you forgetting it took work. I find myself just sitting and enjoying every minute.

    Reservoir Dogs is a classic Quentino Tarantino film: tough characters, non-linear storyline, lots of action, shootouts and no unnecessary shots. So that means everything is very precisely thought through. I found one theme very interesting for me in this movie and that is the alienation between the criminal team who is doing a diamond heist. Sure, criminals usually don't trust each other, but usually you have to trust a person very much if you are attempting to do a heist together. So it is quite interesting that the members of this team are deprived of their names, personality - they all are assigned names and they are all wearing the same outfit as if to say that in this heist they leave their personal lives and identities behind them and they are different people here. Although in the beginning there are many close shots as if trying to get into the personalities, trying to make you acquainted with them. Actually there is distance even between the people who have the same profession - I'm talking about the two policemen. The wide space between them suggests that even though they are in the same boat working for the same cause they are so different. One of them got in that place by mistake: he was captured and tortured. The other one got accepted to the team after he pretended that he is a criminal. Another thing which just deepens the alienation is what you can see from MR. White's example. If you get attached to someone you get punished. He trusted his hurt partner Mr Orange who apparently was a policeman and he defended him he killed his partners and then got shot himself by the police. Another great thing in this movie is the music: it is used just a few times, in the intro, credits and in the torture scene. Now in the torture scene the music is used to show distance from human emotion. The lack of music elsewhere adds the realistic sense to the movie. So this movie for me really shows how people are just working for one goal, not caring about each other, alienating each other from themselves.

    Reservior Dogs is a classic film and Quentin Tarantino is just an absolute genius. I really liked this film, it was gripping and suspenseful. Straight to the point and extremely well acted. A few of the scenes were very gruesome but they needed to be. Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde was just crazy but my personal favourite in this film was Chris Penn who played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, I found him to be hilarious. The story developed at a good pace even though it was mostly set in one place with just a few flashbacks. Overall this is well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 250 list, a classic film that everyone just has to see. 9/10.

    Tarantino made a memorial debut as a director on this, Reservoir Dogs. The story is quite simple describing six robbers who call each other by color. They fail to thieve jewels and become doubtful about each other. I know this movie gains high ratings but compared with Pulp Fiction, this doesn't look as good as that. &nbsp;Although there're many great directions as ever, for me this lacks refreshment after watching. However, opening scene is cool and talk about "like a virgin" makes me laugh. Also, musics are nice. The actors Tarantino chose are always refined. Especially, I like Mr. Orange and Mr. White. Besides, Tarantino himself is attractive! In spite of skillful story-telling by moving axis of time, the important story itself fascinates me so much. &nbsp;In the middle of the movie, I became bored. Still, there're full of humor and violence. You will be satisfied with them.

    The first movie by legendary director Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of gangsters trying to work out who betrayed them to the police. Set mainly in a warehouse in the aftermath of a failed bank robbery. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth lead the fantastic ensemble, despite one of them having a bullet in there gut for all of the movie. Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi co-star as the psychotic maniac and the weaselly coward who doesn't believe in tipping. Chris Penn (who looks and sounds exactly like Jonah Hill) and Lawrence Tierney are the two minor members of the gang but make there mark on the movie and still have memorable performances. All of the actors, especially Buscemi, do a brilliant job and are one of my favourite movie line ups ever. Although it sounds quite simple at first the plot of Reservoir Dogs stems out into flashbacks and each gangsters account of what happened. Much like Tarantino's next (and best) movie Pulp Fiction, the dialogue and script is what really makes the movie a classic. Reservoir Dogs has two famous musical scenes which you will have definitely seen many parodies of even if you didn't know it. Both have retro 70's soundtracks because while all the chaos and double crossing is going on, the radio is having a Super Sounds of the 70's Weekend. Without the jazzy backing tracks neither of the most memorable scenes in the movie would be as - well - memorable. Finally the ending of the movie, which is perfect. Tarantino does the impossible and gets us to feel sorry for the evil murdering Reservoir Dogs. I give Reservoir Dogs an excellent rating of 8.9/10. Definitely in my Top 50 Movies of All Time. http://www.IMDb.com/list/AoqmUADYknU/

    Great movie! It's about a band of guys with code names that are colors robbing a jewelry store. However, the heist goes bad and the robbers have to scatter. Slowly they meet up at the safe house to discuss what went wrong, how & why. For Tarentino's first film with a low budget, he really pulled off an amazing film. There's violence, guns, torture, and a story all thrown together beautifully! Once I first saw this film, I immediately rented Tarantino's other movies and had a marathon. Most of his other films a great, but this one knocked it outta the park! The music is also great (if you're into 70s music). The only reason I rated this a 9 instead of 10 is because there are a couple of moments where the story gets a little dull (a couple of the characters' back stories were kinda 'eh...). But the twist near the end was great. Overall, I loved it and would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes crime drama!

    Review #4 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews I'm just gonna go ahead and say it: I think this movie is better than Pulp Fiction. Unlike most of the Tarantino fans, I think this movie was a little bit better than Pulp. I just liked the story and characters more. Anyway, let me talk about THIS movie. Reservoir Dogs is a timeless classic. There are no smartphones, iPads, or laptops. Just good old fashioned killing. No spoilers, the story is about a group of men who are pulling off a bank heist. But when it goes terribly wrong, they think they have a rat working for the police in their midst. This is followed by paranoia, suspicion, and rage. (I didn't differ very much from the IMDb description, so I don't believe any spoilers were revealed.) This story is very captivating, and the actors make it that way with no-bull performances. Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn were all in the early stages of their acting careers, and this movie was their big break. In fact, if Harvey Keitel hadn't agreed to produce it and star in it, it probably wouldn't have even seen the light of day; or at least it wouldn't have been as big as it is now. The script is very compelling and stylish. It gives a certain edge to the movie that made it better. A lot of this movie's dialogue has been quoted many times. My point- it was a very memorable movie. Overall, you have to see Reservoir Dogs. It is a timeless classic that defined Tarantino movies for the rest of his career. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    This movie is my favourite movie of all time, so far.. Reservoir Dogs in my opinion is one of Tarantino's greatest work, in my opinion it is no doubt the best, and therefore one of the greatest movies that will ever be made. The reasons being are that this film has so much 'style'. Every director has his/her own style, and Tarantino's style is reflected in this movie throughout every single detail. I love the fact that this takes a 'cliche' narrative (a diamond heist) and transforms it into something far more. We never even see the diamonds, it's not about the diamonds, it's about something far more important; the relationship between these men. The idea, again in my opinion is that there is no definitive good and bad. Throughout this movie I felt as though I really knew these characters, and I liked these guys. Never the less, these guys were in a sense 'bad', they killed cops, innocent men and women. They stole diamonds, and eventually killed each other. Saying all this, these guys are some of the coolest to ever be created in a film.
