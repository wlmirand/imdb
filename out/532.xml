    This is, hands down, the most underrated brilliant movie I've seen. Indira verma has acted with such perfection, sad that it never got the recognition it deserved. The title always made me think of it as an erotica based on the ancient book of kamasutra but i was blown away by the depth of story.I highly recommend people to see this movie. Meera nair's genius is undeniable. The subtlety with which she portrays her vision through the movie is commendable. Its hard to believe it was Indira Verma's first movie, not only does she look absolutely exotic and breathtaking her skills as an actor are equally enticing. Supporting her amazing performance are equally commendable ones by Naveen Andrews and Sarita Choudhury.

    The movie does not do justice to India, nor women. It feels weird to watch it, as if someone tore up random pages from the script and just filmed what was left. As for the erotic recommendations, they do not meet their match, probably those belong to people who are compelled to associate the word "Kamasutra" with sensuality and eroticism, without bothering to actually see the movie for what it is. The central character is very unclear: what are Maya's relationships with the other girl and all the women from the palace she grew up in? What is the purpose of the disturbing hunchback elderly man that seems to love her, yet ends up by calling her a whore? It is incredible how much babble about sex and love we have to sit through without any real story about either of them.overall, what is the purpose of this entire movie? The "bad" prince (N.Andrews)is more convincing than the lover/sculptor, who purposelessly waves his long hair around; somebody must have miscasted the actors... Maya is an unlikely mix of good naive girl and extremely sex driven fox, what is this bouillabaisse?? Only French movies manage to create such confusions, yet this claims to be a movie representing India.Very disappointing. The fight, the ending, the girl...they are just not making sense. As for the sexual tension, old school Bollywood movies managed to create more without even featuring any nudity. So, see it or not see it...depending on how much time you have to waste.

    I highly recommend this film: --Indira Varma is a superb actress. It's a shame that she did not go on to more lead roles in good films; she certainly deserved them. Naveen Andrews is also very believable in his role as the dissolute king. In some of the minor parts, the acting is weak but, fortunately, the good actors have most of the lines. --The sumptuous production values are phenomenal, considering the film was made for only 3 million $US. The scenery and costumes are fascinating, considering that the setting is a few (or several even) centuries ago. --Of course, the sex scenes are great. In the video, at least, they go a bit farther than your typical R rated (in the U.S.) movie. --The screenplay has some serious weaknesses. But, if one "suspends disbelief", there are some interesting notions presented: the intermingling of love and sex, with some lessons from the text of the 'Kama Sutra'; the fate of women in a man's world; how royalty behaved in feudal India. See the 'memorable quotes' section for more. --It is not typical "feel good" schlock. The ending has a realistic feel to it. Verisimilitude is relatively high, which is all too rare in the movie industry, in general.

    I came across this film quite randomly and expected something pretty intolerable, but with bewbs. Instead, I got beautiful cinematography and arresting visual content behind a very candid study of the difficulties of navigating human desire. Even in a culture with clear conventions and few inhibitions regarding the acts of love, relationships advance by trial-and-error, defying the participants' intents and expectations, elevating some while trampling others underfoot. The film at once delivers the exotic with its costumes, sets and dancing, and tells a timeless and easily recognizable human tale. Also, some very beautiful people take off their clothes =D

The lead Indira Verma, although stunningly beautiful, is a very bad actress and mistakes posturing for acting. Vetern Hindi film actress Rekha is essentially wasted in a throw-away role as an elderly courtesan who teaches nubile nymphets the art of 'pleasang their man'. Yes, it is as yucky as it sounds, and unfortunately not treated with the campiness it deserves. Worth avoiding. Overall 3/10

    To be honest, only the thought that it would have quite a bit of sex, and the leading actor in it was what made me want to see it, that's all. You'd probably expect the film to be about various positions during sex, but the title actually means "lessons of love", and there's nothing various about that. The story, as far as I understood, is set in the 16th Century of India, where Prince Raj Singh (Lost's Naveen Andrews) is bored, and to entertain himself wants a lot of women action, if you know what I mean. During this, there is betrayal, secret love, jealousy, and all the complications you can think of in relationships. And yes, a few sex scenes along the way. Also starring Sarita Choudhury as Tara, Ramon Tikaram as Jai Kumar, Rekha as Rasa Devi, Indira Varma as Maya, Pearl Padamsee as Maham Anga and Arundhati Rao as Annabi. As I said, just the sex and the leading actor were the only things that interested me. Okay!

    Expected a lot more from the maker of Salaam Bombay. Bought a DVD version of the movie in Canada with a sequel from Mira Nair herself. She babbled erotic scenes and melodramatic sequences are a must to the story. But where is the storyline here? At best she has exploited the flesh of then beautiful women in the world Indra Verma. In Mira Nair rates herself as the purveyor of women liberation and wanna highlight the plight of a servant girl in the medieval India, whats the point in those surrogate scenes? Still cannot figure out why this movie was labeled Kamasutra. A billion dollar question even the director cannot answer

    My favorite movie of all time. The colors, the tragic plot, the actors make this movie a perfect choice. The story of two girls from different social societies, one ends up queen the other a cortesan. The unique plot makes you sit at the edge of your chair for more. The twists and transitions are perfect from scene to scene. It leaves a good message with you. The sex scenes are real and hot. Contrary to the title, there is very little sex, but just enough to stir your mind. My all time favorite and i will sit and watch it again and again.

    If a simple embrace between Richard Gere and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty caused all that furor, it is no wonder that this film is banned in India and Pakistan. I really don't feel completely qualified to judge this film as it is the first Indian film I have seen, and probably wouldn't even have tuned in except to see Lost's Naveen Andrews, who played the King. As Mel Brooks said, "It's good to be the King." He sits around smoking opium and has a nice harem, which included Maya (Indira Varma). I thought she was hot in the short-lived TV show 3 lbs. She is even hotter here and I can see why the King lost it over her. Sarita Choudhury plays the Queen and childhood rival of Maya. She starred with Denzel Washington in Mississippi Masala. The costumes and cinematography were outstanding.

    If you are looking for a love story; you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a happy ending; you will be disappointed. I was so let down by the time this movie ended- I had a sick feeling as the credits rolled. The fact that there is NO happy conclusion to what occurs throughout and, in fact no ending at all. Yes the scenic part of the film was beautiful- but for that, we could have watched a travel channel and gotten the same benefit. There is such a feeling of unfinished business as it goes off, it kills any good points of the film. There is quite a bit of sexual content; mostly what men believe women would like; but as usual its just a mans fantasy of what they would like. I won't discourage anyone from watching it. Naturally, everyone should have an equal opportunity to be let down. In my opinion, the film's main message is take what sexual opportunities come to you in life, because nothing in life is likely to work out in the end. In the end, all we know is "she is the wind" which still left a lot of questions unanswered.

    To be honest, only the thought that it would have quite a bit of sex, and the leading actor in it was what made me want to see it, that's all. You'd probably expect the film to be about various positions during sex, but the title actually means "lessons of love", and there's nothing various about that. The story, as far as I understood, is set in the 16th Century of India, where Prince Raj Singh (Lost's Naveen Andrews) is bored, and to entertain himself wants a lot of women action, if you know what I mean. During this, there is betrayal, secret love, jealousy, and all the complications you can think of in relationships. And yes, a few sex scenes along the way. Also starring Sarita Choudhury as Tara, Ramon Tikaram as Jai Kumar, Rekha as Rasa Devi, Indira Varma as Maya, Pearl Padamsee as Maham Anga and Arundhati Rao as Annabi. As I said, just the sex and the leading actor were the only things that interested me. Okay!

    Expected a lot more from the maker of Salaam Bombay. Bought a DVD version of the movie in Canada with a sequel from Mira Nair herself. She babbled erotic scenes and melodramatic sequences are a must to the story. But where is the storyline here? At best she has exploited the flesh of then beautiful women in the world Indra Verma. In Mira Nair rates herself as the purveyor of women liberation and wanna highlight the plight of a servant girl in the medieval India, whats the point in those surrogate scenes? Still cannot figure out why this movie was labeled Kamasutra. A billion dollar question even the director cannot answer

    My favorite movie of all time. The colors, the tragic plot, the actors make this movie a perfect choice. The story of two girls from different social societies, one ends up queen the other a cortesan. The unique plot makes you sit at the edge of your chair for more. The twists and transitions are perfect from scene to scene. It leaves a good message with you. The sex scenes are real and hot. Contrary to the title, there is very little sex, but just enough to stir your mind. My all time favorite and i will sit and watch it again and again.

    If a simple embrace between Richard Gere and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty caused all that furor, it is no wonder that this film is banned in India and Pakistan. I really don't feel completely qualified to judge this film as it is the first Indian film I have seen, and probably wouldn't even have tuned in except to see Lost's Naveen Andrews, who played the King. As Mel Brooks said, "It's good to be the King." He sits around smoking opium and has a nice harem, which included Maya (Indira Varma). I thought she was hot in the short-lived TV show 3 lbs. She is even hotter here and I can see why the King lost it over her. Sarita Choudhury plays the Queen and childhood rival of Maya. She starred with Denzel Washington in Mississippi Masala. The costumes and cinematography were outstanding.

    If you are looking for a love story; you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a happy ending; you will be disappointed. I was so let down by the time this movie ended- I had a sick feeling as the credits rolled. The fact that there is NO happy conclusion to what occurs throughout and, in fact no ending at all. Yes the scenic part of the film was beautiful- but for that, we could have watched a travel channel and gotten the same benefit. There is such a feeling of unfinished business as it goes off, it kills any good points of the film. There is quite a bit of sexual content; mostly what men believe women would like; but as usual its just a mans fantasy of what they would like. I won't discourage anyone from watching it. Naturally, everyone should have an equal opportunity to be let down. In my opinion, the film's main message is take what sexual opportunities come to you in life, because nothing in life is likely to work out in the end. In the end, all we know is "she is the wind" which still left a lot of questions unanswered.

    This is, hands down, the most underrated brilliant movie I've seen. Indira verma has acted with such perfection, sad that it never got the recognition it deserved. The title always made me think of it as an erotica based on the ancient book of kamasutra but i was blown away by the depth of story.I highly recommend people to see this movie. Meera nair's genius is undeniable. The subtlety with which she portrays her vision through the movie is commendable. Its hard to believe it was Indira Verma's first movie, not only does she look absolutely exotic and breathtaking her skills as an actor are equally enticing. Supporting her amazing performance are equally commendable ones by Naveen Andrews and Sarita Choudhury.

    The movie does not do justice to India, nor women. It feels weird to watch it, as if someone tore up random pages from the script and just filmed what was left. As for the erotic recommendations, they do not meet their match, probably those belong to people who are compelled to associate the word "Kamasutra" with sensuality and eroticism, without bothering to actually see the movie for what it is. The central character is very unclear: what are Maya's relationships with the other girl and all the women from the palace she grew up in? What is the purpose of the disturbing hunchback elderly man that seems to love her, yet ends up by calling her a whore? It is incredible how much babble about sex and love we have to sit through without any real story about either of them.overall, what is the purpose of this entire movie? The "bad" prince (N.Andrews)is more convincing than the lover/sculptor, who purposelessly waves his long hair around; somebody must have miscasted the actors... Maya is an unlikely mix of good naive girl and extremely sex driven fox, what is this bouillabaisse?? Only French movies manage to create such confusions, yet this claims to be a movie representing India.Very disappointing. The fight, the ending, the girl...they are just not making sense. As for the sexual tension, old school Bollywood movies managed to create more without even featuring any nudity. So, see it or not see it...depending on how much time you have to waste.

    I highly recommend this film: --Indira Varma is a superb actress. It's a shame that she did not go on to more lead roles in good films; she certainly deserved them. Naveen Andrews is also very believable in his role as the dissolute king. In some of the minor parts, the acting is weak but, fortunately, the good actors have most of the lines. --The sumptuous production values are phenomenal, considering the film was made for only 3 million $US. The scenery and costumes are fascinating, considering that the setting is a few (or several even) centuries ago. --Of course, the sex scenes are great. In the video, at least, they go a bit farther than your typical R rated (in the U.S.) movie. --The screenplay has some serious weaknesses. But, if one "suspends disbelief", there are some interesting notions presented: the intermingling of love and sex, with some lessons from the text of the 'Kama Sutra'; the fate of women in a man's world; how royalty behaved in feudal India. See the 'memorable quotes' section for more. --It is not typical "feel good" schlock. The ending has a realistic feel to it. Verisimilitude is relatively high, which is all too rare in the movie industry, in general.

    I came across this film quite randomly and expected something pretty intolerable, but with bewbs. Instead, I got beautiful cinematography and arresting visual content behind a very candid study of the difficulties of navigating human desire. Even in a culture with clear conventions and few inhibitions regarding the acts of love, relationships advance by trial-and-error, defying the participants' intents and expectations, elevating some while trampling others underfoot. The film at once delivers the exotic with its costumes, sets and dancing, and tells a timeless and easily recognizable human tale. Also, some very beautiful people take off their clothes =D

    I found this film preposterous and not in a good way. A clich&eacute;d plot involving kings and queens in ancient India is a feeble excuse to engage in a soft core melodrama. The lead Indira Verma, although stunningly beautiful, is a very bad actress and mistakes posturing for acting. Vetern Hindi film actress Rekha is essentially wasted in a throw-away role as an elderly courtesan who teaches nubile nymphets the art of 'pleasang their man'. Yes, it is as yucky as it sounds, and unfortunately not treated with the campiness it deserves. Worth avoiding. Overall 3/10

Maya is an unlikely mix of good naive girl and extremely sex driven fox, what is this bouillabaisse?? Only French movies manage to create such confusions, yet this claims to be a movie representing India.Very disappointing. The fight, the ending, the girl...they are just not making sense. As for the sexual tension, old school Bollywood movies managed to create more without even featuring any nudity. So, see it or not see it...depending on how much time you have to waste.

    I highly recommend this film: --Indira Varma is a superb actress. It's a shame that she did not go on to more lead roles in good films; she certainly deserved them. Naveen Andrews is also very believable in his role as the dissolute king. In some of the minor parts, the acting is weak but, fortunately, the good actors have most of the lines. --The sumptuous production values are phenomenal, considering the film was made for only 3 million $US. The scenery and costumes are fascinating, considering that the setting is a few (or several even) centuries ago. --Of course, the sex scenes are great. In the video, at least, they go a bit farther than your typical R rated (in the U.S.) movie. --The screenplay has some serious weaknesses. But, if one "suspends disbelief", there are some interesting notions presented: the intermingling of love and sex, with some lessons from the text of the 'Kama Sutra'; the fate of women in a man's world; how royalty behaved in feudal India. See the 'memorable quotes' section for more. --It is not typical "feel good" schlock. The ending has a realistic feel to it. Verisimilitude is relatively high, which is all too rare in the movie industry, in general.

    I came across this film quite randomly and expected something pretty intolerable, but with bewbs. Instead, I got beautiful cinematography and arresting visual content behind a very candid study of the difficulties of navigating human desire. Even in a culture with clear conventions and few inhibitions regarding the acts of love, relationships advance by trial-and-error, defying the participants' intents and expectations, elevating some while trampling others underfoot. The film at once delivers the exotic with its costumes, sets and dancing, and tells a timeless and easily recognizable human tale. Also, some very beautiful people take off their clothes =D

    I found this film preposterous and not in a good way. A clich&eacute;d plot involving kings and queens in ancient India is a feeble excuse to engage in a soft core melodrama. The lead Indira Verma, although stunningly beautiful, is a very bad actress and mistakes posturing for acting. Vetern Hindi film actress Rekha is essentially wasted in a throw-away role as an elderly courtesan who teaches nubile nymphets the art of 'pleasang their man'. Yes, it is as yucky as it sounds, and unfortunately not treated with the campiness it deserves. Worth avoiding. Overall 3/10

    To be honest, only the thought that it would have quite a bit of sex, and the leading actor in it was what made me want to see it, that's all. You'd probably expect the film to be about various positions during sex, but the title actually means "lessons of love", and there's nothing various about that. The story, as far as I understood, is set in the 16th Century of India, where Prince Raj Singh (Lost's Naveen Andrews) is bored, and to entertain himself wants a lot of women action, if you know what I mean. During this, there is betrayal, secret love, jealousy, and all the complications you can think of in relationships. And yes, a few sex scenes along the way. Also starring Sarita Choudhury as Tara, Ramon Tikaram as Jai Kumar, Rekha as Rasa Devi, Indira Varma as Maya, Pearl Padamsee as Maham Anga and Arundhati Rao as Annabi. As I said, just the sex and the leading actor were the only things that interested me. Okay!

    Expected a lot more from the maker of Salaam Bombay. Bought a DVD version of the movie in Canada with a sequel from Mira Nair herself. She babbled erotic scenes and melodramatic sequences are a must to the story. But where is the storyline here? At best she has exploited the flesh of then beautiful women in the world Indra Verma. In Mira Nair rates herself as the purveyor of women liberation and wanna highlight the plight of a servant girl in the medieval India, whats the point in those surrogate scenes? Still cannot figure out why this movie was labeled Kamasutra. A billion dollar question even the director cannot answer

    My favorite movie of all time. The colors, the tragic plot, the actors make this movie a perfect choice. The story of two girls from different social societies, one ends up queen the other a cortesan. The unique plot makes you sit at the edge of your chair for more. The twists and transitions are perfect from scene to scene. It leaves a good message with you. The sex scenes are real and hot. Contrary to the title, there is very little sex, but just enough to stir your mind. My all time favorite and i will sit and watch it again and again.

    If a simple embrace between Richard Gere and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty caused all that furor, it is no wonder that this film is banned in India and Pakistan. I really don't feel completely qualified to judge this film as it is the first Indian film I have seen, and probably wouldn't even have tuned in except to see Lost's Naveen Andrews, who played the King. As Mel Brooks said, "It's good to be the King." He sits around smoking opium and has a nice harem, which included Maya (Indira Varma). I thought she was hot in the short-lived TV show 3 lbs. She is even hotter here and I can see why the King lost it over her. Sarita Choudhury plays the Queen and childhood rival of Maya. She starred with Denzel Washington in Mississippi Masala. The costumes and cinematography were outstanding.

    If you are looking for a love story; you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a happy ending; you will be disappointed. I was so let down by the time this movie ended- I had a sick feeling as the credits rolled. The fact that there is NO happy conclusion to what occurs throughout and, in fact no ending at all. Yes the scenic part of the film was beautiful- but for that, we could have watched a travel channel and gotten the same benefit. There is such a feeling of unfinished business as it goes off, it kills any good points of the film. There is quite a bit of sexual content; mostly what men believe women would like; but as usual its just a mans fantasy of what they would like. I won't discourage anyone from watching it. Naturally, everyone should have an equal opportunity to be let down. In my opinion, the film's main message is take what sexual opportunities come to you in life, because nothing in life is likely to work out in the end. In the end, all we know is "she is the wind" which still left a lot of questions unanswered.

    This is, hands down, the most underrated brilliant movie I've seen. Indira verma has acted with such perfection, sad that it never got the recognition it deserved. The title always made me think of it as an erotica based on the ancient book of kamasutra but i was blown away by the depth of story.I highly recommend people to see this movie. Meera nair's genius is undeniable. The subtlety with which she portrays her vision through the movie is commendable. Its hard to believe it was Indira Verma's first movie, not only does she look absolutely exotic and breathtaking her skills as an actor are equally enticing. Supporting her amazing performance are equally commendable ones by Naveen Andrews and Sarita Choudhury.

    The movie does not do justice to India, nor women. It feels weird to watch it, as if someone tore up random pages from the script and just filmed what was left. As for the erotic recommendations, they do not meet their match, probably those belong to people who are compelled to associate the word "Kamasutra" with sensuality and eroticism, without bothering to actually see the movie for what it is. The central character is very unclear: what are Maya's relationships with the other girl and all the women from the palace she grew up in? What is the purpose of the disturbing hunchback elderly man that seems to love her, yet ends up by calling her a whore? It is incredible how much babble about sex and love we have to sit through without any real story about either of them.overall, what is the purpose of this entire movie?

    This is, hands down, the most underrated brilliant movie I've seen. Indira verma has acted with such perfection, sad that it never got the recognition it deserved. The title always made me think of it as an erotica based on the ancient book of kamasutra but i was blown away by the depth of story.I highly recommend people to see this movie. Meera nair's genius is undeniable. The subtlety with which she portrays her vision through the movie is commendable. Its hard to believe it was Indira Verma's first movie, not only does she look absolutely exotic and breathtaking her skills as an actor are equally enticing. Supporting her amazing performance are equally commendable ones by Naveen Andrews and Sarita Choudhury.

    The movie does not do justice to India, nor women. It feels weird to watch it, as if someone tore up random pages from the script and just filmed what was left. As for the erotic recommendations, they do not meet their match, probably those belong to people who are compelled to associate the word "Kamasutra" with sensuality and eroticism, without bothering to actually see the movie for what it is. The central character is very unclear: what are Maya's relationships with the other girl and all the women from the palace she grew up in? What is the purpose of the disturbing hunchback elderly man that seems to love her, yet ends up by calling her a whore? It is incredible how much babble about sex and love we have to sit through without any real story about either of them.overall, what is the purpose of this entire movie? The "bad" prince (N.Andrews)is more convincing than the lover/sculptor, who purposelessly waves his long hair around; somebody must have miscasted the actors... Maya is an unlikely mix of good naive girl and extremely sex driven fox, what is this bouillabaisse?? Only French movies manage to create such confusions, yet this claims to be a movie representing India.Very disappointing. The fight, the ending, the girl...they are just not making sense. As for the sexual tension, old school Bollywood movies managed to create more without even featuring any nudity. So, see it or not see it...depending on how much time you have to waste.

    I highly recommend this film: --Indira Varma is a superb actress. It's a shame that she did not go on to more lead roles in good films; she certainly deserved them. Naveen Andrews is also very believable in his role as the dissolute king. In some of the minor parts, the acting is weak but, fortunately, the good actors have most of the lines. --The sumptuous production values are phenomenal, considering the film was made for only 3 million $US. The scenery and costumes are fascinating, considering that the setting is a few (or several even) centuries ago. --Of course, the sex scenes are great. In the video, at least, they go a bit farther than your typical R rated (in the U.S.) movie. --The screenplay has some serious weaknesses. But, if one "suspends disbelief", there are some interesting notions presented: the intermingling of love and sex, with some lessons from the text of the 'Kama Sutra'; the fate of women in a man's world; how royalty behaved in feudal India. See the 'memorable quotes' section for more. --It is not typical "feel good" schlock. The ending has a realistic feel to it. Verisimilitude is relatively high, which is all too rare in the movie industry, in general.

    I came across this film quite randomly and expected something pretty intolerable, but with bewbs. Instead, I got beautiful cinematography and arresting visual content behind a very candid study of the difficulties of navigating human desire. Even in a culture with clear conventions and few inhibitions regarding the acts of love, relationships advance by trial-and-error, defying the participants' intents and expectations, elevating some while trampling others underfoot. The film at once delivers the exotic with its costumes, sets and dancing, and tells a timeless and easily recognizable human tale. Also, some very beautiful people take off their clothes =D

    I found this film preposterous and not in a good way. A clich&eacute;d plot involving kings and queens in ancient India is a feeble excuse to engage in a soft core melodrama. The lead Indira Verma, although stunningly beautiful, is a very bad actress and mistakes posturing for acting. Vetern Hindi film actress Rekha is essentially wasted in a throw-away role as an elderly courtesan who teaches nubile nymphets the art of 'pleasang their man'. Yes, it is as yucky as it sounds, and unfortunately not treated with the campiness it deserves. Worth avoiding. Overall 3/10

    To be honest, only the thought that it would have quite a bit of sex, and the leading actor in it was what made me want to see it, that's all. You'd probably expect the film to be about various positions during sex, but the title actually means "lessons of love", and there's nothing various about that. The story, as far as I understood, is set in the 16th Century of India, where Prince Raj Singh (Lost's Naveen Andrews) is bored, and to entertain himself wants a lot of women action, if you know what I mean. During this, there is betrayal, secret love, jealousy, and all the complications you can think of in relationships. And yes, a few sex scenes along the way. Also starring Sarita Choudhury as Tara, Ramon Tikaram as Jai Kumar, Rekha as Rasa Devi, Indira Varma as Maya, Pearl Padamsee as Maham Anga and Arundhati Rao as Annabi. As I said, just the sex and the leading actor were the only things that interested me. Okay!

    Expected a lot more from the maker of Salaam Bombay. Bought a DVD version of the movie in Canada with a sequel from Mira Nair herself. She babbled erotic scenes and melodramatic sequences are a must to the story. But where is the storyline here? At best she has exploited the flesh of then beautiful women in the world Indra Verma. In Mira Nair rates herself as the purveyor of women liberation and wanna highlight the plight of a servant girl in the medieval India, whats the point in those surrogate scenes? Still cannot figure out why this movie was labeled Kamasutra. A billion dollar question even the director cannot answer

    My favorite movie of all time. The colors, the tragic plot, the actors make this movie a perfect choice. The story of two girls from different social societies, one ends up queen the other a cortesan. The unique plot makes you sit at the edge of your chair for more. The twists and transitions are perfect from scene to scene. It leaves a good message with you. The sex scenes are real and hot. Contrary to the title, there is very little sex, but just enough to stir your mind. My all time favorite and i will sit and watch it again and again.

    If you are looking for a love story; you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a happy ending; you will be disappointed. I was so let down by the time this movie ended- I had a sick feeling as the credits rolled. The fact that there is NO happy conclusion to what occurs throughout and, in fact no ending at all. Yes the scenic part of the film was beautiful- but for that, we could have watched a travel channel and gotten the same benefit. There is such a feeling of unfinished business as it goes off, it kills any good points of the film. There is quite a bit of sexual content; mostly what men believe women would like; but as usual its just a mans fantasy of what they would like. I won't discourage anyone from watching it.
