    It. The humanity. In the first case I did not like his outlook and in the second, I did not like her name. Otherwise brilliant play. Playful, interesting, my first of this kind and with very good sound-track. Very good historical retrospective told in its cultural context also. Kingdom with a queen, society of men, poetry, science, adventures, future, windy job, time for conscious choice. High level of abstractness that gets down to the contemporary viewer through different big talks. With the purpose to show him what he looked like, what he is now and to be asked what he wants to be for now on. Historical load showed to us as being left aside the road. Not forgotten. One of the possible ones but came real. More social concepts in the rubric "it happened like this". Again, interesting, moving. Lovely surprise and amusement.

    I red -some praise "acting" of Tilda. THose folks doesn't know anything about acting to write that. when i come across of such "works of art"- I think of millions people and other creatures of the world who r in trouble and starving. And those people who r responsible of funding this nonsense, instead of spending money wisely and humanely. So much money goes to fund crap like that. Again n again, this "movie" is perfect example. Yuck to EVERYTHING about this piece of crap. Yucky people are who waste money this way. What about those who gave some better reviews to "this"? They r loonies and should be very ashamed of themselves.

    Tilda Swinton as a man does require a certain denial. She is female lets not deny it. She is not the epitome of femininity but that is not a detraction from the person she portrays. She is plain but from start to finish she is not asexual far from it. She is rounded in her portrayal of Orlando except in the minor aspect of the deficiency in anger that is found in many men or to be more precise the denial of their expectations and acceptance of the reality with which they are met. However, his/her characters adaptability and acceptance of reality despite the negatives of choosing a such a crippled sex in that age is what defines her inherent female persona from start to finish. Quentin Crisp knowing his personal history is the epitome of queen and Billy Zanes acceptance of Orlando for the person that he/she is shows that his nature while that of a hero does not typify a gender pre-requisite stereotype. This is a beautifully rendered film with a delicate touch and attention to detail not just of England's mini ice age but of a richer tapestry that skates just above below the ice. When watching it you are scared to intrude as everything feels so fragile however the warmth, endurance and re-creation of Orlando as a life affirming force of nature is what makes this experience so robust. If anything it says that gender is not the issue but the the will of the individual to move forward in life despite the illusions and obstacles that society presents as the norm. If I have any negative comments on the movie is that it should have been longer and filled in the gaps that were obvious in the life of anyone who is over 400 years old as it fails to emphasize the tearing and pain that such inherent change entails.

The film itself also has a very moody tone, and it's pretty great in its first act. Although I don't think it's a drastic step down in the last two acts, it does finally settle on just being very good. But really, Swinton owns this. In fact, Swinton has the knack to be able to convey so much with her one still expression, one that can make us feel and understand what her characters are feeling. She's amazing here, and she's one of the best actresses alive. Let's just be grateful we have her.

    The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Not having read the book it is based on, I couldn't understand things such as why the Orlando character kept changing from womens to mens clothes. Now I have seen it 4-5 times in total and I've got it on DVD. On repeated viewings I have managed to catch the story and I find it to have a profound depth. Orlando is at the same time the main character and not really a part of this world. He/she goes through the centuries trying to connect to people but at the same time being different and separated from them, as if caught in a glass bubble. Not until Orlando becomes a mother, he/she truly becomes a part of this world. It is not a movie for everyone. If you want a "good film", i.e. something easily digestible, you might not like it or even hate it. If you are prepared to be open and let the movie "sink into you", you might like it very much. I would give the movie itself an 8. The uniqueness of the movie and how it lingers in my mind after watching it, and how it improves on each viewing makes me give it a 10.

    If a man had directed Orlando, would Orlando have been cast as a man instead of a woman? If a man had directed Orlando, would the Bronski Beat singer ended the film? Hollywood hates women. It's a man's world. Even now, Kathryn Bigelow is probably one of the few female directors. If a man had directed Orlando, shot for shot, the director of the Orlando we know today would have been hailed the next Stanley Kubrick. Rather, for twenty years, this masterpiece has lingered, without adequate recognition. Hopefully someday it will get the recognition it deserves. Unfortunately, like Derek Jarman, you will have to hunt out the film. I guess that is the curse of any great piece of art.

    This movie is about an hour and a half of staring at Tilda Swinton as she stares back at you. Saying that Orlando turned into a woman because he couldn't handle killing another human being is retarded. Women kill people too. They have been doing it as long as men have. I love the book, love it, and I am usually quite open to loose adaptation, but this is one case where the director was in love with showing the different time periods and had skewed ideas about gender. I understand that the book is odd, that it isn't the most cinematic, but maybe that's why the director/writer should have let this project alone. Having Tilda Swinton stare at the camera every five minutes did not add to any themes or ideas, nor did it enhance the plot. It was just creepy and slow moving. Also, what was with the weird singing angel at the end? I mean, what could that have possibly meant? P.S. I wanted a Fly Loo scene.

    As someone who knows nothing at all about Virginia Woolf and her writing career, I found this film rather vacuous. Sure the costumes and sets were great, I do love much of those eras clothing styles, but that hardly makes a great film. Hollywood has this thing with books and IMHO if you need to know the book prior to seeing the movie then the movie is at fault either the screenwriter or director failed to make a film that can stand on its own. Maybe it was an impossible task I don't know since I haven't read the book. Too much seems to depend upon knowing the author and her relationship with her friend but without that foreknowledge it loses any irony or bite. Tilde Swinson simply cannot make a convincing male and for 2/3 of the movie that simply got in the way.

    Orlando! The human predicament incarnated in a poetic piece of art. The movie is far from being entertaining; however, I couldn't get rid of that urge to watch it twice and thrice because it simply challenged my mind. For me, it was like reading a beautifully rhymed poem in a strange language. I had to see it more than once to understand every word, every gesture, every look. An in the process, I discover something new. Despite the strong feminist undertones, the movie generally ponders on the human existence presented by the tiresias-like symbolic figure Orlando, the androgynous lord who lives for more than four centuries discovering the true nature of death, love, poetry, politics, society, and sex. Orlando is a must-see if you want to keep your mind buzzing for days. One important lesson I learned from this movie: Tilda Swinton is an acting goddess!

    Sally Potter's Orlando is a clever and ambitious dissection of love and gender that defies culturally sexed expectations in both content and form. The film owes much of its narrative experimentalism to Virginia Woolf, who first conceived the story of immortal, androgynous Orlando as an exploration of societal prejudice and conduct, satirizing naively patriarchal feelings of romantic ownership and the laughably self- important status of masculine art. Potter deserves credit, however, for translating the story into a Brechtian subversion of traditional viewership modes: the film's drag casting, fourth wall disruption, titles and music all remind us to be conscious and critical of how we engage the film. Orlando is anchored by a charming performance from Tilda Swinton, and some stunning costume and set design. It is a smart film that challenges the sexed gaze, and it genuinely earns the sense of hope it ends on. -TK 10/12/10

    The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Not having read the book it is based on, I couldn't understand things such as why the Orlando character kept changing from womens to mens clothes. Now I have seen it 4-5 times in total and I've got it on DVD. On repeated viewings I have managed to catch the story and I find it to have a profound depth. Orlando is at the same time the main character and not really a part of this world. He/she goes through the centuries trying to connect to people but at the same time being different and separated from them, as if caught in a glass bubble. Not until Orlando becomes a mother, he/she truly becomes a part of this world. It is not a movie for everyone. If you want a "good film", i.e. something easily digestible, you might not like it or even hate it. If you are prepared to be open and let the movie "sink into you", you might like it very much. I would give the movie itself an 8. The uniqueness of the movie and how it lingers in my mind after watching it, and how it improves on each viewing makes me give it a 10.

    If a man had directed Orlando, would Orlando have been cast as a man instead of a woman? If a man had directed Orlando, would the Bronski Beat singer ended the film? Hollywood hates women. It's a man's world. Even now, Kathryn Bigelow is probably one of the few female directors. If a man had directed Orlando, shot for shot, the director of the Orlando we know today would have been hailed the next Stanley Kubrick. Rather, for twenty years, this masterpiece has lingered, without adequate recognition. Hopefully someday it will get the recognition it deserves. Unfortunately, like Derek Jarman, you will have to hunt out the film. I guess that is the curse of any great piece of art.

    This movie is about an hour and a half of staring at Tilda Swinton as she stares back at you. Saying that Orlando turned into a woman because he couldn't handle killing another human being is retarded. Women kill people too. They have been doing it as long as men have. I love the book, love it, and I am usually quite open to loose adaptation, but this is one case where the director was in love with showing the different time periods and had skewed ideas about gender. I understand that the book is odd, that it isn't the most cinematic, but maybe that's why the director/writer should have let this project alone. Having Tilda Swinton stare at the camera every five minutes did not add to any themes or ideas, nor did it enhance the plot. It was just creepy and slow moving. Also, what was with the weird singing angel at the end? I mean, what could that have possibly meant? P.S. I wanted a Fly Loo scene.

    As someone who knows nothing at all about Virginia Woolf and her writing career, I found this film rather vacuous. Sure the costumes and sets were great, I do love much of those eras clothing styles, but that hardly makes a great film. Hollywood has this thing with books and IMHO if you need to know the book prior to seeing the movie then the movie is at fault either the screenwriter or director failed to make a film that can stand on its own. Maybe it was an impossible task I don't know since I haven't read the book. Too much seems to depend upon knowing the author and her relationship with her friend but without that foreknowledge it loses any irony or bite. Tilde Swinson simply cannot make a convincing male and for 2/3 of the movie that simply got in the way.

    Orlando! The human predicament incarnated in a poetic piece of art. The movie is far from being entertaining; however, I couldn't get rid of that urge to watch it twice and thrice because it simply challenged my mind. For me, it was like reading a beautifully rhymed poem in a strange language. I had to see it more than once to understand every word, every gesture, every look. An in the process, I discover something new. Despite the strong feminist undertones, the movie generally ponders on the human existence presented by the tiresias-like symbolic figure Orlando, the androgynous lord who lives for more than four centuries discovering the true nature of death, love, poetry, politics, society, and sex. Orlando is a must-see if you want to keep your mind buzzing for days. One important lesson I learned from this movie: Tilda Swinton is an acting goddess!

    Sally Potter's Orlando is a clever and ambitious dissection of love and gender that defies culturally sexed expectations in both content and form. The film owes much of its narrative experimentalism to Virginia Woolf, who first conceived the story of immortal, androgynous Orlando as an exploration of societal prejudice and conduct, satirizing naively patriarchal feelings of romantic ownership and the laughably self- important status of masculine art. Potter deserves credit, however, for translating the story into a Brechtian subversion of traditional viewership modes: the film's drag casting, fourth wall disruption, titles and music all remind us to be conscious and critical of how we engage the film. Orlando is anchored by a charming performance from Tilda Swinton, and some stunning costume and set design. It is a smart film that challenges the sexed gaze, and it genuinely earns the sense of hope it ends on. -TK 10/12/10

    It. The humanity. In the first case I did not like his outlook and in the second, I did not like her name. Otherwise brilliant play. Playful, interesting, my first of this kind and with very good sound-track. Very good historical retrospective told in its cultural context also. Kingdom with a queen, society of men, poetry, science, adventures, future, windy job, time for conscious choice. High level of abstractness that gets down to the contemporary viewer through different big talks. With the purpose to show him what he looked like, what he is now and to be asked what he wants to be for now on. Historical load showed to us as being left aside the road. Not forgotten. One of the possible ones but came real. More social concepts in the rubric "it happened like this". Again, interesting, moving. Lovely surprise and amusement.

    I red -some praise "acting" of Tilda. THose folks doesn't know anything about acting to write that. when i come across of such "works of art"- I think of millions people and other creatures of the world who r in trouble and starving. And those people who r responsible of funding this nonsense, instead of spending money wisely and humanely. So much money goes to fund crap like that. Again n again, this "movie" is perfect example. Yuck to EVERYTHING about this piece of crap. Yucky people are who waste money this way. What about those who gave some better reviews to "this"? They r loonies and should be very ashamed of themselves.

    Tilda Swinton as a man does require a certain denial. She is female lets not deny it. She is not the epitome of femininity but that is not a detraction from the person she portrays. She is plain but from start to finish she is not asexual far from it. She is rounded in her portrayal of Orlando except in the minor aspect of the deficiency in anger that is found in many men or to be more precise the denial of their expectations and acceptance of the reality with which they are met. However, his/her characters adaptability and acceptance of reality despite the negatives of choosing a such a crippled sex in that age is what defines her inherent female persona from start to finish. Quentin Crisp knowing his personal history is the epitome of queen and Billy Zanes acceptance of Orlando for the person that he/she is shows that his nature while that of a hero does not typify a gender pre-requisite stereotype. This is a beautifully rendered film with a delicate touch and attention to detail not just of England's mini ice age but of a richer tapestry that skates just above below the ice. When watching it you are scared to intrude as everything feels so fragile however the warmth, endurance and re-creation of Orlando as a life affirming force of nature is what makes this experience so robust. If anything it says that gender is not the issue but the the will of the individual to move forward in life despite the illusions and obstacles that society presents as the norm. If I have any negative comments on the movie is that it should have been longer and filled in the gaps that were obvious in the life of anyone who is over 400 years old as it fails to emphasize the tearing and pain that such inherent change entails.

    Tilda Swinton, like always, is mesmerizing here, simply captivating. I did see the film just for her, and she doesn't disappoint (but really, when has she). The film itself also has a very moody tone, and it's pretty great in its first act. Although I don't think it's a drastic step down in the last two acts, it does finally settle on just being very good. But really, Swinton owns this. In fact, Swinton has the knack to be able to convey so much with her one still expression, one that can make us feel and understand what her characters are feeling. She's amazing here, and she's one of the best actresses alive. Let's just be grateful we have her.

Playful, interesting, my first of this kind and with very good sound-track. Very good historical retrospective told in its cultural context also. Kingdom with a queen, society of men, poetry, science, adventures, future, windy job, time for conscious choice. High level of abstractness that gets down to the contemporary viewer through different big talks. With the purpose to show him what he looked like, what he is now and to be asked what he wants to be for now on. Historical load showed to us as being left aside the road. Not forgotten. One of the possible ones but came real. More social concepts in the rubric "it happened like this". Again, interesting, moving. Lovely surprise and amusement.

    I red -some praise "acting" of Tilda. THose folks doesn't know anything about acting to write that. when i come across of such "works of art"- I think of millions people and other creatures of the world who r in trouble and starving. And those people who r responsible of funding this nonsense, instead of spending money wisely and humanely. So much money goes to fund crap like that. Again n again, this "movie" is perfect example. Yuck to EVERYTHING about this piece of crap. Yucky people are who waste money this way. What about those who gave some better reviews to "this"? They r loonies and should be very ashamed of themselves.

    Tilda Swinton as a man does require a certain denial. She is female lets not deny it. She is not the epitome of femininity but that is not a detraction from the person she portrays. She is plain but from start to finish she is not asexual far from it. She is rounded in her portrayal of Orlando except in the minor aspect of the deficiency in anger that is found in many men or to be more precise the denial of their expectations and acceptance of the reality with which they are met. However, his/her characters adaptability and acceptance of reality despite the negatives of choosing a such a crippled sex in that age is what defines her inherent female persona from start to finish. Quentin Crisp knowing his personal history is the epitome of queen and Billy Zanes acceptance of Orlando for the person that he/she is shows that his nature while that of a hero does not typify a gender pre-requisite stereotype. This is a beautifully rendered film with a delicate touch and attention to detail not just of England's mini ice age but of a richer tapestry that skates just above below the ice. When watching it you are scared to intrude as everything feels so fragile however the warmth, endurance and re-creation of Orlando as a life affirming force of nature is what makes this experience so robust. If anything it says that gender is not the issue but the the will of the individual to move forward in life despite the illusions and obstacles that society presents as the norm. If I have any negative comments on the movie is that it should have been longer and filled in the gaps that were obvious in the life of anyone who is over 400 years old as it fails to emphasize the tearing and pain that such inherent change entails.

    Tilda Swinton, like always, is mesmerizing here, simply captivating. I did see the film just for her, and she doesn't disappoint (but really, when has she). The film itself also has a very moody tone, and it's pretty great in its first act. Although I don't think it's a drastic step down in the last two acts, it does finally settle on just being very good. But really, Swinton owns this. In fact, Swinton has the knack to be able to convey so much with her one still expression, one that can make us feel and understand what her characters are feeling. She's amazing here, and she's one of the best actresses alive. Let's just be grateful we have her.

    The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Not having read the book it is based on, I couldn't understand things such as why the Orlando character kept changing from womens to mens clothes. Now I have seen it 4-5 times in total and I've got it on DVD. On repeated viewings I have managed to catch the story and I find it to have a profound depth. Orlando is at the same time the main character and not really a part of this world. He/she goes through the centuries trying to connect to people but at the same time being different and separated from them, as if caught in a glass bubble. Not until Orlando becomes a mother, he/she truly becomes a part of this world. It is not a movie for everyone. If you want a "good film", i.e. something easily digestible, you might not like it or even hate it. If you are prepared to be open and let the movie "sink into you", you might like it very much. I would give the movie itself an 8. The uniqueness of the movie and how it lingers in my mind after watching it, and how it improves on each viewing makes me give it a 10.

    If a man had directed Orlando, would Orlando have been cast as a man instead of a woman? If a man had directed Orlando, would the Bronski Beat singer ended the film? Hollywood hates women. It's a man's world. Even now, Kathryn Bigelow is probably one of the few female directors. If a man had directed Orlando, shot for shot, the director of the Orlando we know today would have been hailed the next Stanley Kubrick. Rather, for twenty years, this masterpiece has lingered, without adequate recognition. Hopefully someday it will get the recognition it deserves. Unfortunately, like Derek Jarman, you will have to hunt out the film. I guess that is the curse of any great piece of art.

    This movie is about an hour and a half of staring at Tilda Swinton as she stares back at you. Saying that Orlando turned into a woman because he couldn't handle killing another human being is retarded. Women kill people too. They have been doing it as long as men have. I love the book, love it, and I am usually quite open to loose adaptation, but this is one case where the director was in love with showing the different time periods and had skewed ideas about gender. I understand that the book is odd, that it isn't the most cinematic, but maybe that's why the director/writer should have let this project alone. Having Tilda Swinton stare at the camera every five minutes did not add to any themes or ideas, nor did it enhance the plot. It was just creepy and slow moving. Also, what was with the weird singing angel at the end? I mean, what could that have possibly meant? P.S. I wanted a Fly Loo scene.

    As someone who knows nothing at all about Virginia Woolf and her writing career, I found this film rather vacuous. Sure the costumes and sets were great, I do love much of those eras clothing styles, but that hardly makes a great film. Hollywood has this thing with books and IMHO if you need to know the book prior to seeing the movie then the movie is at fault either the screenwriter or director failed to make a film that can stand on its own. Maybe it was an impossible task I don't know since I haven't read the book. Too much seems to depend upon knowing the author and her relationship with her friend but without that foreknowledge it loses any irony or bite. Tilde Swinson simply cannot make a convincing male and for 2/3 of the movie that simply got in the way.

    Orlando! The human predicament incarnated in a poetic piece of art. The movie is far from being entertaining; however, I couldn't get rid of that urge to watch it twice and thrice because it simply challenged my mind. For me, it was like reading a beautifully rhymed poem in a strange language. I had to see it more than once to understand every word, every gesture, every look. An in the process, I discover something new. Despite the strong feminist undertones, the movie generally ponders on the human existence presented by the tiresias-like symbolic figure Orlando, the androgynous lord who lives for more than four centuries discovering the true nature of death, love, poetry, politics, society, and sex. Orlando is a must-see if you want to keep your mind buzzing for days. One important lesson I learned from this movie: Tilda Swinton is an acting goddess!

    Sally Potter's Orlando is a clever and ambitious dissection of love and gender that defies culturally sexed expectations in both content and form. The film owes much of its narrative experimentalism to Virginia Woolf, who first conceived the story of immortal, androgynous Orlando as an exploration of societal prejudice and conduct, satirizing naively patriarchal feelings of romantic ownership and the laughably self- important status of masculine art. Potter deserves credit, however, for translating the story into a Brechtian subversion of traditional viewership modes: the film's drag casting, fourth wall disruption, titles and music all remind us to be conscious and critical of how we engage the film. Orlando is anchored by a charming performance from Tilda Swinton, and some stunning costume and set design. It is a smart film that challenges the sexed gaze, and it genuinely earns the sense of hope it ends on. -TK 10/12/10
