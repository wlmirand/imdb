 <sinopse>
  The incredible story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, told by his peer and secret rival Antonio Salieri - now confined to an insane asylum.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Antonio Salieri believes that Mozart's music is divine. He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing. But he can't understand why God favored Mozart, such a vulgar creature, to be his instrument. Salieri's envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart. He is set to take revenge.

    Accessibility is the Operative Word here, in this Glorious, Off-Center Presentation on the Genius, Influential, and Beloved Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Up until the late Sixties Classical Music was often referred to as Longhair. Meaning, of course, to the Lengthy Locks of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. It was sometimes used as a Condescension, meaning out of date, Ancient, High-Brow and such. Twentieth Century Youths and most of the Proletariat were unfamiliar, or vaguely so, of the Music or the Musicians or the Compositions that languished in thick, dusty, and heavy Record Collection Book-Albums and were considered to be boring, overstuffed, and Anachronistic to Modern Sensibilities. This was the age of Jazz, Blues, Swing, Pop, Rock n' Roll, Punk, and Rap/Hip-Hop. The decision to approach Mozart with a Reverential Tweakness was an Inspiration on Director Milos Forman's part. It gave Access to the Music and the Man, and Created a new appreciation to the Moderns who generally Loathed Classic Music and Opera. The Movie took much Criticism for its Bawdy, Gonzo take on a Sacred Cow. The Film is Loads of Fun with an undercurrent of Tragedy that is Beautifully Shot, Impeccably Costumed, and Superbly Acted. But most of all it is Highly Entertaining for a Mass Audience including those with little interest in the Subject or the Subject Matter. Even those with contempt, found in this Movie a way to Appreciate the Master, His Music, and the Period. With its Outrageous Costumes, Outdated Customs and some Hip-Lip. Simply put, this is a Modernization of Madness, both in the Film's Style and those that make up the Story. A Genius of an approach on the Portrayal of a Genius.

    Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents. F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy... Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.

    Almost 10 years after Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman takes us on another travel down the abyss of the human psyche. In the center of it all: Antonio Salieri. Old and haggard, he recounts those years of his time as Hofkapellmeister to Emperor Joseph II in which his path crossed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's. He, Salieri, the methodical worker, well-respected in the upper crust, but devoid of any lightness of being. In contrast fidgety wunderkind Mozart, unaccustomed and without etiquette, oil in the water of a society with extremely limited capability of understanding his talent. The actions by and conflict between these two characters are the poignant essence of this film. Already their very first encounter is symptomatic of the rest of the movie. Salieri operates exclusively in the shadows while Mozart's and his bride-to-be's improper behavior results in his late arrival to a presentation to the Emperor. When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse. Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy. In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course.

    Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world. The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten. The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career. The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    That laugh. Amadeus is represented through the icon of that laugh. Whether he was nervous, embarrassed, or just out of his blatant immaturity, the audience gets the pleasure of that laugh from Mozart frequently during this film. Amadeus is a fictionalized telling of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but more importantly, it tells a darker side of the human condition where jealousy is amplified, the performances are rich, and the production values make for one great period piece. Amadeus has an unconventional storytelling method of an important figure in the world. Instead of following Mozart as the hero and Salieri as the villain of the story, Salieri is the protagonist. We learn Mozart's story through someone else's eyes, which makes sense if you think about it. Seeing a legend's story told through the eyes of someone else gives us a chance to see that person for how they acted, not how they internally felt. I really love the approach and am inspired by the choice. We all have felt jealous, we've all had the jarring stab in the gut when we see someone do something better than us. It's never been better expressed than here in Amadeus. It's the topic most emphasized in the picture and it's always successfully explored. We can instantly identify with Salieri; though he's driven by rage and envy, we never look to him as the bad guy. Instead we look at him as a dark part of ourselves. Jealously as intense as the situation in Amadeus could make us question everything about ourselves: our talent, our interests, our beliefs in God. The immoral resentment conveyed on screen is something remarkable, proving that jealousy has no limits to what it can do to a man. Being as organized as an uptight, old lady's desk drawer, Amadeus never feels as long as its extensive running time suggests. It moves from scene to scene, keeping the story and characters alive and interesting enough for us to care. The set of the theatre house is dauntingly beautiful and costume design fits the film like the last piece to a jigsaw puzzle making the film a stunning thing to view. Amadeus about one of the most celebrated musicians in history is obviously going to thrive in the music department, and it does, each song magnified to be an epic musical spectacle. It's the grand exploration Mozart's music labors deserve. A Tale of Two Madmen. The first man too childish for his own good. The second driven mad by jealousy. The characterization of Mozart is fantastic by Tom Hulce. Hucle embodies the musician's tantalizing spirit and has wild eccentric power behind the portrayal. The only time Saleri ever fully gets the praise over Mozart is with the actor's portrayals of the two figures. F. Murray Abraham is the true star in Amadeus, pushing the sad man through his flesh, making him pop. The two performances stay true to the souls of their characters: Saleri's jealousy grows him into an even older man than his age, while Mozart's youth feels everlasting as is his musical composition. Amadeus is artistic work in every sense of the word. It shows the gifted artist collecting the brilliance that seeps through his skull, the strain behind that gift. But it shows the even more consuming tendencies artists who aren't struggle to find live up to what they make their lives about. Amadeus is a masterful film that captures the hideous emotion of jealousy and insanity in a way that still isn't forgotten today. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A

    Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means "Loved by God" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music.

    As a student of art history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across on screen. Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation). When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas. And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri. And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway). Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity "Shakespeare in Love", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar! There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and clich&eacute;s about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see "Amadeus" instead!

    The late Roger Ebert's 2002 review of this film is spot-on. It's a movie about genius and poisonous envy. I recommend watching this movie when you can be uninterrupted and have the sound up. This movie is different....your expectations can ruin (or alternatively, surprise you) of watch you see (and hear). The music is as much a star in this movie as the actors. I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but that doesn't matter. Salieri is furious at God...how could HE possibly have this (what he considers to be a vulgar and moronic boy) produce such beautiful, transfixing music???? His envy, and his fury at God ruin the rest of his life (which is another aspect of this movie that is worth thinking about). I highly recommend this movie. Your time will have been well spent.

    I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think. Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside. I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it.

    Amadeus. A twisted story of the prodigy and genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most brilliant composer of all time who according to this film was a young rock star who somehow wrote boozed up masterpieces all day while dealing with a persistent fever. Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time. Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack. This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham. God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender. The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap. The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around. As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing... The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup. The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music. Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints. By Travis Lipshus for more reviews goto http://travislipshus.blogspot.com.au/

    Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means "Loved by God" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music.

    As a student of art history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across on screen. Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation). When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas. And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri. And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway). Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity "Shakespeare in Love", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar! There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and clich&eacute;s about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see "Amadeus" instead!

    The late Roger Ebert's 2002 review of this film is spot-on. It's a movie about genius and poisonous envy. I recommend watching this movie when you can be uninterrupted and have the sound up. This movie is different....your expectations can ruin (or alternatively, surprise you) of watch you see (and hear). The music is as much a star in this movie as the actors. I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but that doesn't matter. Salieri is furious at God...how could HE possibly have this (what he considers to be a vulgar and moronic boy) produce such beautiful, transfixing music???? His envy, and his fury at God ruin the rest of his life (which is another aspect of this movie that is worth thinking about). I highly recommend this movie. Your time will have been well spent.

    I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think. Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside. I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it.

    Amadeus. A twisted story of the prodigy and genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most brilliant composer of all time who according to this film was a young rock star who somehow wrote boozed up masterpieces all day while dealing with a persistent fever. Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time. Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack. This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham. God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender. The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap. The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around. As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing... The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup. The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music. Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints. By Travis Lipshus for more reviews goto http://travislipshus.blogspot.com.au/

    Accessibility is the Operative Word here, in this Glorious, Off-Center Presentation on the Genius, Influential, and Beloved Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Up until the late Sixties Classical Music was often referred to as Longhair. Meaning, of course, to the Lengthy Locks of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. It was sometimes used as a Condescension, meaning out of date, Ancient, High-Brow and such. Twentieth Century Youths and most of the Proletariat were unfamiliar, or vaguely so, of the Music or the Musicians or the Compositions that languished in thick, dusty, and heavy Record Collection Book-Albums and were considered to be boring, overstuffed, and Anachronistic to Modern Sensibilities. This was the age of Jazz, Blues, Swing, Pop, Rock n' Roll, Punk, and Rap/Hip-Hop. The decision to approach Mozart with a Reverential Tweakness was an Inspiration on Director Milos Forman's part. It gave Access to the Music and the Man, and Created a new appreciation to the Moderns who generally Loathed Classic Music and Opera. The Movie took much Criticism for its Bawdy, Gonzo take on a Sacred Cow. The Film is Loads of Fun with an undercurrent of Tragedy that is Beautifully Shot, Impeccably Costumed, and Superbly Acted. But most of all it is Highly Entertaining for a Mass Audience including those with little interest in the Subject or the Subject Matter. Even those with contempt, found in this Movie a way to Appreciate the Master, His Music, and the Period. With its Outrageous Costumes, Outdated Customs and some Hip-Lip. Simply put, this is a Modernization of Madness, both in the Film's Style and those that make up the Story. A Genius of an approach on the Portrayal of a Genius.

    Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents. F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy... Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.

    Almost 10 years after Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman takes us on another travel down the abyss of the human psyche. In the center of it all: Antonio Salieri. Old and haggard, he recounts those years of his time as Hofkapellmeister to Emperor Joseph II in which his path crossed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's. He, Salieri, the methodical worker, well-respected in the upper crust, but devoid of any lightness of being. In contrast fidgety wunderkind Mozart, unaccustomed and without etiquette, oil in the water of a society with extremely limited capability of understanding his talent. The actions by and conflict between these two characters are the poignant essence of this film. Already their very first encounter is symptomatic of the rest of the movie. Salieri operates exclusively in the shadows while Mozart's and his bride-to-be's improper behavior results in his late arrival to a presentation to the Emperor. When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse. Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy. In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course.

    Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world. The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten. The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career. The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    That laugh. Amadeus is represented through the icon of that laugh. Whether he was nervous, embarrassed, or just out of his blatant immaturity, the audience gets the pleasure of that laugh from Mozart frequently during this film. Amadeus is a fictionalized telling of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but more importantly, it tells a darker side of the human condition where jealousy is amplified, the performances are rich, and the production values make for one great period piece. Amadeus has an unconventional storytelling method of an important figure in the world. Instead of following Mozart as the hero and Salieri as the villain of the story, Salieri is the protagonist. We learn Mozart's story through someone else's eyes, which makes sense if you think about it. Seeing a legend's story told through the eyes of someone else gives us a chance to see that person for how they acted, not how they internally felt. I really love the approach and am inspired by the choice. We all have felt jealous, we've all had the jarring stab in the gut when we see someone do something better than us. It's never been better expressed than here in Amadeus. It's the topic most emphasized in the picture and it's always successfully explored. We can instantly identify with Salieri; though he's driven by rage and envy, we never look to him as the bad guy. Instead we look at him as a dark part of ourselves. Jealously as intense as the situation in Amadeus could make us question everything about ourselves: our talent, our interests, our beliefs in God. The immoral resentment conveyed on screen is something remarkable, proving that jealousy has no limits to what it can do to a man. Being as organized as an uptight, old lady's desk drawer, Amadeus never feels as long as its extensive running time suggests. It moves from scene to scene, keeping the story and characters alive and interesting enough for us to care. The set of the theatre house is dauntingly beautiful and costume design fits the film like the last piece to a jigsaw puzzle making the film a stunning thing to view. Amadeus about one of the most celebrated musicians in history is obviously going to thrive in the music department, and it does, each song magnified to be an epic musical spectacle. It's the grand exploration Mozart's music labors deserve. A Tale of Two Madmen. The first man too childish for his own good. The second driven mad by jealousy. The characterization of Mozart is fantastic by Tom Hulce. Hucle embodies the musician's tantalizing spirit and has wild eccentric power behind the portrayal. The only time Saleri ever fully gets the praise over Mozart is with the actor's portrayals of the two figures. F. Murray Abraham is the true star in Amadeus, pushing the sad man through his flesh, making him pop. The two performances stay true to the souls of their characters: Saleri's jealousy grows him into an even older man than his age, while Mozart's youth feels everlasting as is his musical composition. Amadeus is artistic work in every sense of the word. It shows the gifted artist collecting the brilliance that seeps through his skull, the strain behind that gift. But it shows the even more consuming tendencies artists who aren't struggle to find live up to what they make their lives about. Amadeus is a masterful film that captures the hideous emotion of jealousy and insanity in a way that still isn't forgotten today. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A

Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse. Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy. In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course.

    Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world. The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten. The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career. The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow.

    That laugh. Amadeus is represented through the icon of that laugh. Whether he was nervous, embarrassed, or just out of his blatant immaturity, the audience gets the pleasure of that laugh from Mozart frequently during this film. Amadeus is a fictionalized telling of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but more importantly, it tells a darker side of the human condition where jealousy is amplified, the performances are rich, and the production values make for one great period piece. Amadeus has an unconventional storytelling method of an important figure in the world. Instead of following Mozart as the hero and Salieri as the villain of the story, Salieri is the protagonist. We learn Mozart's story through someone else's eyes, which makes sense if you think about it. Seeing a legend's story told through the eyes of someone else gives us a chance to see that person for how they acted, not how they internally felt. I really love the approach and am inspired by the choice. We all have felt jealous, we've all had the jarring stab in the gut when we see someone do something better than us. It's never been better expressed than here in Amadeus. It's the topic most emphasized in the picture and it's always successfully explored. We can instantly identify with Salieri; though he's driven by rage and envy, we never look to him as the bad guy. Instead we look at him as a dark part of ourselves. Jealously as intense as the situation in Amadeus could make us question everything about ourselves: our talent, our interests, our beliefs in God. The immoral resentment conveyed on screen is something remarkable, proving that jealousy has no limits to what it can do to a man. Being as organized as an uptight, old lady's desk drawer, Amadeus never feels as long as its extensive running time suggests. It moves from scene to scene, keeping the story and characters alive and interesting enough for us to care. The set of the theatre house is dauntingly beautiful and costume design fits the film like the last piece to a jigsaw puzzle making the film a stunning thing to view. Amadeus about one of the most celebrated musicians in history is obviously going to thrive in the music department, and it does, each song magnified to be an epic musical spectacle. It's the grand exploration Mozart's music labors deserve. A Tale of Two Madmen. The first man too childish for his own good. The second driven mad by jealousy. The characterization of Mozart is fantastic by Tom Hulce. Hucle embodies the musician's tantalizing spirit and has wild eccentric power behind the portrayal. The only time Saleri ever fully gets the praise over Mozart is with the actor's portrayals of the two figures. F. Murray Abraham is the true star in Amadeus, pushing the sad man through his flesh, making him pop. The two performances stay true to the souls of their characters: Saleri's jealousy grows him into an even older man than his age, while Mozart's youth feels everlasting as is his musical composition. Amadeus is artistic work in every sense of the word. It shows the gifted artist collecting the brilliance that seeps through his skull, the strain behind that gift. But it shows the even more consuming tendencies artists who aren't struggle to find live up to what they make their lives about. Amadeus is a masterful film that captures the hideous emotion of jealousy and insanity in a way that still isn't forgotten today. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A

    Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means "Loved by God" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music.

    As a student of art history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across on screen. Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation). When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas. And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri. And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway). Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity "Shakespeare in Love", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar! There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and clich&eacute;s about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see "Amadeus" instead!

    The late Roger Ebert's 2002 review of this film is spot-on. It's a movie about genius and poisonous envy. I recommend watching this movie when you can be uninterrupted and have the sound up. This movie is different....your expectations can ruin (or alternatively, surprise you) of watch you see (and hear). The music is as much a star in this movie as the actors. I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but that doesn't matter. Salieri is furious at God...how could HE possibly have this (what he considers to be a vulgar and moronic boy) produce such beautiful, transfixing music???? His envy, and his fury at God ruin the rest of his life (which is another aspect of this movie that is worth thinking about). I highly recommend this movie. Your time will have been well spent.

    I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think. Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside. I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it.

    Amadeus. A twisted story of the prodigy and genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most brilliant composer of all time who according to this film was a young rock star who somehow wrote boozed up masterpieces all day while dealing with a persistent fever. Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time. Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack. This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham. God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender. The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap. The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around. As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing... The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup. The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music. Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints. By Travis Lipshus for more reviews goto http://travislipshus.blogspot.com.au/

    Accessibility is the Operative Word here, in this Glorious, Off-Center Presentation on the Genius, Influential, and Beloved Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Up until the late Sixties Classical Music was often referred to as Longhair. Meaning, of course, to the Lengthy Locks of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. It was sometimes used as a Condescension, meaning out of date, Ancient, High-Brow and such. Twentieth Century Youths and most of the Proletariat were unfamiliar, or vaguely so, of the Music or the Musicians or the Compositions that languished in thick, dusty, and heavy Record Collection Book-Albums and were considered to be boring, overstuffed, and Anachronistic to Modern Sensibilities. This was the age of Jazz, Blues, Swing, Pop, Rock n' Roll, Punk, and Rap/Hip-Hop. The decision to approach Mozart with a Reverential Tweakness was an Inspiration on Director Milos Forman's part. It gave Access to the Music and the Man, and Created a new appreciation to the Moderns who generally Loathed Classic Music and Opera. The Movie took much Criticism for its Bawdy, Gonzo take on a Sacred Cow. The Film is Loads of Fun with an undercurrent of Tragedy that is Beautifully Shot, Impeccably Costumed, and Superbly Acted. But most of all it is Highly Entertaining for a Mass Audience including those with little interest in the Subject or the Subject Matter. Even those with contempt, found in this Movie a way to Appreciate the Master, His Music, and the Period. With its Outrageous Costumes, Outdated Customs and some Hip-Lip. Simply put, this is a Modernization of Madness, both in the Film's Style and those that make up the Story. A Genius of an approach on the Portrayal of a Genius.

    Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents. F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy... Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.

    Almost 10 years after Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman takes us on another travel down the abyss of the human psyche. In the center of it all: Antonio Salieri. Old and haggard, he recounts those years of his time as Hofkapellmeister to Emperor Joseph II in which his path crossed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's. He, Salieri, the methodical worker, well-respected in the upper crust, but devoid of any lightness of being. In contrast fidgety wunderkind Mozart, unaccustomed and without etiquette, oil in the water of a society with extremely limited capability of understanding his talent. The actions by and conflict between these two characters are the poignant essence of this film. Already their very first encounter is symptomatic of the rest of the movie. Salieri operates exclusively in the shadows while Mozart's and his bride-to-be's improper behavior results in his late arrival to a presentation to the Emperor. When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse. Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy. In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course.

Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time. Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack. This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham. God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender. The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap. The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around. As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing... The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup. The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music. Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints. By Travis Lipshus for more reviews goto http://travislipshus.blogspot.com.au/

    Accessibility is the Operative Word here, in this Glorious, Off-Center Presentation on the Genius, Influential, and Beloved Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Up until the late Sixties Classical Music was often referred to as Longhair. Meaning, of course, to the Lengthy Locks of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. It was sometimes used as a Condescension, meaning out of date, Ancient, High-Brow and such. Twentieth Century Youths and most of the Proletariat were unfamiliar, or vaguely so, of the Music or the Musicians or the Compositions that languished in thick, dusty, and heavy Record Collection Book-Albums and were considered to be boring, overstuffed, and Anachronistic to Modern Sensibilities. This was the age of Jazz, Blues, Swing, Pop, Rock n' Roll, Punk, and Rap/Hip-Hop. The decision to approach Mozart with a Reverential Tweakness was an Inspiration on Director Milos Forman's part. It gave Access to the Music and the Man, and Created a new appreciation to the Moderns who generally Loathed Classic Music and Opera. The Movie took much Criticism for its Bawdy, Gonzo take on a Sacred Cow. The Film is Loads of Fun with an undercurrent of Tragedy that is Beautifully Shot, Impeccably Costumed, and Superbly Acted. But most of all it is Highly Entertaining for a Mass Audience including those with little interest in the Subject or the Subject Matter. Even those with contempt, found in this Movie a way to Appreciate the Master, His Music, and the Period. With its Outrageous Costumes, Outdated Customs and some Hip-Lip. Simply put, this is a Modernization of Madness, both in the Film's Style and those that make up the Story. A Genius of an approach on the Portrayal of a Genius.

    Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents. F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy... Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.

    Almost 10 years after Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman takes us on another travel down the abyss of the human psyche. In the center of it all: Antonio Salieri. Old and haggard, he recounts those years of his time as Hofkapellmeister to Emperor Joseph II in which his path crossed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's. He, Salieri, the methodical worker, well-respected in the upper crust, but devoid of any lightness of being. In contrast fidgety wunderkind Mozart, unaccustomed and without etiquette, oil in the water of a society with extremely limited capability of understanding his talent. The actions by and conflict between these two characters are the poignant essence of this film. Already their very first encounter is symptomatic of the rest of the movie. Salieri operates exclusively in the shadows while Mozart's and his bride-to-be's improper behavior results in his late arrival to a presentation to the Emperor. When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse. Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy. In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course.

    Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world. The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten. The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career. The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    That laugh. Amadeus is represented through the icon of that laugh. Whether he was nervous, embarrassed, or just out of his blatant immaturity, the audience gets the pleasure of that laugh from Mozart frequently during this film. Amadeus is a fictionalized telling of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but more importantly, it tells a darker side of the human condition where jealousy is amplified, the performances are rich, and the production values make for one great period piece. Amadeus has an unconventional storytelling method of an important figure in the world. Instead of following Mozart as the hero and Salieri as the villain of the story, Salieri is the protagonist. We learn Mozart's story through someone else's eyes, which makes sense if you think about it. Seeing a legend's story told through the eyes of someone else gives us a chance to see that person for how they acted, not how they internally felt. I really love the approach and am inspired by the choice. We all have felt jealous, we've all had the jarring stab in the gut when we see someone do something better than us. It's never been better expressed than here in Amadeus. It's the topic most emphasized in the picture and it's always successfully explored. We can instantly identify with Salieri; though he's driven by rage and envy, we never look to him as the bad guy. Instead we look at him as a dark part of ourselves. Jealously as intense as the situation in Amadeus could make us question everything about ourselves: our talent, our interests, our beliefs in God. The immoral resentment conveyed on screen is something remarkable, proving that jealousy has no limits to what it can do to a man. Being as organized as an uptight, old lady's desk drawer, Amadeus never feels as long as its extensive running time suggests. It moves from scene to scene, keeping the story and characters alive and interesting enough for us to care. The set of the theatre house is dauntingly beautiful and costume design fits the film like the last piece to a jigsaw puzzle making the film a stunning thing to view. Amadeus about one of the most celebrated musicians in history is obviously going to thrive in the music department, and it does, each song magnified to be an epic musical spectacle. It's the grand exploration Mozart's music labors deserve. A Tale of Two Madmen. The first man too childish for his own good. The second driven mad by jealousy. The characterization of Mozart is fantastic by Tom Hulce. Hucle embodies the musician's tantalizing spirit and has wild eccentric power behind the portrayal. The only time Saleri ever fully gets the praise over Mozart is with the actor's portrayals of the two figures. F. Murray Abraham is the true star in Amadeus, pushing the sad man through his flesh, making him pop. The two performances stay true to the souls of their characters: Saleri's jealousy grows him into an even older man than his age, while Mozart's youth feels everlasting as is his musical composition. Amadeus is artistic work in every sense of the word. It shows the gifted artist collecting the brilliance that seeps through his skull, the strain behind that gift. But it shows the even more consuming tendencies artists who aren't struggle to find live up to what they make their lives about. Amadeus is a masterful film that captures the hideous emotion of jealousy and insanity in a way that still isn't forgotten today. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A

    Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means "Loved by God" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music.

    As a student of art history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across on screen. Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation). When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas. And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri. And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway). Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity "Shakespeare in Love", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar! There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and clich&eacute;s about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see "Amadeus" instead!

    The late Roger Ebert's 2002 review of this film is spot-on. It's a movie about genius and poisonous envy. I recommend watching this movie when you can be uninterrupted and have the sound up. This movie is different....your expectations can ruin (or alternatively, surprise you) of watch you see (and hear). The music is as much a star in this movie as the actors. I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but that doesn't matter. Salieri is furious at God...how could HE possibly have this (what he considers to be a vulgar and moronic boy) produce such beautiful, transfixing music???? His envy, and his fury at God ruin the rest of his life (which is another aspect of this movie that is worth thinking about). I highly recommend this movie. Your time will have been well spent.

    I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think. Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside. I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it.

    Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means "Loved by God" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music.

    As a student of art history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across on screen. Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation). When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas. And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri. And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway). Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity "Shakespeare in Love", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar! There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and clich&eacute;s about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see "Amadeus" instead!

    The late Roger Ebert's 2002 review of this film is spot-on. It's a movie about genius and poisonous envy. I recommend watching this movie when you can be uninterrupted and have the sound up. This movie is different....your expectations can ruin (or alternatively, surprise you) of watch you see (and hear). The music is as much a star in this movie as the actors. I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but that doesn't matter. Salieri is furious at God...how could HE possibly have this (what he considers to be a vulgar and moronic boy) produce such beautiful, transfixing music???? His envy, and his fury at God ruin the rest of his life (which is another aspect of this movie that is worth thinking about). I highly recommend this movie. Your time will have been well spent.

    I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think. Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside. I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it.

    Amadeus. A twisted story of the prodigy and genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most brilliant composer of all time who according to this film was a young rock star who somehow wrote boozed up masterpieces all day while dealing with a persistent fever. Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time. Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack. This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham. God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender. The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap. The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around. As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing... The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup. The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music. Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints. By Travis Lipshus for more reviews goto http://travislipshus.blogspot.com.au/

    Accessibility is the Operative Word here, in this Glorious, Off-Center Presentation on the Genius, Influential, and Beloved Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Up until the late Sixties Classical Music was often referred to as Longhair. Meaning, of course, to the Lengthy Locks of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. It was sometimes used as a Condescension, meaning out of date, Ancient, High-Brow and such. Twentieth Century Youths and most of the Proletariat were unfamiliar, or vaguely so, of the Music or the Musicians or the Compositions that languished in thick, dusty, and heavy Record Collection Book-Albums and were considered to be boring, overstuffed, and Anachronistic to Modern Sensibilities. This was the age of Jazz, Blues, Swing, Pop, Rock n' Roll, Punk, and Rap/Hip-Hop. The decision to approach Mozart with a Reverential Tweakness was an Inspiration on Director Milos Forman's part. It gave Access to the Music and the Man, and Created a new appreciation to the Moderns who generally Loathed Classic Music and Opera. The Movie took much Criticism for its Bawdy, Gonzo take on a Sacred Cow. The Film is Loads of Fun with an undercurrent of Tragedy that is Beautifully Shot, Impeccably Costumed, and Superbly Acted. But most of all it is Highly Entertaining for a Mass Audience including those with little interest in the Subject or the Subject Matter. Even those with contempt, found in this Movie a way to Appreciate the Master, His Music, and the Period. With its Outrageous Costumes, Outdated Customs and some Hip-Lip. Simply put, this is a Modernization of Madness, both in the Film's Style and those that make up the Story. A Genius of an approach on the Portrayal of a Genius.

    Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents. F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy... Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.

    Almost 10 years after Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman takes us on another travel down the abyss of the human psyche. In the center of it all: Antonio Salieri. Old and haggard, he recounts those years of his time as Hofkapellmeister to Emperor Joseph II in which his path crossed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's. He, Salieri, the methodical worker, well-respected in the upper crust, but devoid of any lightness of being. In contrast fidgety wunderkind Mozart, unaccustomed and without etiquette, oil in the water of a society with extremely limited capability of understanding his talent. The actions by and conflict between these two characters are the poignant essence of this film. Already their very first encounter is symptomatic of the rest of the movie. Salieri operates exclusively in the shadows while Mozart's and his bride-to-be's improper behavior results in his late arrival to a presentation to the Emperor. When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse. Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy. In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course.

    Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world. The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten. The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career. The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    That laugh. Amadeus is represented through the icon of that laugh. Whether he was nervous, embarrassed, or just out of his blatant immaturity, the audience gets the pleasure of that laugh from Mozart frequently during this film. Amadeus is a fictionalized telling of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but more importantly, it tells a darker side of the human condition where jealousy is amplified, the performances are rich, and the production values make for one great period piece. Amadeus has an unconventional storytelling method of an important figure in the world. Instead of following Mozart as the hero and Salieri as the villain of the story, Salieri is the protagonist. We learn Mozart's story through someone else's eyes, which makes sense if you think about it. Seeing a legend's story told through the eyes of someone else gives us a chance to see that person for how they acted, not how they internally felt. I really love the approach and am inspired by the choice. We all have felt jealous, we've all had the jarring stab in the gut when we see someone do something better than us. It's never been better expressed than here in Amadeus. It's the topic most emphasized in the picture and it's always successfully explored. We can instantly identify with Salieri; though he's driven by rage and envy, we never look to him as the bad guy. Instead we look at him as a dark part of ourselves. Jealously as intense as the situation in Amadeus could make us question everything about ourselves: our talent, our interests, our beliefs in God. The immoral resentment conveyed on screen is something remarkable, proving that jealousy has no limits to what it can do to a man. Being as organized as an uptight, old lady's desk drawer, Amadeus never feels as long as its extensive running time suggests. It moves from scene to scene, keeping the story and characters alive and interesting enough for us to care. The set of the theatre house is dauntingly beautiful and costume design fits the film like the last piece to a jigsaw puzzle making the film a stunning thing to view. Amadeus about one of the most celebrated musicians in history is obviously going to thrive in the music department, and it does, each song magnified to be an epic musical spectacle. It's the grand exploration Mozart's music labors deserve. A Tale of Two Madmen. The first man too childish for his own good. The second driven mad by jealousy. The characterization of Mozart is fantastic by Tom Hulce. Hucle embodies the musician's tantalizing spirit and has wild eccentric power behind the portrayal. The only time Saleri ever fully gets the praise over Mozart is with the actor's portrayals of the two figures. F. Murray Abraham is the true star in Amadeus, pushing the sad man through his flesh, making him pop. The two performances stay true to the souls of their characters: Saleri's jealousy grows him into an even older man than his age, while Mozart's youth feels everlasting as is his musical composition. Amadeus is artistic work in every sense of the word. It shows the gifted artist collecting the brilliance that seeps through his skull, the strain behind that gift. But it shows the even more consuming tendencies artists who aren't struggle to find live up to what they make their lives about. Amadeus is a masterful film that captures the hideous emotion of jealousy and insanity in a way that still isn't forgotten today. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A

His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse. Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy. In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course.

    Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world. The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten. The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career. The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow.

    That laugh. Amadeus is represented through the icon of that laugh. Whether he was nervous, embarrassed, or just out of his blatant immaturity, the audience gets the pleasure of that laugh from Mozart frequently during this film. Amadeus is a fictionalized telling of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but more importantly, it tells a darker side of the human condition where jealousy is amplified, the performances are rich, and the production values make for one great period piece. Amadeus has an unconventional storytelling method of an important figure in the world. Instead of following Mozart as the hero and Salieri as the villain of the story, Salieri is the protagonist. We learn Mozart's story through someone else's eyes, which makes sense if you think about it. Seeing a legend's story told through the eyes of someone else gives us a chance to see that person for how they acted, not how they internally felt. I really love the approach and am inspired by the choice. We all have felt jealous, we've all had the jarring stab in the gut when we see someone do something better than us. It's never been better expressed than here in Amadeus. It's the topic most emphasized in the picture and it's always successfully explored. We can instantly identify with Salieri; though he's driven by rage and envy, we never look to him as the bad guy. Instead we look at him as a dark part of ourselves. Jealously as intense as the situation in Amadeus could make us question everything about ourselves: our talent, our interests, our beliefs in God. The immoral resentment conveyed on screen is something remarkable, proving that jealousy has no limits to what it can do to a man. Being as organized as an uptight, old lady's desk drawer, Amadeus never feels as long as its extensive running time suggests. It moves from scene to scene, keeping the story and characters alive and interesting enough for us to care. The set of the theatre house is dauntingly beautiful and costume design fits the film like the last piece to a jigsaw puzzle making the film a stunning thing to view. Amadeus about one of the most celebrated musicians in history is obviously going to thrive in the music department, and it does, each song magnified to be an epic musical spectacle. It's the grand exploration Mozart's music labors deserve. A Tale of Two Madmen. The first man too childish for his own good. The second driven mad by jealousy. The characterization of Mozart is fantastic by Tom Hulce. Hucle embodies the musician's tantalizing spirit and has wild eccentric power behind the portrayal. The only time Saleri ever fully gets the praise over Mozart is with the actor's portrayals of the two figures. F. Murray Abraham is the true star in Amadeus, pushing the sad man through his flesh, making him pop. The two performances stay true to the souls of their characters: Saleri's jealousy grows him into an even older man than his age, while Mozart's youth feels everlasting as is his musical composition. Amadeus is artistic work in every sense of the word. It shows the gifted artist collecting the brilliance that seeps through his skull, the strain behind that gift. But it shows the even more consuming tendencies artists who aren't struggle to find live up to what they make their lives about. Amadeus is a masterful film that captures the hideous emotion of jealousy and insanity in a way that still isn't forgotten today. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A

    Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means "Loved by God" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music.

    As a student of art history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across on screen. Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation). When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas. And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri. And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway). Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity "Shakespeare in Love", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar! There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and clich&eacute;s about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see "Amadeus" instead!

    The late Roger Ebert's 2002 review of this film is spot-on. It's a movie about genius and poisonous envy. I recommend watching this movie when you can be uninterrupted and have the sound up. This movie is different....your expectations can ruin (or alternatively, surprise you) of watch you see (and hear). The music is as much a star in this movie as the actors. I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but that doesn't matter. Salieri is furious at God...how could HE possibly have this (what he considers to be a vulgar and moronic boy) produce such beautiful, transfixing music???? His envy, and his fury at God ruin the rest of his life (which is another aspect of this movie that is worth thinking about). I highly recommend this movie. Your time will have been well spent.

    I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think. Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside. I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it.

    Amadeus. A twisted story of the prodigy and genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most brilliant composer of all time who according to this film was a young rock star who somehow wrote boozed up masterpieces all day while dealing with a persistent fever. Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time. Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack. This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham. God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender. The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap. The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around. As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing... The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup. The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music. Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints. By Travis Lipshus for more reviews goto http://travislipshus.blogspot.com.au/

    Accessibility is the Operative Word here, in this Glorious, Off-Center Presentation on the Genius, Influential, and Beloved Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Up until the late Sixties Classical Music was often referred to as Longhair. Meaning, of course, to the Lengthy Locks of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. It was sometimes used as a Condescension, meaning out of date, Ancient, High-Brow and such. Twentieth Century Youths and most of the Proletariat were unfamiliar, or vaguely so, of the Music or the Musicians or the Compositions that languished in thick, dusty, and heavy Record Collection Book-Albums and were considered to be boring, overstuffed, and Anachronistic to Modern Sensibilities. This was the age of Jazz, Blues, Swing, Pop, Rock n' Roll, Punk, and Rap/Hip-Hop. The decision to approach Mozart with a Reverential Tweakness was an Inspiration on Director Milos Forman's part. It gave Access to the Music and the Man, and Created a new appreciation to the Moderns who generally Loathed Classic Music and Opera. The Movie took much Criticism for its Bawdy, Gonzo take on a Sacred Cow. The Film is Loads of Fun with an undercurrent of Tragedy that is Beautifully Shot, Impeccably Costumed, and Superbly Acted. But most of all it is Highly Entertaining for a Mass Audience including those with little interest in the Subject or the Subject Matter. Even those with contempt, found in this Movie a way to Appreciate the Master, His Music, and the Period. With its Outrageous Costumes, Outdated Customs and some Hip-Lip. Simply put, this is a Modernization of Madness, both in the Film's Style and those that make up the Story. A Genius of an approach on the Portrayal of a Genius.

    Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents. F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy... Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.

    Almost 10 years after Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman takes us on another travel down the abyss of the human psyche. In the center of it all: Antonio Salieri. Old and haggard, he recounts those years of his time as Hofkapellmeister to Emperor Joseph II in which his path crossed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's. He, Salieri, the methodical worker, well-respected in the upper crust, but devoid of any lightness of being. In contrast fidgety wunderkind Mozart, unaccustomed and without etiquette, oil in the water of a society with extremely limited capability of understanding his talent. The actions by and conflict between these two characters are the poignant essence of this film. Already their very first encounter is symptomatic of the rest of the movie. Salieri operates exclusively in the shadows while Mozart's and his bride-to-be's improper behavior results in his late arrival to a presentation to the Emperor. When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse. Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy. In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course.

Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time. Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack. This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham. God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender. The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap. The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around. As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing... The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup. The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music. Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints. By Travis Lipshus for more reviews goto http://travislipshus.blogspot.com.au/
