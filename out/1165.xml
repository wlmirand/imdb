    If I wanted to want grown men fight like school children, society would deem that there is something wrong with me. And yet, somehow this movie was made. I have nothing against the two lead actors, but they suck something awful in this suckfest of a film. Terrible plot, terrible dialogue, and just an all-around depressing atmosphere. I can't delve into too many details lest I spoil this "film" but at one point David orders a beer at a bar and there's a record scratch, and everybody shuts up and looks at him. One guy even hits a pool ball off the table. That's pretty much how I feel about the movie. The pool ball is the point, and the movie is the pocket. This movie is about as table scratched as one could be.

    It had been a long time since I watched this movie, and I finally got to refresh my memory. I loved this movie ever since I was a kid, and it's still funny. Moranis and Arnold were perfect together. When David Leary was a kid, he was constantly bullied by Ross Bigger (Fang) When David and his family moves away, he tells the police that Ross stole a moon rock. Years later, David and his son return to town and David becomes the new creative writing teacher. He finds out that Ross is also a teacher at the same school and continues to bully him again. David soon realizes that he must stop running and face his demon once and for all. I highly recommend BIG BULLY!!!

    Before we start, I've been a victim of bullying for a year and a half before I dropped out of high school. I was 3 months away from graduating. I have constantly complained to teachers and they did nothing. The movie sends a bad message to people. This movie glorifies bullying. They try to make it out to be funny. This movie isn't a comedy in my opinion. To me, it's a horror movie. The movie starts out with David Leary as a kid being bullied by Rosco Bigger a.k.a. Fang. That's right, his last name is Bigger. Who couldn't come up with a worse name than that? The name "Fang" is derived from the fact that Rosco only has one fang instead of the usual two. One day at school, David Leary catches Rosco stealing a moon rock. He reports him the the authorities and he gets sent to Reformatory School. Then David comes home and finds out that his parent's are moving to Oakland. This makes him really happy cause he won't have to be near Rosco ever again. Then, we flash forward to David Leary being an adult. He has written a book but nobody wants to buy it except some hippie that comes in that he BS's into lying on what the story is really about. After he gets home, he gets a call. The old school that he went to wants him to teach there. That's right, out of all the schools, he has to go back to his hometown where he was bullied constantly by Rosco. When he gets to the school, by coincidence, Rosco works there as a wood shop teacher. Rosco doesn't recognize David until halfway through the film when his son mentions David's last name to him. Toward the end of the film, Rosco loses his mind and attempts to try to kill David for everything that has happened to him in reformatory school. He fails and when you get to the end, you think the bullying is over and done with, it's not. When you see David moving to New York, guess who's behind them with their mobile home? That's right, Rosco. One thing that I should mention is that David was bullied by Rosco and they both have kids. What doesn't make sense is that David's kid is bullying Rosco's kid. Why? I have no clue. But, when David Leary sees his son bullying another kid, he does nothing about it. Another thing worth mentioning is that when David Leary goes to the principal, he does nothing. That message is the only thing that is true. The school authorities won't do *bleep*! Believe me, I know. When David Leary apologizes to Rosco and tells him that what he did was wrong, I just shook my head in disbelief. What he did was the right thing. The message this movie sends is that if you are bullied, you have two options: A. Fight B. Run Why don't people actually do anything to combat bullying and prevent stuff like this from happening? They probably think it's not their problem and they shouldn't get involved. It is their problem! They should do SOMETHING about it. This movie wasn't funny in the slightest. It was just a terrible movie that just glorifies and laughs at a problem that is getting worse in America. I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Get something else.

    Every so often Hollywood takes a serious theme like murder or bullying and tries to make light of it. When that attempt gropes toward the inner pain of dark comedy, the film may have merit. Yet when the focus is on cheap non laughs surrounded by a total disregard for substance, logic, and human decency, the result is most often a bloated, turgid mess like BIG BULLY. Director Steven Miner wastes the limited talents of all concerned. Rick Moranis is a weedy, nerdy little man who has to relive the trauma of childhood bullying by beefy Tom Arnold. As the film opens, both Moranis and Arnold are in the fourth grade. Arnold plays a blubbery bully that one sometimes sees in a filmed version of a Steven King horror movie. But in the hands of a King based script, the bully is a source of unredeemed evil. Here, under Miner's unsure grasp, Arnold is no more than a walking tub of prepubescent lard who seeks to bully the nerdy Moranis. Now if Miner had tried to make a serious movie about childhood bullying, then BIG BULLY might have had something worthwhile to say about the angst of childhood insecurities. Now flash forward twenty years. Moranis and Arnold are both teachers in the same grammar school, and Arnold quickly reverts to the bully that he was. What makes this regression reprehensible is Arnold's justification that as a victim, Moranis thoroughly deserved his fate. What then follows is a ridiculous chase scene between prey and predator that offers no lasting insight into either demented personality. Julianne Phillips is a wasted toss in as Moranis' girlfriend. At the end, when director Miner seeks closure, the film ends in the uneasiest of endings, one that satisfied neither the desire for revenge nor one that offers justification for that revenge in the first place.

    I would compare this movie with such classics as Gone With The Wind. It puts a true story like Schindlers List to shame. I laughed, and I cried. I also urinated about a tablespoon from laughing. If I were to make a sequel to this classic, I would title it "Big Bully 2: Secret of the Oze." This movie has inspired me to go out and purchase an Evil Kanevil action figure. What really surprises me is the movie is based on a true story. It touched my heart like "Passion of the Christ." If Jesus was resurrected they would crucify him in this movie. Words cannot describe the natural Euphoria this movie makes me feel when I sit down to view it. Can a story get any better? Can humankind continue to create such beautiful things? Movies like this channel the human spirit onto the big screen. This movie should be dubbed as a national treasure so future generations can view the bountyful story of a tale of 2 men, who are at odds with one another, until they learn that they were meant for each other.

    There is no his picture under his name,and the scores for this movie is far too low.I really liked this movie. The music effect is specially great.What happened to you!Do I have to write 10 lines? I don't have much to say however.Well it's about a man who had been bullied by one of his old classmates. After he came back to his hometown, he found he is still scared by this old classmate "Fang". I myself was bullied by a shameless boy when I was in primary school.I still hate him even now.If I'll meet him again, I'll hit him with a hammer from back.Of course I don't think I will meet him again. And both the man and "fang" had a son. Interestingly his boy was still a "captive" of the fang. The fighting scene is wonderful.

    BIG BULLY, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy that you will never get tired of. When David (Rick Moranis) met Fang (Tom Arnold) again for the first time in several years, I got a little scared myself. This is because of what had happened between them years before. If you ask me, the performances were good, the direction was excellent, and the cast was perfectly chosen. However, what Fang did to David, even as an adult, was very childish especially since he managed to ruin David's date with Victoria (Julianne Phillips). Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy that you will never get tired of to any Rick Moranis or Tom Arnold fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a feel good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

    This movie starts out with David Leary(Rock Moranis) narrating about his youth. He has problems. This huge bully named Rosco AKA Fang bullies him around. He never has a time to eat his lunch nevertheless take a trip to the bathroom. So what does David do? He stakes Rosco out. We shoot past 20 years to Davids older days. He now has a son, Ben Leary(Blake Bashoff), and he now works as a teacher. He finally returns to the town that he had lived in as he was a kid. And who does he meet? The old bully Fang. Fang now has a huge family of his own. His youngest son has problems hanging in with the crowds. So what happens when you have the bullies preys son and the bullies predator son in the same school with both fathers working under the same roof? You have a lot of troubles. Including problems with old friends turned elder. Along with Honey I shrunk The Kids, Honey I Blew Up The Kid and Honey I Shrunk Ourselves this should be a number four classic on your favorite list and shelf. This is a good movie to show your own bullishious son and or daughter.

    So, okay ElizabethBennett, it isn't the greatest movie in the world. Calling childhood bullies rapists is going a little too far to the extreme don't ya think? Actually, your argument is completely void and holds no truth so I won't even comment any further. Silly and playful it was. Assuming you aren't a tight-butt who takes everything too dang seriously. IT'S A MOVIE MADE TO MAKE YOU LAUGH, PEOPLE, NOTHING ELSE. I doubt Tom Arnold is a rapist or is representing one either. That is insane. Talk about psychopaths. No, I am not an ex bully. I actually never got the privilege of meeting one either. But I am sure, that some (maybe some) aren't ex-cons and may have a home and family that they take well care of. Seeing as how someone below, "Doesn't take this lightly.', maybe you should jut lighten up a bit and laugh. Have some unharbored resentments towards a classmate, then it's probably not the movie for you. Otherwise, watch it and laugh. It made me laugh. Along with my husband and nephews and nieces. My grandmother even liked it. (She must be a psychopath for liking the bully movie.) LOL! Have fun!

    Rick Moranis has always been a very funny guy. He was the meek nerd doing his best young Woody Allen impersonation in "Little Shop of Horrors" (1986), and he was absolutely perfect as Barney in "My Blue Heaven," which was--at the time--his fourth pairing with Steve Martin. (They ended up making four films together.) Tom Arnold has never been particularly funny. He showed some signs of talent in "True Lies" (1994), but everything after that just went downhill. Here's a guy who has appeared in some of the worst films and television shows of the last decade, including "McHale's Navy" (1997) and "The Stupids." In fact, I went to the theater to see "McHale's Navy" upon its release and felt like vomiting from the first five minutes into it. "Big Bully" is Rick Moranis' worst film and one of Tom Arnold's best, if that's saying anything. I'll admit that the beginning of "Big Bully" was quite funny. There are many laugh-out-loud segments. But, unfortunately, they are drowned out by an over-the-top and truly awful, ridiculous ending, in which a man's old bully from school goes after him again with weapons from a wood-carving class. (Be careful, your kids may never want to go back to school again.) Rick Moranis is the man who is attacked. His name is David, and the film opens with a younger version of himself being chased down a street and up against a metal gate by a chubby fellow his own age. We assume that he is beaten to a pulp, but before we see anything, it all fades away. Years later, David has a son of his own, and has since moved out into the big city. But he's tired of the city life, and after his wife leaves him, David decides to move back to his home town, along with his son. They arrive, he finds out he has hundreds of dollars due on a Dr. Seuss book he got out from the library years ago (funny segment there), and he moves into his new home. David soon teaches school, where he finds out that an old bully of his, "Fang" (Tom Arnold), is teaching carving. David gets scared, runs away from Big Bully (who seems to be nice now, and truly wants a friendship with the man) throughout the film, until, in a scary moment, he realizes "Fang" really is still a psycho, and the two men battle it out in the school, in ridiculous, childish gags and moments. Alas, that's all the film is comprised of, with scattered--and very predictable--ideas involving romantic interests and such cliches. It's too bad--this was a decent premise to begin with. "Big Bully" literally massacred Rick Moranis' career, and since then he has appeared in only a few "real" films--unless you count straight-to-video animated and live-action Disney-esque films real movies. This is just hideous, a film to rival the bad qualities of "McHale's Navy" and "The Stupids." The movie is tolerable in an annoying sort of way until the climactic finale, which is so out of control and awful that it really just makes you want to throw up. This is one bad movie. I can't imagine a worse result stemming from such a poor comedian mixed with such a great one. Rick Moranis should sue, and Tom Arnold should die. But that's just my opinion. I'm not going to be a bully about it, or anything. 0.5/5 stars. - John Ulmer

    So, okay ElizabethBennett, it isn't the greatest movie in the world. Calling childhood bullies rapists is going a little too far to the extreme don't ya think? Actually, your argument is completely void and holds no truth so I won't even comment any further. Silly and playful it was. Assuming you aren't a tight-butt who takes everything too dang seriously. IT'S A MOVIE MADE TO MAKE YOU LAUGH, PEOPLE, NOTHING ELSE. I doubt Tom Arnold is a rapist or is representing one either. That is insane. Talk about psychopaths. No, I am not an ex bully. I actually never got the privilege of meeting one either. But I am sure, that some (maybe some) aren't ex-cons and may have a home and family that they take well care of. Seeing as how someone below, "Doesn't take this lightly.', maybe you should jut lighten up a bit and laugh. Have some unharbored resentments towards a classmate, then it's probably not the movie for you. Otherwise, watch it and laugh. It made me laugh. Along with my husband and nephews and nieces. My grandmother even liked it. (She must be a psychopath for liking the bully movie.) LOL! Have fun!

    Rick Moranis has always been a very funny guy. He was the meek nerd doing his best young Woody Allen impersonation in "Little Shop of Horrors" (1986), and he was absolutely perfect as Barney in "My Blue Heaven," which was--at the time--his fourth pairing with Steve Martin. (They ended up making four films together.) Tom Arnold has never been particularly funny. He showed some signs of talent in "True Lies" (1994), but everything after that just went downhill. Here's a guy who has appeared in some of the worst films and television shows of the last decade, including "McHale's Navy" (1997) and "The Stupids." In fact, I went to the theater to see "McHale's Navy" upon its release and felt like vomiting from the first five minutes into it. "Big Bully" is Rick Moranis' worst film and one of Tom Arnold's best, if that's saying anything. I'll admit that the beginning of "Big Bully" was quite funny. There are many laugh-out-loud segments. But, unfortunately, they are drowned out by an over-the-top and truly awful, ridiculous ending, in which a man's old bully from school goes after him again with weapons from a wood-carving class. (Be careful, your kids may never want to go back to school again.) Rick Moranis is the man who is attacked. His name is David, and the film opens with a younger version of himself being chased down a street and up against a metal gate by a chubby fellow his own age. We assume that he is beaten to a pulp, but before we see anything, it all fades away. Years later, David has a son of his own, and has since moved out into the big city. But he's tired of the city life, and after his wife leaves him, David decides to move back to his home town, along with his son. They arrive, he finds out he has hundreds of dollars due on a Dr. Seuss book he got out from the library years ago (funny segment there), and he moves into his new home. David soon teaches school, where he finds out that an old bully of his, "Fang" (Tom Arnold), is teaching carving. David gets scared, runs away from Big Bully (who seems to be nice now, and truly wants a friendship with the man) throughout the film, until, in a scary moment, he realizes "Fang" really is still a psycho, and the two men battle it out in the school, in ridiculous, childish gags and moments. Alas, that's all the film is comprised of, with scattered--and very predictable--ideas involving romantic interests and such cliches. It's too bad--this was a decent premise to begin with. "Big Bully" literally massacred Rick Moranis' career, and since then he has appeared in only a few "real" films--unless you count straight-to-video animated and live-action Disney-esque films real movies. This is just hideous, a film to rival the bad qualities of "McHale's Navy" and "The Stupids." The movie is tolerable in an annoying sort of way until the climactic finale, which is so out of control and awful that it really just makes you want to throw up. This is one bad movie. I can't imagine a worse result stemming from such a poor comedian mixed with such a great one. Rick Moranis should sue, and Tom Arnold should die. But that's just my opinion. I'm not going to be a bully about it, or anything. 0.5/5 stars. - John Ulmer

    If I wanted to want grown men fight like school children, society would deem that there is something wrong with me. And yet, somehow this movie was made. I have nothing against the two lead actors, but they suck something awful in this suckfest of a film. Terrible plot, terrible dialogue, and just an all-around depressing atmosphere. I can't delve into too many details lest I spoil this "film" but at one point David orders a beer at a bar and there's a record scratch, and everybody shuts up and looks at him. One guy even hits a pool ball off the table. That's pretty much how I feel about the movie. The pool ball is the point, and the movie is the pocket. This movie is about as table scratched as one could be.

    It had been a long time since I watched this movie, and I finally got to refresh my memory. I loved this movie ever since I was a kid, and it's still funny. Moranis and Arnold were perfect together. When David Leary was a kid, he was constantly bullied by Ross Bigger (Fang) When David and his family moves away, he tells the police that Ross stole a moon rock. Years later, David and his son return to town and David becomes the new creative writing teacher. He finds out that Ross is also a teacher at the same school and continues to bully him again. David soon realizes that he must stop running and face his demon once and for all. I highly recommend BIG BULLY!!!

    Before we start, I've been a victim of bullying for a year and a half before I dropped out of high school. I was 3 months away from graduating. I have constantly complained to teachers and they did nothing. The movie sends a bad message to people. This movie glorifies bullying. They try to make it out to be funny. This movie isn't a comedy in my opinion. To me, it's a horror movie. The movie starts out with David Leary as a kid being bullied by Rosco Bigger a.k.a. Fang. That's right, his last name is Bigger. Who couldn't come up with a worse name than that? The name "Fang" is derived from the fact that Rosco only has one fang instead of the usual two. One day at school, David Leary catches Rosco stealing a moon rock. He reports him the the authorities and he gets sent to Reformatory School. Then David comes home and finds out that his parent's are moving to Oakland. This makes him really happy cause he won't have to be near Rosco ever again. Then, we flash forward to David Leary being an adult. He has written a book but nobody wants to buy it except some hippie that comes in that he BS's into lying on what the story is really about. After he gets home, he gets a call. The old school that he went to wants him to teach there. That's right, out of all the schools, he has to go back to his hometown where he was bullied constantly by Rosco. When he gets to the school, by coincidence, Rosco works there as a wood shop teacher. Rosco doesn't recognize David until halfway through the film when his son mentions David's last name to him. Toward the end of the film, Rosco loses his mind and attempts to try to kill David for everything that has happened to him in reformatory school. He fails and when you get to the end, you think the bullying is over and done with, it's not. When you see David moving to New York, guess who's behind them with their mobile home? That's right, Rosco. One thing that I should mention is that David was bullied by Rosco and they both have kids. What doesn't make sense is that David's kid is bullying Rosco's kid. Why? I have no clue. But, when David Leary sees his son bullying another kid, he does nothing about it. Another thing worth mentioning is that when David Leary goes to the principal, he does nothing. That message is the only thing that is true. The school authorities won't do *bleep*! Believe me, I know. When David Leary apologizes to Rosco and tells him that what he did was wrong, I just shook my head in disbelief. What he did was the right thing. The message this movie sends is that if you are bullied, you have two options: A. Fight B. Run Why don't people actually do anything to combat bullying and prevent stuff like this from happening? They probably think it's not their problem and they shouldn't get involved. It is their problem! They should do SOMETHING about it. This movie wasn't funny in the slightest. It was just a terrible movie that just glorifies and laughs at a problem that is getting worse in America. I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Get something else.

    Every so often Hollywood takes a serious theme like murder or bullying and tries to make light of it. When that attempt gropes toward the inner pain of dark comedy, the film may have merit. Yet when the focus is on cheap non laughs surrounded by a total disregard for substance, logic, and human decency, the result is most often a bloated, turgid mess like BIG BULLY. Director Steven Miner wastes the limited talents of all concerned. Rick Moranis is a weedy, nerdy little man who has to relive the trauma of childhood bullying by beefy Tom Arnold. As the film opens, both Moranis and Arnold are in the fourth grade. Arnold plays a blubbery bully that one sometimes sees in a filmed version of a Steven King horror movie. But in the hands of a King based script, the bully is a source of unredeemed evil. Here, under Miner's unsure grasp, Arnold is no more than a walking tub of prepubescent lard who seeks to bully the nerdy Moranis. Now if Miner had tried to make a serious movie about childhood bullying, then BIG BULLY might have had something worthwhile to say about the angst of childhood insecurities. Now flash forward twenty years. Moranis and Arnold are both teachers in the same grammar school, and Arnold quickly reverts to the bully that he was. What makes this regression reprehensible is Arnold's justification that as a victim, Moranis thoroughly deserved his fate. What then follows is a ridiculous chase scene between prey and predator that offers no lasting insight into either demented personality. Julianne Phillips is a wasted toss in as Moranis' girlfriend. At the end, when director Miner seeks closure, the film ends in the uneasiest of endings, one that satisfied neither the desire for revenge nor one that offers justification for that revenge in the first place.

    I would compare this movie with such classics as Gone With The Wind. It puts a true story like Schindlers List to shame. I laughed, and I cried. I also urinated about a tablespoon from laughing. If I were to make a sequel to this classic, I would title it "Big Bully 2: Secret of the Oze." This movie has inspired me to go out and purchase an Evil Kanevil action figure. What really surprises me is the movie is based on a true story. It touched my heart like "Passion of the Christ." If Jesus was resurrected they would crucify him in this movie. Words cannot describe the natural Euphoria this movie makes me feel when I sit down to view it. Can a story get any better? Can humankind continue to create such beautiful things? Movies like this channel the human spirit onto the big screen. This movie should be dubbed as a national treasure so future generations can view the bountyful story of a tale of 2 men, who are at odds with one another, until they learn that they were meant for each other.

    There is no his picture under his name,and the scores for this movie is far too low.I really liked this movie. The music effect is specially great.What happened to you!Do I have to write 10 lines? I don't have much to say however.Well it's about a man who had been bullied by one of his old classmates. After he came back to his hometown, he found he is still scared by this old classmate "Fang". I myself was bullied by a shameless boy when I was in primary school.I still hate him even now.If I'll meet him again, I'll hit him with a hammer from back.Of course I don't think I will meet him again. And both the man and "fang" had a son. Interestingly his boy was still a "captive" of the fang. The fighting scene is wonderful.

    BIG BULLY, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy that you will never get tired of. When David (Rick Moranis) met Fang (Tom Arnold) again for the first time in several years, I got a little scared myself. This is because of what had happened between them years before. If you ask me, the performances were good, the direction was excellent, and the cast was perfectly chosen. However, what Fang did to David, even as an adult, was very childish especially since he managed to ruin David's date with Victoria (Julianne Phillips). Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy that you will never get tired of to any Rick Moranis or Tom Arnold fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a feel good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
