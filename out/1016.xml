    (Plot) An ex-con, and former U.S ranger kills a man out of self defense, but winds up serving a harsh prison sentence due to his military background. The day he is supposed to be released. He gets trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the convicts decide to hijack the plane. Can Nicolas Cage save the day? *Minor Spoilers* This movie is so dumb that it's not even funny. It's loud, in your face, and totally entertaining! Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie. I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen time Final Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest. 7.5/10

    Con air  is a delightful over the top action movie . There is such amount of absurd in this movie that it's hard to take anything here seriously .The movie all the time balances between trying to be serious and being a parody of itself. Some people who take life too seriously don't like this movie . It's their problem . For me it's a superb piece of trash entertainment done with charm . The movie is proud of own cheesiness and I can't help myself , but to enjoy the ride. There is never a moment when the movie tries to convince us "Hey ! This is real life" . No . "Con air" knows it's a fairytale for adults and wants only to entertain. There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( puts much likable ) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny  as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works). Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe). The movie is full of colorful characters . They fun to watch and likable (even if they are bad guys) . The movie is also never boring , there is always something going on . There is a LOT of humor and not too much of realism , but hey a good action movie doesn't have to be realistic. The movie wants to be a show and it is a SHOW . It holds up very well on repeated viewings . Watch this and watch Michael Bay movies and you will notice the difference between making a fun trash (Con air) and bad trash (Transformers). It's no wonder that Sylvester Stallone made a good choice with Simon West for the director of "Expendables 2". Lynrynd Skynryd " Sweet home Alabama" is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like "Con air" . I give it 8/10.

    one of the best action movies in the last 20 years, seems like Hollywood can't make an action movie like this anymore. An Army Ranger who comes home after serving his time in the military, get's into a fight one night and kills someone,, ordinarily it's self defense,, but since he's a Ranger, his hands are considered a lethal weapon,, so it's manslaughter. he serves his time,, get's his parole, and get's put on a military transport plane, just so happens the plane he's on is carrying the most deadliest criminals of current day, they are rounded up from prisons all over the country to put them in a "super max" prison for the worst of the worst,, the men take over the plane,, and from that point it's mayhem as they try to get away from the law. the law is played by John Cucack, who was excellent in this picture,, among the villains are John Malcovich,, Ving rhames, Steve Buscemei,, Danny Trejo, just to name a few,, loved this movie ,, it's moves at 100 mph for the most part, and was fun to watch.

    Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck. Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is  gasp  the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls. And being kicked in the balls never felt so good.

    If you enjoy movies with a lot of fast paced and intense action, some good acting, and a pretty good emotional vibe, then you will probably enjoy "Con Air". Filled in with some top-notch actors (Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi), you believe John Malkovich as the bad guy in this role and I would say that Malkovich probably delivered one of the best performances of a villain in an action movie of all time. You could tell that he was having a blast with the role and Malkovich himself is usually never disappointing whenever he gets an opportunity to have time on screen in any movie he's in. As for the plot, you don't really rely much on the plot in these sort of movies due to the action scenes that are provided in the film, although I do think that the movie handled itself well and had some pretty good emotional scenes, as well as some great action scenes as well. 7/10

    Con Air (1997) *** (out of 4) Newly released con Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) just wants to see his six-year-old daughter and wife for the first time but to do so he must battle a plane full of some of the worst criminals in the country including Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich). CON AIR doesn't have too many brains but it's certainly a highly entertaining film with some of the most memorable and fun characters that you're going to see in a picture like this. I certainly hopes no one comes to a movie like this expecting some sort of art-house picture because those folks will just be cheating themselves. Those wanting a lot of things blowing up will certainly be entertained by this. The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters. CON AIR isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a lot of fun and that's all that matters.

    You couldn't ask for much more even when it delivers much more than it should. This is one of those Action Movies that throws everything at you but the kitchen sink and then decides to do just that. The ridiculous ending may be too much but once it starts you can't get off the speeding ride. After all, you are already on board so there's not much choice. Not only is there enough action and mayhem, the over the top characters fit right in with the over the top action. Anyone who patronizes a Movie of this sort cannot complain because it is everything that is advertised. This is a frantic, loud, occasionally funny, Hoot. It has a number of quotable lines that would make any Comic Book fan proud. This is quite a trashy triumph of Hollywood excess and is better than most of its type because of its outrageous audacity and unrestrained recklessness. The talent here from the Director to the Stars all contribute. This is in a special category of Ultra-Budget escapism and it ranks in the upper echelons of mind-numbing madness with an atmosphere of testosterone and whimsy that is undeniably utter entertainment for those seeking this sort of thing.

    A group of prisoners considered dangerous are transferred to a new prison. On the plane traveling too "Cameron Poe" (Nicolas Cage), who just got probation and whose only desire is to be reunited with his wife and daughter. However, during the journey, "Poe" is involved in a meticulously plotted hijacking "Cyrus Grissom" (John Malkovich). It's a film with heavy doses of action and good performances by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, John Cusack and Steve Buscemi (making great psychopath). Nicolas Cage makes one of his best performances as "Cameron Poe" in an endless struggle to eliminate the other inmates. John Malkovich plays his character Cyrus "the virus" with admirable ease and reminding Buscemi "Hannibal Lector". Even John Cusack, has acceptable performance in a role that is not right. The action never fails and is always spectacular noticing that this is a big budget film. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. Furthermore, the level of violence is higher than usual. It's a long and thrilling movie, with humor, and non-stop action. It has Essential ingredients to make a movie like "The Rock" but even better. The landing in Las Vegas and its subsequent persecution are spectacular. It retrieves the type of pure action as "Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard" and that humor is so great that movie.

    What an awful movie. Everything in this movie that makes it vaguely interesting has been done in dozens of movies and with far better results. There is practically nothing original in Con Air. This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in "Total Recall" and far better action scenes in "First Blood" than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame. The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch "Fargo" or something. A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!

The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters. CON AIR isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a lot of fun and that's all that matters.

    You couldn't ask for much more even when it delivers much more than it should. This is one of those Action Movies that throws everything at you but the kitchen sink and then decides to do just that. The ridiculous ending may be too much but once it starts you can't get off the speeding ride. After all, you are already on board so there's not much choice. Not only is there enough action and mayhem, the over the top characters fit right in with the over the top action. Anyone who patronizes a Movie of this sort cannot complain because it is everything that is advertised. This is a frantic, loud, occasionally funny, Hoot. It has a number of quotable lines that would make any Comic Book fan proud. This is quite a trashy triumph of Hollywood excess and is better than most of its type because of its outrageous audacity and unrestrained recklessness. The talent here from the Director to the Stars all contribute. This is in a special category of Ultra-Budget escapism and it ranks in the upper echelons of mind-numbing madness with an atmosphere of testosterone and whimsy that is undeniably utter entertainment for those seeking this sort of thing.

    A group of prisoners considered dangerous are transferred to a new prison. On the plane traveling too "Cameron Poe" (Nicolas Cage), who just got probation and whose only desire is to be reunited with his wife and daughter. However, during the journey, "Poe" is involved in a meticulously plotted hijacking "Cyrus Grissom" (John Malkovich). It's a film with heavy doses of action and good performances by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, John Cusack and Steve Buscemi (making great psychopath). Nicolas Cage makes one of his best performances as "Cameron Poe" in an endless struggle to eliminate the other inmates. John Malkovich plays his character Cyrus "the virus" with admirable ease and reminding Buscemi "Hannibal Lector". Even John Cusack, has acceptable performance in a role that is not right. The action never fails and is always spectacular noticing that this is a big budget film. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. Furthermore, the level of violence is higher than usual. It's a long and thrilling movie, with humor, and non-stop action. It has Essential ingredients to make a movie like "The Rock" but even better. The landing in Las Vegas and its subsequent persecution are spectacular. It retrieves the type of pure action as "Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard" and that humor is so great that movie.

    What an awful movie. Everything in this movie that makes it vaguely interesting has been done in dozens of movies and with far better results. There is practically nothing original in Con Air. This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in "Total Recall" and far better action scenes in "First Blood" than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame. The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch "Fargo" or something. A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!

    (Plot) An ex-con, and former U.S ranger kills a man out of self defense, but winds up serving a harsh prison sentence due to his military background. The day he is supposed to be released. He gets trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the convicts decide to hijack the plane. Can Nicolas Cage save the day? *Minor Spoilers* This movie is so dumb that it's not even funny. It's loud, in your face, and totally entertaining! Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie. I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen time Final Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest. 7.5/10

    Con air  is a delightful over the top action movie . There is such amount of absurd in this movie that it's hard to take anything here seriously .The movie all the time balances between trying to be serious and being a parody of itself. Some people who take life too seriously don't like this movie . It's their problem . For me it's a superb piece of trash entertainment done with charm . The movie is proud of own cheesiness and I can't help myself , but to enjoy the ride. There is never a moment when the movie tries to convince us "Hey ! This is real life" . No . "Con air" knows it's a fairytale for adults and wants only to entertain. There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( puts much likable ) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny  as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works). Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe). The movie is full of colorful characters . They fun to watch and likable (even if they are bad guys) . The movie is also never boring , there is always something going on . There is a LOT of humor and not too much of realism , but hey a good action movie doesn't have to be realistic. The movie wants to be a show and it is a SHOW . It holds up very well on repeated viewings . Watch this and watch Michael Bay movies and you will notice the difference between making a fun trash (Con air) and bad trash (Transformers). It's no wonder that Sylvester Stallone made a good choice with Simon West for the director of "Expendables 2". Lynrynd Skynryd " Sweet home Alabama" is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like "Con air" . I give it 8/10.

    one of the best action movies in the last 20 years, seems like Hollywood can't make an action movie like this anymore. An Army Ranger who comes home after serving his time in the military, get's into a fight one night and kills someone,, ordinarily it's self defense,, but since he's a Ranger, his hands are considered a lethal weapon,, so it's manslaughter. he serves his time,, get's his parole, and get's put on a military transport plane, just so happens the plane he's on is carrying the most deadliest criminals of current day, they are rounded up from prisons all over the country to put them in a "super max" prison for the worst of the worst,, the men take over the plane,, and from that point it's mayhem as they try to get away from the law. the law is played by John Cucack, who was excellent in this picture,, among the villains are John Malcovich,, Ving rhames, Steve Buscemei,, Danny Trejo, just to name a few,, loved this movie ,, it's moves at 100 mph for the most part, and was fun to watch.

    Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck. Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is  gasp  the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls. And being kicked in the balls never felt so good.

    Simon West's 'Con Air' has aged well. When I saw it for the first time, almost a decade ago, I loved it, and now, whenever I end up watching it, I just get more & more involved. A Brilliant Action-Thriller, that great delivers entertainment! 'Con Air' Synopsis: A newly released ex-con and former US Ranger finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. 'Con Air' catches you from the word GO. The narrative completely grasps you & keeps the momentum alive till the very end. Scott Rosenberg's Screenplay is arresting & powerful. Simon West's Direction is technically appropriate. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are top-class. Performance-Wise: Nicolas Cage is fantastic, as always. He steals the show! John Cusack is dependable. John Malkovich is ruthless, while Steve Buscemi never disappoints. Ving Rhames is first-rate. Nick Chinlund is passable. Colm Meaney & M. C. Gainey are adequate. On the whole, 'Con Air' is One Cinematic Experience!

    If you enjoy movies with a lot of fast paced and intense action, some good acting, and a pretty good emotional vibe, then you will probably enjoy "Con Air". Filled in with some top-notch actors (Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi), you believe John Malkovich as the bad guy in this role and I would say that Malkovich probably delivered one of the best performances of a villain in an action movie of all time. You could tell that he was having a blast with the role and Malkovich himself is usually never disappointing whenever he gets an opportunity to have time on screen in any movie he's in. As for the plot, you don't really rely much on the plot in these sort of movies due to the action scenes that are provided in the film, although I do think that the movie handled itself well and had some pretty good emotional scenes, as well as some great action scenes as well. 7/10

    Con Air (1997) *** (out of 4) Newly released con Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) just wants to see his six-year-old daughter and wife for the first time but to do so he must battle a plane full of some of the worst criminals in the country including Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich). CON AIR doesn't have too many brains but it's certainly a highly entertaining film with some of the most memorable and fun characters that you're going to see in a picture like this. I certainly hopes no one comes to a movie like this expecting some sort of art-house picture because those folks will just be cheating themselves. Those wanting a lot of things blowing up will certainly be entertained by this. The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters. CON AIR isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a lot of fun and that's all that matters.

Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is  gasp  the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls.

    Simon West's 'Con Air' has aged well. When I saw it for the first time, almost a decade ago, I loved it, and now, whenever I end up watching it, I just get more & more involved. A Brilliant Action-Thriller, that great delivers entertainment! 'Con Air' Synopsis: A newly released ex-con and former US Ranger finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. 'Con Air' catches you from the word GO. The narrative completely grasps you & keeps the momentum alive till the very end. Scott Rosenberg's Screenplay is arresting & powerful. Simon West's Direction is technically appropriate. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are top-class. Performance-Wise: Nicolas Cage is fantastic, as always. He steals the show! John Cusack is dependable. John Malkovich is ruthless, while Steve Buscemi never disappoints. Ving Rhames is first-rate. Nick Chinlund is passable. Colm Meaney & M. C. Gainey are adequate. On the whole, 'Con Air' is One Cinematic Experience!

    If you enjoy movies with a lot of fast paced and intense action, some good acting, and a pretty good emotional vibe, then you will probably enjoy "Con Air". Filled in with some top-notch actors (Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi), you believe John Malkovich as the bad guy in this role and I would say that Malkovich probably delivered one of the best performances of a villain in an action movie of all time. You could tell that he was having a blast with the role and Malkovich himself is usually never disappointing whenever he gets an opportunity to have time on screen in any movie he's in. As for the plot, you don't really rely much on the plot in these sort of movies due to the action scenes that are provided in the film, although I do think that the movie handled itself well and had some pretty good emotional scenes, as well as some great action scenes as well. 7/10

    Con Air (1997) *** (out of 4) Newly released con Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) just wants to see his six-year-old daughter and wife for the first time but to do so he must battle a plane full of some of the worst criminals in the country including Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich). CON AIR doesn't have too many brains but it's certainly a highly entertaining film with some of the most memorable and fun characters that you're going to see in a picture like this. I certainly hopes no one comes to a movie like this expecting some sort of art-house picture because those folks will just be cheating themselves. Those wanting a lot of things blowing up will certainly be entertained by this. The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters. CON AIR isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a lot of fun and that's all that matters.

    You couldn't ask for much more even when it delivers much more than it should. This is one of those Action Movies that throws everything at you but the kitchen sink and then decides to do just that. The ridiculous ending may be too much but once it starts you can't get off the speeding ride. After all, you are already on board so there's not much choice. Not only is there enough action and mayhem, the over the top characters fit right in with the over the top action. Anyone who patronizes a Movie of this sort cannot complain because it is everything that is advertised. This is a frantic, loud, occasionally funny, Hoot. It has a number of quotable lines that would make any Comic Book fan proud. This is quite a trashy triumph of Hollywood excess and is better than most of its type because of its outrageous audacity and unrestrained recklessness. The talent here from the Director to the Stars all contribute. This is in a special category of Ultra-Budget escapism and it ranks in the upper echelons of mind-numbing madness with an atmosphere of testosterone and whimsy that is undeniably utter entertainment for those seeking this sort of thing.

    A group of prisoners considered dangerous are transferred to a new prison. On the plane traveling too "Cameron Poe" (Nicolas Cage), who just got probation and whose only desire is to be reunited with his wife and daughter. However, during the journey, "Poe" is involved in a meticulously plotted hijacking "Cyrus Grissom" (John Malkovich). It's a film with heavy doses of action and good performances by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, John Cusack and Steve Buscemi (making great psychopath). Nicolas Cage makes one of his best performances as "Cameron Poe" in an endless struggle to eliminate the other inmates. John Malkovich plays his character Cyrus "the virus" with admirable ease and reminding Buscemi "Hannibal Lector". Even John Cusack, has acceptable performance in a role that is not right. The action never fails and is always spectacular noticing that this is a big budget film. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. Furthermore, the level of violence is higher than usual. It's a long and thrilling movie, with humor, and non-stop action. It has Essential ingredients to make a movie like "The Rock" but even better. The landing in Las Vegas and its subsequent persecution are spectacular. It retrieves the type of pure action as "Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard" and that humor is so great that movie.

    What an awful movie. Everything in this movie that makes it vaguely interesting has been done in dozens of movies and with far better results. There is practically nothing original in Con Air. This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in "Total Recall" and far better action scenes in "First Blood" than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame. The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch "Fargo" or something. A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!

    (Plot) An ex-con, and former U.S ranger kills a man out of self defense, but winds up serving a harsh prison sentence due to his military background. The day he is supposed to be released. He gets trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the convicts decide to hijack the plane. Can Nicolas Cage save the day? *Minor Spoilers* This movie is so dumb that it's not even funny. It's loud, in your face, and totally entertaining! Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie. I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen time Final Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest. 7.5/10

    Con air  is a delightful over the top action movie . There is such amount of absurd in this movie that it's hard to take anything here seriously .The movie all the time balances between trying to be serious and being a parody of itself. Some people who take life too seriously don't like this movie . It's their problem . For me it's a superb piece of trash entertainment done with charm . The movie is proud of own cheesiness and I can't help myself , but to enjoy the ride. There is never a moment when the movie tries to convince us "Hey ! This is real life" . No . "Con air" knows it's a fairytale for adults and wants only to entertain. There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( puts much likable ) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny  as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works). Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe). The movie is full of colorful characters . They fun to watch and likable (even if they are bad guys) . The movie is also never boring , there is always something going on . There is a LOT of humor and not too much of realism , but hey a good action movie doesn't have to be realistic. The movie wants to be a show and it is a SHOW . It holds up very well on repeated viewings . Watch this and watch Michael Bay movies and you will notice the difference between making a fun trash (Con air) and bad trash (Transformers). It's no wonder that Sylvester Stallone made a good choice with Simon West for the director of "Expendables 2". Lynrynd Skynryd " Sweet home Alabama" is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like "Con air" . I give it 8/10.

    one of the best action movies in the last 20 years, seems like Hollywood can't make an action movie like this anymore. An Army Ranger who comes home after serving his time in the military, get's into a fight one night and kills someone,, ordinarily it's self defense,, but since he's a Ranger, his hands are considered a lethal weapon,, so it's manslaughter. he serves his time,, get's his parole, and get's put on a military transport plane, just so happens the plane he's on is carrying the most deadliest criminals of current day, they are rounded up from prisons all over the country to put them in a "super max" prison for the worst of the worst,, the men take over the plane,, and from that point it's mayhem as they try to get away from the law. the law is played by John Cucack, who was excellent in this picture,, among the villains are John Malcovich,, Ving rhames, Steve Buscemei,, Danny Trejo, just to name a few,, loved this movie ,, it's moves at 100 mph for the most part, and was fun to watch.

    Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck. Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is  gasp  the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls. And being kicked in the balls never felt so good.

    Simon West's 'Con Air' has aged well. When I saw it for the first time, almost a decade ago, I loved it, and now, whenever I end up watching it, I just get more & more involved. A Brilliant Action-Thriller, that great delivers entertainment! 'Con Air' Synopsis: A newly released ex-con and former US Ranger finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. 'Con Air' catches you from the word GO. The narrative completely grasps you & keeps the momentum alive till the very end. Scott Rosenberg's Screenplay is arresting & powerful. Simon West's Direction is technically appropriate. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are top-class. Performance-Wise: Nicolas Cage is fantastic, as always. He steals the show! John Cusack is dependable. John Malkovich is ruthless, while Steve Buscemi never disappoints. Ving Rhames is first-rate. Nick Chinlund is passable. Colm Meaney & M. C. Gainey are adequate.

    one of the best action movies in the last 20 years, seems like Hollywood can't make an action movie like this anymore. An Army Ranger who comes home after serving his time in the military, get's into a fight one night and kills someone,, ordinarily it's self defense,, but since he's a Ranger, his hands are considered a lethal weapon,, so it's manslaughter. he serves his time,, get's his parole, and get's put on a military transport plane, just so happens the plane he's on is carrying the most deadliest criminals of current day, they are rounded up from prisons all over the country to put them in a "super max" prison for the worst of the worst,, the men take over the plane,, and from that point it's mayhem as they try to get away from the law. the law is played by John Cucack, who was excellent in this picture,, among the villains are John Malcovich,, Ving rhames, Steve Buscemei,, Danny Trejo, just to name a few,, loved this movie ,, it's moves at 100 mph for the most part, and was fun to watch.

    Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck. Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is  gasp  the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls. And being kicked in the balls never felt so good.

    Simon West's 'Con Air' has aged well. When I saw it for the first time, almost a decade ago, I loved it, and now, whenever I end up watching it, I just get more & more involved. A Brilliant Action-Thriller, that great delivers entertainment! 'Con Air' Synopsis: A newly released ex-con and former US Ranger finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. 'Con Air' catches you from the word GO. The narrative completely grasps you & keeps the momentum alive till the very end. Scott Rosenberg's Screenplay is arresting & powerful. Simon West's Direction is technically appropriate. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are top-class. Performance-Wise: Nicolas Cage is fantastic, as always. He steals the show! John Cusack is dependable. John Malkovich is ruthless, while Steve Buscemi never disappoints. Ving Rhames is first-rate. Nick Chinlund is passable. Colm Meaney & M. C. Gainey are adequate. On the whole, 'Con Air' is One Cinematic Experience!

    If you enjoy movies with a lot of fast paced and intense action, some good acting, and a pretty good emotional vibe, then you will probably enjoy "Con Air". Filled in with some top-notch actors (Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi), you believe John Malkovich as the bad guy in this role and I would say that Malkovich probably delivered one of the best performances of a villain in an action movie of all time. You could tell that he was having a blast with the role and Malkovich himself is usually never disappointing whenever he gets an opportunity to have time on screen in any movie he's in. As for the plot, you don't really rely much on the plot in these sort of movies due to the action scenes that are provided in the film, although I do think that the movie handled itself well and had some pretty good emotional scenes, as well as some great action scenes as well. 7/10

    Con Air (1997) *** (out of 4) Newly released con Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) just wants to see his six-year-old daughter and wife for the first time but to do so he must battle a plane full of some of the worst criminals in the country including Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich). CON AIR doesn't have too many brains but it's certainly a highly entertaining film with some of the most memorable and fun characters that you're going to see in a picture like this. I certainly hopes no one comes to a movie like this expecting some sort of art-house picture because those folks will just be cheating themselves. Those wanting a lot of things blowing up will certainly be entertained by this. The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters. CON AIR isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a lot of fun and that's all that matters.

    You couldn't ask for much more even when it delivers much more than it should. This is one of those Action Movies that throws everything at you but the kitchen sink and then decides to do just that. The ridiculous ending may be too much but once it starts you can't get off the speeding ride. After all, you are already on board so there's not much choice. Not only is there enough action and mayhem, the over the top characters fit right in with the over the top action. Anyone who patronizes a Movie of this sort cannot complain because it is everything that is advertised. This is a frantic, loud, occasionally funny, Hoot. It has a number of quotable lines that would make any Comic Book fan proud. This is quite a trashy triumph of Hollywood excess and is better than most of its type because of its outrageous audacity and unrestrained recklessness. The talent here from the Director to the Stars all contribute. This is in a special category of Ultra-Budget escapism and it ranks in the upper echelons of mind-numbing madness with an atmosphere of testosterone and whimsy that is undeniably utter entertainment for those seeking this sort of thing.

    A group of prisoners considered dangerous are transferred to a new prison. On the plane traveling too "Cameron Poe" (Nicolas Cage), who just got probation and whose only desire is to be reunited with his wife and daughter. However, during the journey, "Poe" is involved in a meticulously plotted hijacking "Cyrus Grissom" (John Malkovich). It's a film with heavy doses of action and good performances by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, John Cusack and Steve Buscemi (making great psychopath). Nicolas Cage makes one of his best performances as "Cameron Poe" in an endless struggle to eliminate the other inmates. John Malkovich plays his character Cyrus "the virus" with admirable ease and reminding Buscemi "Hannibal Lector". Even John Cusack, has acceptable performance in a role that is not right. The action never fails and is always spectacular noticing that this is a big budget film. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. Furthermore, the level of violence is higher than usual. It's a long and thrilling movie, with humor, and non-stop action. It has Essential ingredients to make a movie like "The Rock" but even better. The landing in Las Vegas and its subsequent persecution are spectacular. It retrieves the type of pure action as "Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard" and that humor is so great that movie.

    What an awful movie. Everything in this movie that makes it vaguely interesting has been done in dozens of movies and with far better results. There is practically nothing original in Con Air. This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in "Total Recall" and far better action scenes in "First Blood" than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame. The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch "Fargo" or something. A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!

    (Plot) An ex-con, and former U.S ranger kills a man out of self defense, but winds up serving a harsh prison sentence due to his military background. The day he is supposed to be released. He gets trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the convicts decide to hijack the plane. Can Nicolas Cage save the day? *Minor Spoilers* This movie is so dumb that it's not even funny. It's loud, in your face, and totally entertaining! Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie. I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen time Final Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest. 7.5/10

    Con air  is a delightful over the top action movie . There is such amount of absurd in this movie that it's hard to take anything here seriously .The movie all the time balances between trying to be serious and being a parody of itself. Some people who take life too seriously don't like this movie . It's their problem . For me it's a superb piece of trash entertainment done with charm . The movie is proud of own cheesiness and I can't help myself , but to enjoy the ride. There is never a moment when the movie tries to convince us "Hey ! This is real life" . No . "Con air" knows it's a fairytale for adults and wants only to entertain. There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( puts much likable ) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny  as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works). Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe). The movie is full of colorful characters . They fun to watch and likable (even if they are bad guys) . The movie is also never boring , there is always something going on . There is a LOT of humor and not too much of realism , but hey a good action movie doesn't have to be realistic. The movie wants to be a show and it is a SHOW . It holds up very well on repeated viewings . Watch this and watch Michael Bay movies and you will notice the difference between making a fun trash (Con air) and bad trash (Transformers). It's no wonder that Sylvester Stallone made a good choice with Simon West for the director of "Expendables 2". Lynrynd Skynryd " Sweet home Alabama" is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like "Con air" . I give it 8/10.

Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is  gasp  the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls.

Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen time Final Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest. 7.5/10

    Con air  is a delightful over the top action movie . There is such amount of absurd in this movie that it's hard to take anything here seriously .The movie all the time balances between trying to be serious and being a parody of itself. Some people who take life too seriously don't like this movie . It's their problem . For me it's a superb piece of trash entertainment done with charm . The movie is proud of own cheesiness and I can't help myself , but to enjoy the ride. There is never a moment when the movie tries to convince us "Hey ! This is real life" . No . "Con air" knows it's a fairytale for adults and wants only to entertain. There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( puts much likable ) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny  as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works). Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe). The movie is full of colorful characters . They fun to watch and likable (even if they are bad guys) . The movie is also never boring , there is always something going on . There is a LOT of humor and not too much of realism , but hey a good action movie doesn't have to be realistic. The movie wants to be a show and it is a SHOW . It holds up very well on repeated viewings . Watch this and watch Michael Bay movies and you will notice the difference between making a fun trash (Con air) and bad trash (Transformers). It's no wonder that Sylvester Stallone made a good choice with Simon West for the director of "Expendables 2". Lynrynd Skynryd " Sweet home Alabama" is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like "Con air" . I give it 8/10.

    one of the best action movies in the last 20 years, seems like Hollywood can't make an action movie like this anymore. An Army Ranger who comes home after serving his time in the military, get's into a fight one night and kills someone,, ordinarily it's self defense,, but since he's a Ranger, his hands are considered a lethal weapon,, so it's manslaughter. he serves his time,, get's his parole, and get's put on a military transport plane, just so happens the plane he's on is carrying the most deadliest criminals of current day, they are rounded up from prisons all over the country to put them in a "super max" prison for the worst of the worst,, the men take over the plane,, and from that point it's mayhem as they try to get away from the law. the law is played by John Cucack, who was excellent in this picture,, among the villains are John Malcovich,, Ving rhames, Steve Buscemei,, Danny Trejo, just to name a few,, loved this movie ,, it's moves at 100 mph for the most part, and was fun to watch.

    Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck. Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is  gasp  the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls. And being kicked in the balls never felt so good.

    Simon West's 'Con Air' has aged well. When I saw it for the first time, almost a decade ago, I loved it, and now, whenever I end up watching it, I just get more & more involved. A Brilliant Action-Thriller, that great delivers entertainment! 'Con Air' Synopsis: A newly released ex-con and former US Ranger finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. 'Con Air' catches you from the word GO. The narrative completely grasps you & keeps the momentum alive till the very end. Scott Rosenberg's Screenplay is arresting & powerful. Simon West's Direction is technically appropriate. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are top-class. Performance-Wise: Nicolas Cage is fantastic, as always. He steals the show! John Cusack is dependable. John Malkovich is ruthless, while Steve Buscemi never disappoints. Ving Rhames is first-rate. Nick Chinlund is passable. Colm Meaney & M. C. Gainey are adequate. On the whole, 'Con Air' is One Cinematic Experience!

    If you enjoy movies with a lot of fast paced and intense action, some good acting, and a pretty good emotional vibe, then you will probably enjoy "Con Air". Filled in with some top-notch actors (Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi), you believe John Malkovich as the bad guy in this role and I would say that Malkovich probably delivered one of the best performances of a villain in an action movie of all time. You could tell that he was having a blast with the role and Malkovich himself is usually never disappointing whenever he gets an opportunity to have time on screen in any movie he's in. As for the plot, you don't really rely much on the plot in these sort of movies due to the action scenes that are provided in the film, although I do think that the movie handled itself well and had some pretty good emotional scenes, as well as some great action scenes as well. 7/10

    Con Air (1997) *** (out of 4) Newly released con Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) just wants to see his six-year-old daughter and wife for the first time but to do so he must battle a plane full of some of the worst criminals in the country including Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich). CON AIR doesn't have too many brains but it's certainly a highly entertaining film with some of the most memorable and fun characters that you're going to see in a picture like this. I certainly hopes no one comes to a movie like this expecting some sort of art-house picture because those folks will just be cheating themselves. Those wanting a lot of things blowing up will certainly be entertained by this. The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters. CON AIR isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a lot of fun and that's all that matters.

    You couldn't ask for much more even when it delivers much more than it should. This is one of those Action Movies that throws everything at you but the kitchen sink and then decides to do just that. The ridiculous ending may be too much but once it starts you can't get off the speeding ride. After all, you are already on board so there's not much choice. Not only is there enough action and mayhem, the over the top characters fit right in with the over the top action. Anyone who patronizes a Movie of this sort cannot complain because it is everything that is advertised. This is a frantic, loud, occasionally funny, Hoot. It has a number of quotable lines that would make any Comic Book fan proud. This is quite a trashy triumph of Hollywood excess and is better than most of its type because of its outrageous audacity and unrestrained recklessness. The talent here from the Director to the Stars all contribute. This is in a special category of Ultra-Budget escapism and it ranks in the upper echelons of mind-numbing madness with an atmosphere of testosterone and whimsy that is undeniably utter entertainment for those seeking this sort of thing.

    A group of prisoners considered dangerous are transferred to a new prison. On the plane traveling too "Cameron Poe" (Nicolas Cage), who just got probation and whose only desire is to be reunited with his wife and daughter. However, during the journey, "Poe" is involved in a meticulously plotted hijacking "Cyrus Grissom" (John Malkovich). It's a film with heavy doses of action and good performances by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, John Cusack and Steve Buscemi (making great psychopath). Nicolas Cage makes one of his best performances as "Cameron Poe" in an endless struggle to eliminate the other inmates. John Malkovich plays his character Cyrus "the virus" with admirable ease and reminding Buscemi "Hannibal Lector". Even John Cusack, has acceptable performance in a role that is not right. The action never fails and is always spectacular noticing that this is a big budget film. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. Furthermore, the level of violence is higher than usual. It's a long and thrilling movie, with humor, and non-stop action. It has Essential ingredients to make a movie like "The Rock" but even better. The landing in Las Vegas and its subsequent persecution are spectacular. It retrieves the type of pure action as "Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard" and that humor is so great that movie.

    What an awful movie. Everything in this movie that makes it vaguely interesting has been done in dozens of movies and with far better results. There is practically nothing original in Con Air. This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in "Total Recall" and far better action scenes in "First Blood" than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame. The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch "Fargo" or something. A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!

    (Plot) An ex-con, and former U.S ranger kills a man out of self defense, but winds up serving a harsh prison sentence due to his military background. The day he is supposed to be released. He gets trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the convicts decide to hijack the plane. Can Nicolas Cage save the day? *Minor Spoilers* This movie is so dumb that it's not even funny. It's loud, in your face, and totally entertaining! Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie. I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen time Final Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest. 7.5/10

This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in "Total Recall" and far better action scenes in "First Blood" than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame. The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch "Fargo" or something. A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!

    (Plot) An ex-con, and former U.S ranger kills a man out of self defense, but winds up serving a harsh prison sentence due to his military background. The day he is supposed to be released. He gets trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the convicts decide to hijack the plane. Can Nicolas Cage save the day? *Minor Spoilers* This movie is so dumb that it's not even funny. It's loud, in your face, and totally entertaining! Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie. I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen time Final Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest. 7.5/10

    Con air  is a delightful over the top action movie . There is such amount of absurd in this movie that it's hard to take anything here seriously .The movie all the time balances between trying to be serious and being a parody of itself. Some people who take life too seriously don't like this movie . It's their problem . For me it's a superb piece of trash entertainment done with charm . The movie is proud of own cheesiness and I can't help myself , but to enjoy the ride. There is never a moment when the movie tries to convince us "Hey ! This is real life" . No . "Con air" knows it's a fairytale for adults and wants only to entertain. There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( puts much likable ) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny  as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works). Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe). The movie is full of colorful characters . They fun to watch and likable (even if they are bad guys) . The movie is also never boring , there is always something going on . There is a LOT of humor and not too much of realism , but hey a good action movie doesn't have to be realistic. The movie wants to be a show and it is a SHOW . It holds up very well on repeated viewings . Watch this and watch Michael Bay movies and you will notice the difference between making a fun trash (Con air) and bad trash (Transformers). It's no wonder that Sylvester Stallone made a good choice with Simon West for the director of "Expendables 2". Lynrynd Skynryd " Sweet home Alabama" is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like "Con air" . I give it 8/10.

    one of the best action movies in the last 20 years, seems like Hollywood can't make an action movie like this anymore. An Army Ranger who comes home after serving his time in the military, get's into a fight one night and kills someone,, ordinarily it's self defense,, but since he's a Ranger, his hands are considered a lethal weapon,, so it's manslaughter. he serves his time,, get's his parole, and get's put on a military transport plane, just so happens the plane he's on is carrying the most deadliest criminals of current day, they are rounded up from prisons all over the country to put them in a "super max" prison for the worst of the worst,, the men take over the plane,, and from that point it's mayhem as they try to get away from the law. the law is played by John Cucack, who was excellent in this picture,, among the villains are John Malcovich,, Ving rhames, Steve Buscemei,, Danny Trejo, just to name a few,, loved this movie ,, it's moves at 100 mph for the most part, and was fun to watch.

    Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck. Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is  gasp  the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls. And being kicked in the balls never felt so good.

    Simon West's 'Con Air' has aged well. When I saw it for the first time, almost a decade ago, I loved it, and now, whenever I end up watching it, I just get more & more involved. A Brilliant Action-Thriller, that great delivers entertainment! 'Con Air' Synopsis: A newly released ex-con and former US Ranger finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. 'Con Air' catches you from the word GO. The narrative completely grasps you & keeps the momentum alive till the very end. Scott Rosenberg's Screenplay is arresting & powerful. Simon West's Direction is technically appropriate. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are top-class. Performance-Wise: Nicolas Cage is fantastic, as always. He steals the show! John Cusack is dependable. John Malkovich is ruthless, while Steve Buscemi never disappoints. Ving Rhames is first-rate. Nick Chinlund is passable. Colm Meaney & M. C. Gainey are adequate. On the whole, 'Con Air' is One Cinematic Experience!

    If you enjoy movies with a lot of fast paced and intense action, some good acting, and a pretty good emotional vibe, then you will probably enjoy "Con Air". Filled in with some top-notch actors (Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi), you believe John Malkovich as the bad guy in this role and I would say that Malkovich probably delivered one of the best performances of a villain in an action movie of all time. You could tell that he was having a blast with the role and Malkovich himself is usually never disappointing whenever he gets an opportunity to have time on screen in any movie he's in. As for the plot, you don't really rely much on the plot in these sort of movies due to the action scenes that are provided in the film, although I do think that the movie handled itself well and had some pretty good emotional scenes, as well as some great action scenes as well. 7/10

    Con Air (1997) *** (out of 4) Newly released con Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) just wants to see his six-year-old daughter and wife for the first time but to do so he must battle a plane full of some of the worst criminals in the country including Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich). CON AIR doesn't have too many brains but it's certainly a highly entertaining film with some of the most memorable and fun characters that you're going to see in a picture like this. I certainly hopes no one comes to a movie like this expecting some sort of art-house picture because those folks will just be cheating themselves. Those wanting a lot of things blowing up will certainly be entertained by this. The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters. CON AIR isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a lot of fun and that's all that matters.

    You couldn't ask for much more even when it delivers much more than it should. This is one of those Action Movies that throws everything at you but the kitchen sink and then decides to do just that. The ridiculous ending may be too much but once it starts you can't get off the speeding ride. After all, you are already on board so there's not much choice. Not only is there enough action and mayhem, the over the top characters fit right in with the over the top action. Anyone who patronizes a Movie of this sort cannot complain because it is everything that is advertised. This is a frantic, loud, occasionally funny, Hoot. It has a number of quotable lines that would make any Comic Book fan proud. This is quite a trashy triumph of Hollywood excess and is better than most of its type because of its outrageous audacity and unrestrained recklessness. The talent here from the Director to the Stars all contribute. This is in a special category of Ultra-Budget escapism and it ranks in the upper echelons of mind-numbing madness with an atmosphere of testosterone and whimsy that is undeniably utter entertainment for those seeking this sort of thing.

    A group of prisoners considered dangerous are transferred to a new prison. On the plane traveling too "Cameron Poe" (Nicolas Cage), who just got probation and whose only desire is to be reunited with his wife and daughter. However, during the journey, "Poe" is involved in a meticulously plotted hijacking "Cyrus Grissom" (John Malkovich). It's a film with heavy doses of action and good performances by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, John Cusack and Steve Buscemi (making great psychopath). Nicolas Cage makes one of his best performances as "Cameron Poe" in an endless struggle to eliminate the other inmates. John Malkovich plays his character Cyrus "the virus" with admirable ease and reminding Buscemi "Hannibal Lector". Even John Cusack, has acceptable performance in a role that is not right. The action never fails and is always spectacular noticing that this is a big budget film. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. Furthermore, the level of violence is higher than usual. It's a long and thrilling movie, with humor, and non-stop action. It has Essential ingredients to make a movie like "The Rock" but even better. The landing in Las Vegas and its subsequent persecution are spectacular. It retrieves the type of pure action as "Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard" and that humor is so great that movie.

    What an awful movie. Everything in this movie that makes it vaguely interesting has been done in dozens of movies and with far better results. There is practically nothing original in Con Air. This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in "Total Recall" and far better action scenes in "First Blood" than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame. The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch "Fargo" or something. A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!
