    The Killer is one of the few action movies in the 80's that not only had spectacular action but also a lot of heart, soul, and emotion. It's also one of if not the most influential action films of all time, up there with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and The Terminator. But why is that, let's find out! First of all, The Killer is extremely stylized. It's action sequences aren't just typical Hollywood shootouts with explosions, machine guns, and one-liners. There's a lot of visual poetry going on here with white doves flying around and a lot of slow-motion being used. The action isn't the only thing that's stylized about this film, it's drama is also very stylized. John Woo's movies have a recurring theme of men bonding and becoming like brothers and it's very present here. In Hollywood, this might not happen because it's " too gay " but Woo seems to love men bonding becoming like brothers so all of the friendships in his films feel very genuine and real. The dramatic scenes in this film can come off melodramatic to some people but I think it's very powerful because of how believable their relationships are. Secondly, it actually has a good, dramatic story with complex characters and genuine emotions. Face it, most action movies are just simple escapist entertainment with a nice happy ending to put a smile on your face at the end. But The Killer is a little different. While it has all the action you want in an action movie, the script focuses more on developing our protagonist, Jeffrey(Chow-yun Fat) who is an assassin who accidentally blinds a singer with a muzzle flash in his gun during one of his assassination missions so he accepts one last job, hoping to use the money to help her recover her eyesight but he ends up getting betrayed by his Triad boss who now wants him dead. What's fascinating about his character is that he doesn't seem to be a bad man who just wants a new path but he seems to be a man with a good heart but made some bad choices due to his own questionable morality. He said to Jenny(the girl he blinded) he once thought that they deserved it but now he thinks differently. Perhaps he started his career not because of money but because he thinks he's doing something right but throughout this film, he learns that violence brings nothing but bloodshed. Almost every shootout in this film, something goes wrong for him. And by the end of the movie, he says he can't do this anymore and it's making him sick. In contrast, we have the cop learning an opposite lesson, that of you can't always follow the rules to solve things in the world. He starts out on a quest to take down Jeffrey but he slowly learns that he isn't just another assassin who kills for money but also a man with heart. So he breaks the rules by helping him on his mission to protect and recover Jenny's eyesight. The message of this movie is that ultimately the world isn't black and white and it's impressive how well- written this film is considering Woo was writing it as he was going along. Lastly, this movie is very brave with its ending. Most Hollywood flicks wouldn't go with this ending but since the Hong Kong film industry is more accepting of unhappy endings, this is what happens at the end. After a massive shootout in the church, Jeffrey gets shot and killed by the Triad boss but the cop ends up avenging Jeffrey even though the man surrendered thus getting arrested. This ending left me a little sad after watching this movie but I think the point of this ending was that Jeffrey ultimately realizes his sins too late and thus gets punished in the worst way possible in the end. The cop makes the sacrifice he does because he realizes that him getting arrested wasn't good enough and sometimes you gotta break the rules to make the world a better place. The Killer is stylish, exciting, thoughtful, intelligent, and wonderfully well-nuanced and because of that, I am gonna give it a 9/10.

    The Killer is perhaps the most melodramatic of John Woo's blood operas, but there's an inexplicable charm to his work that never lets it come off as manipulative or cloying. Partly because Woo seems to be an incredibly thoughtful, merciful man who gives his scripts a great deal of poetic irony, and partly because it's very obviously a modern take on an entire culture of chivalry & swordplay stories; unlike most sentimentalism, it's not empty. There's a bit of a camp appeal to Chow Yun-Fat mowing down 50 guys in a clip considering the movie's all about mercy and Christian pacifism, but it's so sincere and lovable. Woo branches out a little here and in effect sorta comes in to his own. There's a gaudy French new wave vibe to the visuals that perfectly matches the unrealistic, Romantic heights of the drama, and the violence takes the "sliiiiightly over-the-top" action of A Better Tomorrow to such an absurdly ballistic extent that it looks more like some fireworks+martial arts combination than gunplay. Yet, stuff like The Matrix remains a bad caricature of this movie; there's still a grit and old-fashioned physicality to Woo's action you don't see in Hollywood. Performances are perfectly broad. There's one notable exchange with no dialogue, just facial expressions, and although the actors do mug the camera a bit, it's perfect--they're screaming at each other without words. The pyrotechnics of the gun battles are obviously glamourized, yet Woo does his best to give it all a certain moral weight. It's an interesting juxtaposition; when the protagonist flips a guy over a counter and stabs him right in the spine with a butcher knife, it seems so much worse than the guys catching bullets in their skulls by the truckload, and that says volumes about the movie's intentions as well as our own expectations when it comes to this kind of violence. There's a kind of inevitable hypocrisy to such an uneasy negotiation between excessive pulp and romantic chivalry, but nothing feels cheap.

    An Asian Superstar Director and Actor, John Woo and Chow Yun Fat, were burning up screens and thrilling Movie Goers before coming to America. Their reputations precede them. Their reception here was nothing less than phenomenal. Critics and Audiences wallowed in the over the top accentuation of Violence coated with maudlin Melodrama. As History would have it, American Movies were never the same. This unabashed Director was supremely influential and his Films, both Hong Kong and American have a distinct Style that cannot be dismissed or overlooked. He delivers Movies infused with adrenaline and patched with Pathos. They all have an unreal feel and thus are set apart from the Genre they inhabit. The Killer and some of his other Hong Kong Films are rough and raw Woo, lacking the Hollywood budgets but never lacking Entertainment Value or interest. This one could be considered his best Non-American Movie but that takes nothing away from the others. They are all stamped with a saturation of take-notice Expressionistic Art and all magnetically draw one into its World of exaggeration and excess. There is much to admire in this Film with its constant ping-pong of outrageous gun battles and deep emotional compassion. There is an over abundance of everything and that makes this a very different experience than the average Action/Crime Flick. John Woo applies his Artistic strokes with a powerful high compression air-brush and never uses a single-hair stroke. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is the appeal.

    The Killer was a classic crime drama about a hit-man named Ah Jong (played by Chow Yun Fat) who decides he's had enough and wants to leave the life of an assassin for good unfortunately during the hit something unexpected occurs. A young singer named Jenny (played by Sally Yeh) is there at the wrong place at the wrong time and Ah Jong accidentally injures her eyes. This prompts Ah Jong to hold off his retirement to take one more job to pay for Jenny's operation to get her vision back to normal. This was a classic crime/action drama and I thought there really was chemistry between Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh along with the great performances of many of the cast at least including Danny Lee who is on par with Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh with his performance of Inspector Li Ying of the Hong Kong Police!

    Many people that view this movie today will probably think of it as cheesy and overrated, especially now with all the slick CGI action films out left and right. At the time that the film came out, it was pretty revolutionary. It put John Woo on the map for his cinematic style that would influence many films to come and to this date, it's clear his influence hasn't left. In my opinion, this movie is a classic in the action genre. John Woo made A Better Tomorrow Parts 1 & 2 prior to The Killer, and they were definitely good, but The Killer reached perfection when compared. His slick camera moves and seamless action were polished. When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film. That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old. To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it. Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED. As for his Hollywood films, I really don't consider them in the same league as his original films. What happened to the days when there were actual stunts and real explosions???

    I'm a 21 year old male. My father had a DVD of this on the shelf, and having never heard of it, I looked it up on IMDb... 7.9 eh? I'll give it a try. Being from 1989, I didn't expect much, but nothing this bad. The audio is atrocious. Guns sound fake, the punch noises are terrible, bad guys are apparently blind, and virtually none of the characters decisions make sense. The only reason I recommend watching this is to appreciate how far modern cinema has come (or how crappy foreign cinema was). Maybe if you're older than I am, it's fun to reminisce about when you saw this movie ages ago, but this is complete trash compared to any decent action film of the past 15 years. 1 star for 2013. Please, learn from my mistake and don't waste your time.

    A hit-man (Yun Fat) blinds a young woman during a violent assassination in a piano bar, and remorseful of his actions, seeks to atone for his crime by helping her to regain her sight. During the process he discovers he's no longer cut-out for his line of work, but before he can retire to the country, he must out-manoeuvre a relentless rogue detective (Lee) and contest the double-crossing mobster hell-bent on establishing his dominance. Yun Fat gives his character a moral fibre that is not especially unique to the hit-man's "code", though does venture further than the usual brand of perverse professionalism, to the extent that guilt erodes his self-confidence and ability to execute his assignments. Go-between and friend Chu Kong tries in vain to persuade him to remain loyal to the code, and the long standing partnership subsequently frays and re-galvanises out of sheer necessity as the pair (joined by the rogue detective) attempt to withstand some of the most fierce gun battles ever staged. Cleverly orchestrated plot enables a rich and vivid tale to emerge, expressed through characters who exude a strong sense of dignity but who struggle with the weight of guilt. Danny Lee is at times hilariously over-bearing, though how much of that is attributable to the banal dubbing is debatable. There's more than a little homosexual undertone present in the camaraderie between Yun Fat and his co-stars, and it's an element that exposes their human frailties, making the characters more accessible to the audience. The characters are smooth, sophisticated and eloquent and Woo's choreographed plot is highly stylised and intricate in visual detail, so much so that the gun battles look like classical ballets. Probably doesn't translate to most Western audiences, but it's a ground-breaker in its reach nonetheless and if you can withstand the occasionally corny dubbing (Dumbo and Mickey Mouse nicknames for example, which can be a comical distraction), then you should enjoy the experience.

    As an avid film buff and a guy who has seen over 4000 movies, I can only say that this illogical, ridiculously plotted, written, acted, shot and directed steamy piece of crap was one of the only movies that I watched out of curiosity and fast-forwarded from half to the stupid and bloody ending. The acting is soooooooooooooooooo abysmal and the central character who's supposed to be a super-macho dude is so gay that I thought I wish I had eaten 10 pounds of lard than watching this ludicrous garbage of a movie. Rather than an homage - which is what it's reputed to be - to Melville's Le Samoura&iuml;, it's an insult to that landmark masterpiece. Please avoid this at any price! Simply, One of the worst movies of my life.

    John Woo is a sensitive new age guy who is probably busting to make a period drama filled with romance, lush backdrops, glorious costumes and electrifying dialogue. It just so happens that his primary skill is choreographing hugely elaborate gunfights with insanely high bodycounts and much bloodletting. Such is the case with The Killer, the film opens with peaceful music, an opulent candelit backdrop  replete with the requisite white doves  and a handsome guy giving a friendly smile at the nice lady in the club who is singing beautifully for the appreciative patrons. Then with a start action-Woo takes over, perhaps realising that a mortgage payment is due and that doves, smiles and pan-pipes don't pay the bills. The smiling guy is Jeff (Chow Yun Fat), a contract assassin in the club on business. He sets about his tasks and 73 spurting squib-assisted deaths later he can knock off for the day Unfortunately in the hail of bullets and cacophony of death cries and splintering shrapnel Jeff managed to inadvertently blind the nice singing lady named Jenny with the powder blast from one of his many death dealing shots. Being the nice guy that he is he takes pity on Jenny and in the weeks that follow her release from hospital spends much time helping her readjust to her new sightless existence, and of course the two gradually fall in love  with Jenny never realising that her beau is in fact the very man who rendered her likely to fall over her own furniture As with every John Woo film the hero needs a counterpart, because without one there can be no Mexican standoff later in the film  and yes this film has more than one  the foil to Chow's killer is Inspector Lee, though they end up calling each other Mickey Mouse and Dumbo in much of the lamentable dialogue that permeates the 'waiting time' between shoot outs. Jeff and Lee see similarities in each other despite standing on opposite sides of the law, another staple of Woo films, the bad guys aren't really that bad and the cops always seem to readily sympathise and even befriend them. But that said both men shoot often, shoot straight, and things (and people) tend to explode and be propelled upwards when they shoot them. And they each have numerous chances to shoot at things in glorious intricately designed lengthy sequences of carnage and explosions. (I had a joke about China needing a one-child policy because Chow Yun Fat killed all of the males in John Woo films, but even I dubbed it borderline racist.) I can't say that Jeff takes out hundreds of armed assailants single-handedly in this film, because even though he does take out that many he often utilises both hands, each gripping the pistol tightly as he flies all over the place taking out thugs and punks. The plot is merely a frame to hang some of the best shootouts in cinema history on, and the undeniable truth is that some of the non-shooty scenes are frankly pretty amateurish. But this is an action film, and when scrutinised as an action film is stands head and shoulders above many modern day pretenders. Jeff and Lee ultimately end up in a breathtaking showdown vs a never-ending horde of blindly (no pun intended) charging assailants who storm their church hideout about 6 at a time Left 4 Dead style. As they repel these invaders in stylish fashion they share an ongoing dialogue about how much they mean to each other and such, pausing only to grit their teeth and pick off still more would-be assassins. Even in near death situations John Woo still wants people to share their feelings... There is an ongoing argument over whether this and its companion piece Hard Boiled are truly classics or simply well choreographed bullet-operas. I'll just say that where action is concerned no-one stages a bloody shootout as well as Woo. I'd much rather watch this or Hard Boiled than any of the last 17 generic action flicks churned out by Hollywood. If I had to choose, I would rate the hospital shootout in Hard Boiled as better than anything in The Killer, but the church finale here does take a lot of beating also. Ultimately though you can't really go wrong with either. Final Rating  8.5 / 10. John Woo films are like the contestants for Miss Universe pageants  breathtaking to look at, but it's always slightly disappointing when they talk

    John Woo (HARD BOILED, FACE/OFF) directs Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man with a code of honor who agrees to do one last job before retirement. However, he soon becomes double-crossed by his Triad employers after trying to protect a songstress (Sally Yeh). Teaming with an undercover cop (Danny Lee), the two leads get themselves involved in one of the most exciting showdowns in action cinema. What can I say? Woo is a filmmaker who knows how to balance the action scenes and the emotional moments within the operatic grand scale of THE KILLER. Chow Yun-Fat delivers his charismatic performance with the combination of Eastwood's THE MAN WITH NO NAME, Jean Reno's quiet, lone hit man in LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL and Steve McQueen's untouchable COOLER KING in THE GREAT ESCAPE. THE KILLER is an operatic, unforgettable and mind-blowing masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema.

    Many people that view this movie today will probably think of it as cheesy and overrated, especially now with all the slick CGI action films out left and right. At the time that the film came out, it was pretty revolutionary. It put John Woo on the map for his cinematic style that would influence many films to come and to this date, it's clear his influence hasn't left. In my opinion, this movie is a classic in the action genre. John Woo made A Better Tomorrow Parts 1 & 2 prior to The Killer, and they were definitely good, but The Killer reached perfection when compared. His slick camera moves and seamless action were polished. When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film. That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old. To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it. Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED. As for his Hollywood films, I really don't consider them in the same league as his original films. What happened to the days when there were actual stunts and real explosions???

    I'm a 21 year old male. My father had a DVD of this on the shelf, and having never heard of it, I looked it up on IMDb... 7.9 eh? I'll give it a try. Being from 1989, I didn't expect much, but nothing this bad. The audio is atrocious. Guns sound fake, the punch noises are terrible, bad guys are apparently blind, and virtually none of the characters decisions make sense. The only reason I recommend watching this is to appreciate how far modern cinema has come (or how crappy foreign cinema was). Maybe if you're older than I am, it's fun to reminisce about when you saw this movie ages ago, but this is complete trash compared to any decent action film of the past 15 years. 1 star for 2013. Please, learn from my mistake and don't waste your time.

    A hit-man (Yun Fat) blinds a young woman during a violent assassination in a piano bar, and remorseful of his actions, seeks to atone for his crime by helping her to regain her sight. During the process he discovers he's no longer cut-out for his line of work, but before he can retire to the country, he must out-manoeuvre a relentless rogue detective (Lee) and contest the double-crossing mobster hell-bent on establishing his dominance. Yun Fat gives his character a moral fibre that is not especially unique to the hit-man's "code", though does venture further than the usual brand of perverse professionalism, to the extent that guilt erodes his self-confidence and ability to execute his assignments. Go-between and friend Chu Kong tries in vain to persuade him to remain loyal to the code, and the long standing partnership subsequently frays and re-galvanises out of sheer necessity as the pair (joined by the rogue detective) attempt to withstand some of the most fierce gun battles ever staged. Cleverly orchestrated plot enables a rich and vivid tale to emerge, expressed through characters who exude a strong sense of dignity but who struggle with the weight of guilt. Danny Lee is at times hilariously over-bearing, though how much of that is attributable to the banal dubbing is debatable. There's more than a little homosexual undertone present in the camaraderie between Yun Fat and his co-stars, and it's an element that exposes their human frailties, making the characters more accessible to the audience. The characters are smooth, sophisticated and eloquent and Woo's choreographed plot is highly stylised and intricate in visual detail, so much so that the gun battles look like classical ballets. Probably doesn't translate to most Western audiences, but it's a ground-breaker in its reach nonetheless and if you can withstand the occasionally corny dubbing (Dumbo and Mickey Mouse nicknames for example, which can be a comical distraction), then you should enjoy the experience.

    As an avid film buff and a guy who has seen over 4000 movies, I can only say that this illogical, ridiculously plotted, written, acted, shot and directed steamy piece of crap was one of the only movies that I watched out of curiosity and fast-forwarded from half to the stupid and bloody ending. The acting is soooooooooooooooooo abysmal and the central character who's supposed to be a super-macho dude is so gay that I thought I wish I had eaten 10 pounds of lard than watching this ludicrous garbage of a movie. Rather than an homage - which is what it's reputed to be - to Melville's Le Samoura&iuml;, it's an insult to that landmark masterpiece. Please avoid this at any price! Simply, One of the worst movies of my life.

    John Woo is a sensitive new age guy who is probably busting to make a period drama filled with romance, lush backdrops, glorious costumes and electrifying dialogue. It just so happens that his primary skill is choreographing hugely elaborate gunfights with insanely high bodycounts and much bloodletting. Such is the case with The Killer, the film opens with peaceful music, an opulent candelit backdrop  replete with the requisite white doves  and a handsome guy giving a friendly smile at the nice lady in the club who is singing beautifully for the appreciative patrons. Then with a start action-Woo takes over, perhaps realising that a mortgage payment is due and that doves, smiles and pan-pipes don't pay the bills. The smiling guy is Jeff (Chow Yun Fat), a contract assassin in the club on business. He sets about his tasks and 73 spurting squib-assisted deaths later he can knock off for the day Unfortunately in the hail of bullets and cacophony of death cries and splintering shrapnel Jeff managed to inadvertently blind the nice singing lady named Jenny with the powder blast from one of his many death dealing shots. Being the nice guy that he is he takes pity on Jenny and in the weeks that follow her release from hospital spends much time helping her readjust to her new sightless existence, and of course the two gradually fall in love  with Jenny never realising that her beau is in fact the very man who rendered her likely to fall over her own furniture As with every John Woo film the hero needs a counterpart, because without one there can be no Mexican standoff later in the film  and yes this film has more than one  the foil to Chow's killer is Inspector Lee, though they end up calling each other Mickey Mouse and Dumbo in much of the lamentable dialogue that permeates the 'waiting time' between shoot outs. Jeff and Lee see similarities in each other despite standing on opposite sides of the law, another staple of Woo films, the bad guys aren't really that bad and the cops always seem to readily sympathise and even befriend them. But that said both men shoot often, shoot straight, and things (and people) tend to explode and be propelled upwards when they shoot them. And they each have numerous chances to shoot at things in glorious intricately designed lengthy sequences of carnage and explosions. (I had a joke about China needing a one-child policy because Chow Yun Fat killed all of the males in John Woo films, but even I dubbed it borderline racist.) I can't say that Jeff takes out hundreds of armed assailants single-handedly in this film, because even though he does take out that many he often utilises both hands, each gripping the pistol tightly as he flies all over the place taking out thugs and punks. The plot is merely a frame to hang some of the best shootouts in cinema history on, and the undeniable truth is that some of the non-shooty scenes are frankly pretty amateurish. But this is an action film, and when scrutinised as an action film is stands head and shoulders above many modern day pretenders. Jeff and Lee ultimately end up in a breathtaking showdown vs a never-ending horde of blindly (no pun intended) charging assailants who storm their church hideout about 6 at a time Left 4 Dead style. As they repel these invaders in stylish fashion they share an ongoing dialogue about how much they mean to each other and such, pausing only to grit their teeth and pick off still more would-be assassins. Even in near death situations John Woo still wants people to share their feelings... There is an ongoing argument over whether this and its companion piece Hard Boiled are truly classics or simply well choreographed bullet-operas. I'll just say that where action is concerned no-one stages a bloody shootout as well as Woo. I'd much rather watch this or Hard Boiled than any of the last 17 generic action flicks churned out by Hollywood. If I had to choose, I would rate the hospital shootout in Hard Boiled as better than anything in The Killer, but the church finale here does take a lot of beating also. Ultimately though you can't really go wrong with either. Final Rating  8.5 / 10. John Woo films are like the contestants for Miss Universe pageants  breathtaking to look at, but it's always slightly disappointing when they talk

    John Woo (HARD BOILED, FACE/OFF) directs Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man with a code of honor who agrees to do one last job before retirement. However, he soon becomes double-crossed by his Triad employers after trying to protect a songstress (Sally Yeh). Teaming with an undercover cop (Danny Lee), the two leads get themselves involved in one of the most exciting showdowns in action cinema. What can I say? Woo is a filmmaker who knows how to balance the action scenes and the emotional moments within the operatic grand scale of THE KILLER. Chow Yun-Fat delivers his charismatic performance with the combination of Eastwood's THE MAN WITH NO NAME, Jean Reno's quiet, lone hit man in LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL and Steve McQueen's untouchable COOLER KING in THE GREAT ESCAPE. THE KILLER is an operatic, unforgettable and mind-blowing masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema.

    The Killer is one of the few action movies in the 80's that not only had spectacular action but also a lot of heart, soul, and emotion. It's also one of if not the most influential action films of all time, up there with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and The Terminator. But why is that, let's find out! First of all, The Killer is extremely stylized. It's action sequences aren't just typical Hollywood shootouts with explosions, machine guns, and one-liners. There's a lot of visual poetry going on here with white doves flying around and a lot of slow-motion being used. The action isn't the only thing that's stylized about this film, it's drama is also very stylized. John Woo's movies have a recurring theme of men bonding and becoming like brothers and it's very present here. In Hollywood, this might not happen because it's " too gay " but Woo seems to love men bonding becoming like brothers so all of the friendships in his films feel very genuine and real. The dramatic scenes in this film can come off melodramatic to some people but I think it's very powerful because of how believable their relationships are. Secondly, it actually has a good, dramatic story with complex characters and genuine emotions. Face it, most action movies are just simple escapist entertainment with a nice happy ending to put a smile on your face at the end. But The Killer is a little different. While it has all the action you want in an action movie, the script focuses more on developing our protagonist, Jeffrey(Chow-yun Fat) who is an assassin who accidentally blinds a singer with a muzzle flash in his gun during one of his assassination missions so he accepts one last job, hoping to use the money to help her recover her eyesight but he ends up getting betrayed by his Triad boss who now wants him dead. What's fascinating about his character is that he doesn't seem to be a bad man who just wants a new path but he seems to be a man with a good heart but made some bad choices due to his own questionable morality. He said to Jenny(the girl he blinded) he once thought that they deserved it but now he thinks differently. Perhaps he started his career not because of money but because he thinks he's doing something right but throughout this film, he learns that violence brings nothing but bloodshed. Almost every shootout in this film, something goes wrong for him. And by the end of the movie, he says he can't do this anymore and it's making him sick. In contrast, we have the cop learning an opposite lesson, that of you can't always follow the rules to solve things in the world. He starts out on a quest to take down Jeffrey but he slowly learns that he isn't just another assassin who kills for money but also a man with heart. So he breaks the rules by helping him on his mission to protect and recover Jenny's eyesight. The message of this movie is that ultimately the world isn't black and white and it's impressive how well- written this film is considering Woo was writing it as he was going along. Lastly, this movie is very brave with its ending. Most Hollywood flicks wouldn't go with this ending but since the Hong Kong film industry is more accepting of unhappy endings, this is what happens at the end. After a massive shootout in the church, Jeffrey gets shot and killed by the Triad boss but the cop ends up avenging Jeffrey even though the man surrendered thus getting arrested. This ending left me a little sad after watching this movie but I think the point of this ending was that Jeffrey ultimately realizes his sins too late and thus gets punished in the worst way possible in the end. The cop makes the sacrifice he does because he realizes that him getting arrested wasn't good enough and sometimes you gotta break the rules to make the world a better place. The Killer is stylish, exciting, thoughtful, intelligent, and wonderfully well-nuanced and because of that, I am gonna give it a 9/10.

    The Killer is perhaps the most melodramatic of John Woo's blood operas, but there's an inexplicable charm to his work that never lets it come off as manipulative or cloying. Partly because Woo seems to be an incredibly thoughtful, merciful man who gives his scripts a great deal of poetic irony, and partly because it's very obviously a modern take on an entire culture of chivalry & swordplay stories; unlike most sentimentalism, it's not empty. There's a bit of a camp appeal to Chow Yun-Fat mowing down 50 guys in a clip considering the movie's all about mercy and Christian pacifism, but it's so sincere and lovable. Woo branches out a little here and in effect sorta comes in to his own. There's a gaudy French new wave vibe to the visuals that perfectly matches the unrealistic, Romantic heights of the drama, and the violence takes the "sliiiiightly over-the-top" action of A Better Tomorrow to such an absurdly ballistic extent that it looks more like some fireworks+martial arts combination than gunplay. Yet, stuff like The Matrix remains a bad caricature of this movie; there's still a grit and old-fashioned physicality to Woo's action you don't see in Hollywood. Performances are perfectly broad. There's one notable exchange with no dialogue, just facial expressions, and although the actors do mug the camera a bit, it's perfect--they're screaming at each other without words. The pyrotechnics of the gun battles are obviously glamourized, yet Woo does his best to give it all a certain moral weight. It's an interesting juxtaposition; when the protagonist flips a guy over a counter and stabs him right in the spine with a butcher knife, it seems so much worse than the guys catching bullets in their skulls by the truckload, and that says volumes about the movie's intentions as well as our own expectations when it comes to this kind of violence. There's a kind of inevitable hypocrisy to such an uneasy negotiation between excessive pulp and romantic chivalry, but nothing feels cheap.

    An Asian Superstar Director and Actor, John Woo and Chow Yun Fat, were burning up screens and thrilling Movie Goers before coming to America. Their reputations precede them. Their reception here was nothing less than phenomenal. Critics and Audiences wallowed in the over the top accentuation of Violence coated with maudlin Melodrama. As History would have it, American Movies were never the same. This unabashed Director was supremely influential and his Films, both Hong Kong and American have a distinct Style that cannot be dismissed or overlooked. He delivers Movies infused with adrenaline and patched with Pathos. They all have an unreal feel and thus are set apart from the Genre they inhabit. The Killer and some of his other Hong Kong Films are rough and raw Woo, lacking the Hollywood budgets but never lacking Entertainment Value or interest. This one could be considered his best Non-American Movie but that takes nothing away from the others. They are all stamped with a saturation of take-notice Expressionistic Art and all magnetically draw one into its World of exaggeration and excess. There is much to admire in this Film with its constant ping-pong of outrageous gun battles and deep emotional compassion. There is an over abundance of everything and that makes this a very different experience than the average Action/Crime Flick. John Woo applies his Artistic strokes with a powerful high compression air-brush and never uses a single-hair stroke. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is the appeal.

    The Killer was a classic crime drama about a hit-man named Ah Jong (played by Chow Yun Fat) who decides he's had enough and wants to leave the life of an assassin for good unfortunately during the hit something unexpected occurs. A young singer named Jenny (played by Sally Yeh) is there at the wrong place at the wrong time and Ah Jong accidentally injures her eyes. This prompts Ah Jong to hold off his retirement to take one more job to pay for Jenny's operation to get her vision back to normal. This was a classic crime/action drama and I thought there really was chemistry between Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh along with the great performances of many of the cast at least including Danny Lee who is on par with Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh with his performance of Inspector Li Ying of the Hong Kong Police!

If I had to choose, I would rate the hospital shootout in Hard Boiled as better than anything in The Killer, but the church finale here does take a lot of beating also. Ultimately though you can't really go wrong with either. Final Rating  8.5 / 10. John Woo films are like the contestants for Miss Universe pageants  breathtaking to look at, but it's always slightly disappointing when they talk

    John Woo (HARD BOILED, FACE/OFF) directs Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man with a code of honor who agrees to do one last job before retirement. However, he soon becomes double-crossed by his Triad employers after trying to protect a songstress (Sally Yeh). Teaming with an undercover cop (Danny Lee), the two leads get themselves involved in one of the most exciting showdowns in action cinema. What can I say? Woo is a filmmaker who knows how to balance the action scenes and the emotional moments within the operatic grand scale of THE KILLER. Chow Yun-Fat delivers his charismatic performance with the combination of Eastwood's THE MAN WITH NO NAME, Jean Reno's quiet, lone hit man in LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL and Steve McQueen's untouchable COOLER KING in THE GREAT ESCAPE. THE KILLER is an operatic, unforgettable and mind-blowing masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema.

    The Killer is one of the few action movies in the 80's that not only had spectacular action but also a lot of heart, soul, and emotion. It's also one of if not the most influential action films of all time, up there with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and The Terminator. But why is that, let's find out! First of all, The Killer is extremely stylized. It's action sequences aren't just typical Hollywood shootouts with explosions, machine guns, and one-liners. There's a lot of visual poetry going on here with white doves flying around and a lot of slow-motion being used. The action isn't the only thing that's stylized about this film, it's drama is also very stylized. John Woo's movies have a recurring theme of men bonding and becoming like brothers and it's very present here. In Hollywood, this might not happen because it's " too gay " but Woo seems to love men bonding becoming like brothers so all of the friendships in his films feel very genuine and real. The dramatic scenes in this film can come off melodramatic to some people but I think it's very powerful because of how believable their relationships are. Secondly, it actually has a good, dramatic story with complex characters and genuine emotions. Face it, most action movies are just simple escapist entertainment with a nice happy ending to put a smile on your face at the end. But The Killer is a little different. While it has all the action you want in an action movie, the script focuses more on developing our protagonist, Jeffrey(Chow-yun Fat) who is an assassin who accidentally blinds a singer with a muzzle flash in his gun during one of his assassination missions so he accepts one last job, hoping to use the money to help her recover her eyesight but he ends up getting betrayed by his Triad boss who now wants him dead. What's fascinating about his character is that he doesn't seem to be a bad man who just wants a new path but he seems to be a man with a good heart but made some bad choices due to his own questionable morality. He said to Jenny(the girl he blinded) he once thought that they deserved it but now he thinks differently. Perhaps he started his career not because of money but because he thinks he's doing something right but throughout this film, he learns that violence brings nothing but bloodshed. Almost every shootout in this film, something goes wrong for him. And by the end of the movie, he says he can't do this anymore and it's making him sick. In contrast, we have the cop learning an opposite lesson, that of you can't always follow the rules to solve things in the world. He starts out on a quest to take down Jeffrey but he slowly learns that he isn't just another assassin who kills for money but also a man with heart. So he breaks the rules by helping him on his mission to protect and recover Jenny's eyesight. The message of this movie is that ultimately the world isn't black and white and it's impressive how well- written this film is considering Woo was writing it as he was going along. Lastly, this movie is very brave with its ending. Most Hollywood flicks wouldn't go with this ending but since the Hong Kong film industry is more accepting of unhappy endings, this is what happens at the end. After a massive shootout in the church, Jeffrey gets shot and killed by the Triad boss but the cop ends up avenging Jeffrey even though the man surrendered thus getting arrested. This ending left me a little sad after watching this movie but I think the point of this ending was that Jeffrey ultimately realizes his sins too late and thus gets punished in the worst way possible in the end. The cop makes the sacrifice he does because he realizes that him getting arrested wasn't good enough and sometimes you gotta break the rules to make the world a better place. The Killer is stylish, exciting, thoughtful, intelligent, and wonderfully well-nuanced and because of that, I am gonna give it a 9/10.

    The Killer is perhaps the most melodramatic of John Woo's blood operas, but there's an inexplicable charm to his work that never lets it come off as manipulative or cloying. Partly because Woo seems to be an incredibly thoughtful, merciful man who gives his scripts a great deal of poetic irony, and partly because it's very obviously a modern take on an entire culture of chivalry & swordplay stories; unlike most sentimentalism, it's not empty. There's a bit of a camp appeal to Chow Yun-Fat mowing down 50 guys in a clip considering the movie's all about mercy and Christian pacifism, but it's so sincere and lovable. Woo branches out a little here and in effect sorta comes in to his own. There's a gaudy French new wave vibe to the visuals that perfectly matches the unrealistic, Romantic heights of the drama, and the violence takes the "sliiiiightly over-the-top" action of A Better Tomorrow to such an absurdly ballistic extent that it looks more like some fireworks+martial arts combination than gunplay. Yet, stuff like The Matrix remains a bad caricature of this movie; there's still a grit and old-fashioned physicality to Woo's action you don't see in Hollywood. Performances are perfectly broad. There's one notable exchange with no dialogue, just facial expressions, and although the actors do mug the camera a bit, it's perfect--they're screaming at each other without words. The pyrotechnics of the gun battles are obviously glamourized, yet Woo does his best to give it all a certain moral weight. It's an interesting juxtaposition; when the protagonist flips a guy over a counter and stabs him right in the spine with a butcher knife, it seems so much worse than the guys catching bullets in their skulls by the truckload, and that says volumes about the movie's intentions as well as our own expectations when it comes to this kind of violence. There's a kind of inevitable hypocrisy to such an uneasy negotiation between excessive pulp and romantic chivalry, but nothing feels cheap.

    An Asian Superstar Director and Actor, John Woo and Chow Yun Fat, were burning up screens and thrilling Movie Goers before coming to America. Their reputations precede them. Their reception here was nothing less than phenomenal. Critics and Audiences wallowed in the over the top accentuation of Violence coated with maudlin Melodrama. As History would have it, American Movies were never the same. This unabashed Director was supremely influential and his Films, both Hong Kong and American have a distinct Style that cannot be dismissed or overlooked. He delivers Movies infused with adrenaline and patched with Pathos. They all have an unreal feel and thus are set apart from the Genre they inhabit. The Killer and some of his other Hong Kong Films are rough and raw Woo, lacking the Hollywood budgets but never lacking Entertainment Value or interest. This one could be considered his best Non-American Movie but that takes nothing away from the others. They are all stamped with a saturation of take-notice Expressionistic Art and all magnetically draw one into its World of exaggeration and excess. There is much to admire in this Film with its constant ping-pong of outrageous gun battles and deep emotional compassion. There is an over abundance of everything and that makes this a very different experience than the average Action/Crime Flick. John Woo applies his Artistic strokes with a powerful high compression air-brush and never uses a single-hair stroke. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is the appeal.

    The Killer was a classic crime drama about a hit-man named Ah Jong (played by Chow Yun Fat) who decides he's had enough and wants to leave the life of an assassin for good unfortunately during the hit something unexpected occurs. A young singer named Jenny (played by Sally Yeh) is there at the wrong place at the wrong time and Ah Jong accidentally injures her eyes. This prompts Ah Jong to hold off his retirement to take one more job to pay for Jenny's operation to get her vision back to normal. This was a classic crime/action drama and I thought there really was chemistry between Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh along with the great performances of many of the cast at least including Danny Lee who is on par with Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh with his performance of Inspector Li Ying of the Hong Kong Police!

    Many people that view this movie today will probably think of it as cheesy and overrated, especially now with all the slick CGI action films out left and right. At the time that the film came out, it was pretty revolutionary. It put John Woo on the map for his cinematic style that would influence many films to come and to this date, it's clear his influence hasn't left. In my opinion, this movie is a classic in the action genre. John Woo made A Better Tomorrow Parts 1 & 2 prior to The Killer, and they were definitely good, but The Killer reached perfection when compared. His slick camera moves and seamless action were polished. When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film. That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old. To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it. Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED. As for his Hollywood films, I really don't consider them in the same league as his original films. What happened to the days when there were actual stunts and real explosions???

    I'm a 21 year old male. My father had a DVD of this on the shelf, and having never heard of it, I looked it up on IMDb... 7.9 eh? I'll give it a try. Being from 1989, I didn't expect much, but nothing this bad. The audio is atrocious. Guns sound fake, the punch noises are terrible, bad guys are apparently blind, and virtually none of the characters decisions make sense. The only reason I recommend watching this is to appreciate how far modern cinema has come (or how crappy foreign cinema was). Maybe if you're older than I am, it's fun to reminisce about when you saw this movie ages ago, but this is complete trash compared to any decent action film of the past 15 years. 1 star for 2013. Please, learn from my mistake and don't waste your time.

    A hit-man (Yun Fat) blinds a young woman during a violent assassination in a piano bar, and remorseful of his actions, seeks to atone for his crime by helping her to regain her sight. During the process he discovers he's no longer cut-out for his line of work, but before he can retire to the country, he must out-manoeuvre a relentless rogue detective (Lee) and contest the double-crossing mobster hell-bent on establishing his dominance. Yun Fat gives his character a moral fibre that is not especially unique to the hit-man's "code", though does venture further than the usual brand of perverse professionalism, to the extent that guilt erodes his self-confidence and ability to execute his assignments. Go-between and friend Chu Kong tries in vain to persuade him to remain loyal to the code, and the long standing partnership subsequently frays and re-galvanises out of sheer necessity as the pair (joined by the rogue detective) attempt to withstand some of the most fierce gun battles ever staged. Cleverly orchestrated plot enables a rich and vivid tale to emerge, expressed through characters who exude a strong sense of dignity but who struggle with the weight of guilt. Danny Lee is at times hilariously over-bearing, though how much of that is attributable to the banal dubbing is debatable. There's more than a little homosexual undertone present in the camaraderie between Yun Fat and his co-stars, and it's an element that exposes their human frailties, making the characters more accessible to the audience. The characters are smooth, sophisticated and eloquent and Woo's choreographed plot is highly stylised and intricate in visual detail, so much so that the gun battles look like classical ballets. Probably doesn't translate to most Western audiences, but it's a ground-breaker in its reach nonetheless and if you can withstand the occasionally corny dubbing (Dumbo and Mickey Mouse nicknames for example, which can be a comical distraction), then you should enjoy the experience.

    As an avid film buff and a guy who has seen over 4000 movies, I can only say that this illogical, ridiculously plotted, written, acted, shot and directed steamy piece of crap was one of the only movies that I watched out of curiosity and fast-forwarded from half to the stupid and bloody ending. The acting is soooooooooooooooooo abysmal and the central character who's supposed to be a super-macho dude is so gay that I thought I wish I had eaten 10 pounds of lard than watching this ludicrous garbage of a movie. Rather than an homage - which is what it's reputed to be - to Melville's Le Samoura&iuml;, it's an insult to that landmark masterpiece. Please avoid this at any price! Simply, One of the worst movies of my life.

    John Woo is a sensitive new age guy who is probably busting to make a period drama filled with romance, lush backdrops, glorious costumes and electrifying dialogue. It just so happens that his primary skill is choreographing hugely elaborate gunfights with insanely high bodycounts and much bloodletting. Such is the case with The Killer, the film opens with peaceful music, an opulent candelit backdrop  replete with the requisite white doves  and a handsome guy giving a friendly smile at the nice lady in the club who is singing beautifully for the appreciative patrons. Then with a start action-Woo takes over, perhaps realising that a mortgage payment is due and that doves, smiles and pan-pipes don't pay the bills. The smiling guy is Jeff (Chow Yun Fat), a contract assassin in the club on business. He sets about his tasks and 73 spurting squib-assisted deaths later he can knock off for the day Unfortunately in the hail of bullets and cacophony of death cries and splintering shrapnel Jeff managed to inadvertently blind the nice singing lady named Jenny with the powder blast from one of his many death dealing shots. Being the nice guy that he is he takes pity on Jenny and in the weeks that follow her release from hospital spends much time helping her readjust to her new sightless existence, and of course the two gradually fall in love  with Jenny never realising that her beau is in fact the very man who rendered her likely to fall over her own furniture As with every John Woo film the hero needs a counterpart, because without one there can be no Mexican standoff later in the film  and yes this film has more than one  the foil to Chow's killer is Inspector Lee, though they end up calling each other Mickey Mouse and Dumbo in much of the lamentable dialogue that permeates the 'waiting time' between shoot outs. Jeff and Lee see similarities in each other despite standing on opposite sides of the law, another staple of Woo films, the bad guys aren't really that bad and the cops always seem to readily sympathise and even befriend them. But that said both men shoot often, shoot straight, and things (and people) tend to explode and be propelled upwards when they shoot them. And they each have numerous chances to shoot at things in glorious intricately designed lengthy sequences of carnage and explosions. (I had a joke about China needing a one-child policy because Chow Yun Fat killed all of the males in John Woo films, but even I dubbed it borderline racist.) I can't say that Jeff takes out hundreds of armed assailants single-handedly in this film, because even though he does take out that many he often utilises both hands, each gripping the pistol tightly as he flies all over the place taking out thugs and punks. The plot is merely a frame to hang some of the best shootouts in cinema history on, and the undeniable truth is that some of the non-shooty scenes are frankly pretty amateurish. But this is an action film, and when scrutinised as an action film is stands head and shoulders above many modern day pretenders. Jeff and Lee ultimately end up in a breathtaking showdown vs a never-ending horde of blindly (no pun intended) charging assailants who storm their church hideout about 6 at a time Left 4 Dead style. As they repel these invaders in stylish fashion they share an ongoing dialogue about how much they mean to each other and such, pausing only to grit their teeth and pick off still more would-be assassins. Even in near death situations John Woo still wants people to share their feelings... There is an ongoing argument over whether this and its companion piece Hard Boiled are truly classics or simply well choreographed bullet-operas. I'll just say that where action is concerned no-one stages a bloody shootout as well as Woo. I'd much rather watch this or Hard Boiled than any of the last 17 generic action flicks churned out by Hollywood. If I had to choose, I would rate the hospital shootout in Hard Boiled as better than anything in The Killer, but the church finale here does take a lot of beating also. Ultimately though you can't really go wrong with either. Final Rating  8.5 / 10. John Woo films are like the contestants for Miss Universe pageants  breathtaking to look at, but it's always slightly disappointing when they talk

    Many people that view this movie today will probably think of it as cheesy and overrated, especially now with all the slick CGI action films out left and right. At the time that the film came out, it was pretty revolutionary. It put John Woo on the map for his cinematic style that would influence many films to come and to this date, it's clear his influence hasn't left. In my opinion, this movie is a classic in the action genre. John Woo made A Better Tomorrow Parts 1 & 2 prior to The Killer, and they were definitely good, but The Killer reached perfection when compared. His slick camera moves and seamless action were polished. When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film. That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old. To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it. Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED. As for his Hollywood films, I really don't consider them in the same league as his original films. What happened to the days when there were actual stunts and real explosions???

    I'm a 21 year old male. My father had a DVD of this on the shelf, and having never heard of it, I looked it up on IMDb... 7.9 eh? I'll give it a try. Being from 1989, I didn't expect much, but nothing this bad. The audio is atrocious. Guns sound fake, the punch noises are terrible, bad guys are apparently blind, and virtually none of the characters decisions make sense. The only reason I recommend watching this is to appreciate how far modern cinema has come (or how crappy foreign cinema was). Maybe if you're older than I am, it's fun to reminisce about when you saw this movie ages ago, but this is complete trash compared to any decent action film of the past 15 years. 1 star for 2013. Please, learn from my mistake and don't waste your time.

    A hit-man (Yun Fat) blinds a young woman during a violent assassination in a piano bar, and remorseful of his actions, seeks to atone for his crime by helping her to regain her sight. During the process he discovers he's no longer cut-out for his line of work, but before he can retire to the country, he must out-manoeuvre a relentless rogue detective (Lee) and contest the double-crossing mobster hell-bent on establishing his dominance. Yun Fat gives his character a moral fibre that is not especially unique to the hit-man's "code", though does venture further than the usual brand of perverse professionalism, to the extent that guilt erodes his self-confidence and ability to execute his assignments. Go-between and friend Chu Kong tries in vain to persuade him to remain loyal to the code, and the long standing partnership subsequently frays and re-galvanises out of sheer necessity as the pair (joined by the rogue detective) attempt to withstand some of the most fierce gun battles ever staged. Cleverly orchestrated plot enables a rich and vivid tale to emerge, expressed through characters who exude a strong sense of dignity but who struggle with the weight of guilt. Danny Lee is at times hilariously over-bearing, though how much of that is attributable to the banal dubbing is debatable. There's more than a little homosexual undertone present in the camaraderie between Yun Fat and his co-stars, and it's an element that exposes their human frailties, making the characters more accessible to the audience. The characters are smooth, sophisticated and eloquent and Woo's choreographed plot is highly stylised and intricate in visual detail, so much so that the gun battles look like classical ballets. Probably doesn't translate to most Western audiences, but it's a ground-breaker in its reach nonetheless and if you can withstand the occasionally corny dubbing (Dumbo and Mickey Mouse nicknames for example, which can be a comical distraction), then you should enjoy the experience.

    As an avid film buff and a guy who has seen over 4000 movies, I can only say that this illogical, ridiculously plotted, written, acted, shot and directed steamy piece of crap was one of the only movies that I watched out of curiosity and fast-forwarded from half to the stupid and bloody ending. The acting is soooooooooooooooooo abysmal and the central character who's supposed to be a super-macho dude is so gay that I thought I wish I had eaten 10 pounds of lard than watching this ludicrous garbage of a movie. Rather than an homage - which is what it's reputed to be - to Melville's Le Samoura&iuml;, it's an insult to that landmark masterpiece. Please avoid this at any price! Simply, One of the worst movies of my life.

    John Woo is a sensitive new age guy who is probably busting to make a period drama filled with romance, lush backdrops, glorious costumes and electrifying dialogue. It just so happens that his primary skill is choreographing hugely elaborate gunfights with insanely high bodycounts and much bloodletting. Such is the case with The Killer, the film opens with peaceful music, an opulent candelit backdrop  replete with the requisite white doves  and a handsome guy giving a friendly smile at the nice lady in the club who is singing beautifully for the appreciative patrons. Then with a start action-Woo takes over, perhaps realising that a mortgage payment is due and that doves, smiles and pan-pipes don't pay the bills. The smiling guy is Jeff (Chow Yun Fat), a contract assassin in the club on business. He sets about his tasks and 73 spurting squib-assisted deaths later he can knock off for the day Unfortunately in the hail of bullets and cacophony of death cries and splintering shrapnel Jeff managed to inadvertently blind the nice singing lady named Jenny with the powder blast from one of his many death dealing shots. Being the nice guy that he is he takes pity on Jenny and in the weeks that follow her release from hospital spends much time helping her readjust to her new sightless existence, and of course the two gradually fall in love  with Jenny never realising that her beau is in fact the very man who rendered her likely to fall over her own furniture As with every John Woo film the hero needs a counterpart, because without one there can be no Mexican standoff later in the film  and yes this film has more than one  the foil to Chow's killer is Inspector Lee, though they end up calling each other Mickey Mouse and Dumbo in much of the lamentable dialogue that permeates the 'waiting time' between shoot outs. Jeff and Lee see similarities in each other despite standing on opposite sides of the law, another staple of Woo films, the bad guys aren't really that bad and the cops always seem to readily sympathise and even befriend them. But that said both men shoot often, shoot straight, and things (and people) tend to explode and be propelled upwards when they shoot them. And they each have numerous chances to shoot at things in glorious intricately designed lengthy sequences of carnage and explosions. (I had a joke about China needing a one-child policy because Chow Yun Fat killed all of the males in John Woo films, but even I dubbed it borderline racist.) I can't say that Jeff takes out hundreds of armed assailants single-handedly in this film, because even though he does take out that many he often utilises both hands, each gripping the pistol tightly as he flies all over the place taking out thugs and punks. The plot is merely a frame to hang some of the best shootouts in cinema history on, and the undeniable truth is that some of the non-shooty scenes are frankly pretty amateurish. But this is an action film, and when scrutinised as an action film is stands head and shoulders above many modern day pretenders. Jeff and Lee ultimately end up in a breathtaking showdown vs a never-ending horde of blindly (no pun intended) charging assailants who storm their church hideout about 6 at a time Left 4 Dead style. As they repel these invaders in stylish fashion they share an ongoing dialogue about how much they mean to each other and such, pausing only to grit their teeth and pick off still more would-be assassins. Even in near death situations John Woo still wants people to share their feelings... There is an ongoing argument over whether this and its companion piece Hard Boiled are truly classics or simply well choreographed bullet-operas. I'll just say that where action is concerned no-one stages a bloody shootout as well as Woo. I'd much rather watch this or Hard Boiled than any of the last 17 generic action flicks churned out by Hollywood. If I had to choose, I would rate the hospital shootout in Hard Boiled as better than anything in The Killer, but the church finale here does take a lot of beating also. Ultimately though you can't really go wrong with either. Final Rating  8.5 / 10. John Woo films are like the contestants for Miss Universe pageants  breathtaking to look at, but it's always slightly disappointing when they talk

    John Woo (HARD BOILED, FACE/OFF) directs Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man with a code of honor who agrees to do one last job before retirement. However, he soon becomes double-crossed by his Triad employers after trying to protect a songstress (Sally Yeh). Teaming with an undercover cop (Danny Lee), the two leads get themselves involved in one of the most exciting showdowns in action cinema. What can I say? Woo is a filmmaker who knows how to balance the action scenes and the emotional moments within the operatic grand scale of THE KILLER. Chow Yun-Fat delivers his charismatic performance with the combination of Eastwood's THE MAN WITH NO NAME, Jean Reno's quiet, lone hit man in LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL and Steve McQueen's untouchable COOLER KING in THE GREAT ESCAPE. THE KILLER is an operatic, unforgettable and mind-blowing masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema.

    The Killer is one of the few action movies in the 80's that not only had spectacular action but also a lot of heart, soul, and emotion. It's also one of if not the most influential action films of all time, up there with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and The Terminator. But why is that, let's find out! First of all, The Killer is extremely stylized. It's action sequences aren't just typical Hollywood shootouts with explosions, machine guns, and one-liners. There's a lot of visual poetry going on here with white doves flying around and a lot of slow-motion being used. The action isn't the only thing that's stylized about this film, it's drama is also very stylized. John Woo's movies have a recurring theme of men bonding and becoming like brothers and it's very present here. In Hollywood, this might not happen because it's " too gay " but Woo seems to love men bonding becoming like brothers so all of the friendships in his films feel very genuine and real. The dramatic scenes in this film can come off melodramatic to some people but I think it's very powerful because of how believable their relationships are. Secondly, it actually has a good, dramatic story with complex characters and genuine emotions. Face it, most action movies are just simple escapist entertainment with a nice happy ending to put a smile on your face at the end. But The Killer is a little different. While it has all the action you want in an action movie, the script focuses more on developing our protagonist, Jeffrey(Chow-yun Fat) who is an assassin who accidentally blinds a singer with a muzzle flash in his gun during one of his assassination missions so he accepts one last job, hoping to use the money to help her recover her eyesight but he ends up getting betrayed by his Triad boss who now wants him dead. What's fascinating about his character is that he doesn't seem to be a bad man who just wants a new path but he seems to be a man with a good heart but made some bad choices due to his own questionable morality. He said to Jenny(the girl he blinded) he once thought that they deserved it but now he thinks differently. Perhaps he started his career not because of money but because he thinks he's doing something right but throughout this film, he learns that violence brings nothing but bloodshed. Almost every shootout in this film, something goes wrong for him. And by the end of the movie, he says he can't do this anymore and it's making him sick. In contrast, we have the cop learning an opposite lesson, that of you can't always follow the rules to solve things in the world. He starts out on a quest to take down Jeffrey but he slowly learns that he isn't just another assassin who kills for money but also a man with heart. So he breaks the rules by helping him on his mission to protect and recover Jenny's eyesight. The message of this movie is that ultimately the world isn't black and white and it's impressive how well- written this film is considering Woo was writing it as he was going along. Lastly, this movie is very brave with its ending. Most Hollywood flicks wouldn't go with this ending but since the Hong Kong film industry is more accepting of unhappy endings, this is what happens at the end. After a massive shootout in the church, Jeffrey gets shot and killed by the Triad boss but the cop ends up avenging Jeffrey even though the man surrendered thus getting arrested. This ending left me a little sad after watching this movie but I think the point of this ending was that Jeffrey ultimately realizes his sins too late and thus gets punished in the worst way possible in the end. The cop makes the sacrifice he does because he realizes that him getting arrested wasn't good enough and sometimes you gotta break the rules to make the world a better place. The Killer is stylish, exciting, thoughtful, intelligent, and wonderfully well-nuanced and because of that, I am gonna give it a 9/10.

    The Killer is perhaps the most melodramatic of John Woo's blood operas, but there's an inexplicable charm to his work that never lets it come off as manipulative or cloying. Partly because Woo seems to be an incredibly thoughtful, merciful man who gives his scripts a great deal of poetic irony, and partly because it's very obviously a modern take on an entire culture of chivalry & swordplay stories; unlike most sentimentalism, it's not empty. There's a bit of a camp appeal to Chow Yun-Fat mowing down 50 guys in a clip considering the movie's all about mercy and Christian pacifism, but it's so sincere and lovable. Woo branches out a little here and in effect sorta comes in to his own. There's a gaudy French new wave vibe to the visuals that perfectly matches the unrealistic, Romantic heights of the drama, and the violence takes the "sliiiiightly over-the-top" action of A Better Tomorrow to such an absurdly ballistic extent that it looks more like some fireworks+martial arts combination than gunplay. Yet, stuff like The Matrix remains a bad caricature of this movie; there's still a grit and old-fashioned physicality to Woo's action you don't see in Hollywood. Performances are perfectly broad. There's one notable exchange with no dialogue, just facial expressions, and although the actors do mug the camera a bit, it's perfect--they're screaming at each other without words. The pyrotechnics of the gun battles are obviously glamourized, yet Woo does his best to give it all a certain moral weight. It's an interesting juxtaposition; when the protagonist flips a guy over a counter and stabs him right in the spine with a butcher knife, it seems so much worse than the guys catching bullets in their skulls by the truckload, and that says volumes about the movie's intentions as well as our own expectations when it comes to this kind of violence. There's a kind of inevitable hypocrisy to such an uneasy negotiation between excessive pulp and romantic chivalry, but nothing feels cheap.

    An Asian Superstar Director and Actor, John Woo and Chow Yun Fat, were burning up screens and thrilling Movie Goers before coming to America. Their reputations precede them. Their reception here was nothing less than phenomenal. Critics and Audiences wallowed in the over the top accentuation of Violence coated with maudlin Melodrama. As History would have it, American Movies were never the same. This unabashed Director was supremely influential and his Films, both Hong Kong and American have a distinct Style that cannot be dismissed or overlooked. He delivers Movies infused with adrenaline and patched with Pathos. They all have an unreal feel and thus are set apart from the Genre they inhabit. The Killer and some of his other Hong Kong Films are rough and raw Woo, lacking the Hollywood budgets but never lacking Entertainment Value or interest. This one could be considered his best Non-American Movie but that takes nothing away from the others. They are all stamped with a saturation of take-notice Expressionistic Art and all magnetically draw one into its World of exaggeration and excess. There is much to admire in this Film with its constant ping-pong of outrageous gun battles and deep emotional compassion. There is an over abundance of everything and that makes this a very different experience than the average Action/Crime Flick. John Woo applies his Artistic strokes with a powerful high compression air-brush and never uses a single-hair stroke. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is the appeal.

    The Killer was a classic crime drama about a hit-man named Ah Jong (played by Chow Yun Fat) who decides he's had enough and wants to leave the life of an assassin for good unfortunately during the hit something unexpected occurs. A young singer named Jenny (played by Sally Yeh) is there at the wrong place at the wrong time and Ah Jong accidentally injures her eyes. This prompts Ah Jong to hold off his retirement to take one more job to pay for Jenny's operation to get her vision back to normal. This was a classic crime/action drama and I thought there really was chemistry between Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh along with the great performances of many of the cast at least including Danny Lee who is on par with Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh with his performance of Inspector Li Ying of the Hong Kong Police!

    John Woo (HARD BOILED, FACE/OFF) directs Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man with a code of honor who agrees to do one last job before retirement. However, he soon becomes double-crossed by his Triad employers after trying to protect a songstress (Sally Yeh). Teaming with an undercover cop (Danny Lee), the two leads get themselves involved in one of the most exciting showdowns in action cinema. What can I say? Woo is a filmmaker who knows how to balance the action scenes and the emotional moments within the operatic grand scale of THE KILLER. Chow Yun-Fat delivers his charismatic performance with the combination of Eastwood's THE MAN WITH NO NAME, Jean Reno's quiet, lone hit man in LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL and Steve McQueen's untouchable COOLER KING in THE GREAT ESCAPE. THE KILLER is an operatic, unforgettable and mind-blowing masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema.

    The Killer is one of the few action movies in the 80's that not only had spectacular action but also a lot of heart, soul, and emotion. It's also one of if not the most influential action films of all time, up there with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and The Terminator. But why is that, let's find out! First of all, The Killer is extremely stylized. It's action sequences aren't just typical Hollywood shootouts with explosions, machine guns, and one-liners. There's a lot of visual poetry going on here with white doves flying around and a lot of slow-motion being used. The action isn't the only thing that's stylized about this film, it's drama is also very stylized. John Woo's movies have a recurring theme of men bonding and becoming like brothers and it's very present here. In Hollywood, this might not happen because it's " too gay " but Woo seems to love men bonding becoming like brothers so all of the friendships in his films feel very genuine and real. The dramatic scenes in this film can come off melodramatic to some people but I think it's very powerful because of how believable their relationships are. Secondly, it actually has a good, dramatic story with complex characters and genuine emotions. Face it, most action movies are just simple escapist entertainment with a nice happy ending to put a smile on your face at the end. But The Killer is a little different. While it has all the action you want in an action movie, the script focuses more on developing our protagonist, Jeffrey(Chow-yun Fat) who is an assassin who accidentally blinds a singer with a muzzle flash in his gun during one of his assassination missions so he accepts one last job, hoping to use the money to help her recover her eyesight but he ends up getting betrayed by his Triad boss who now wants him dead. What's fascinating about his character is that he doesn't seem to be a bad man who just wants a new path but he seems to be a man with a good heart but made some bad choices due to his own questionable morality. He said to Jenny(the girl he blinded) he once thought that they deserved it but now he thinks differently. Perhaps he started his career not because of money but because he thinks he's doing something right but throughout this film, he learns that violence brings nothing but bloodshed. Almost every shootout in this film, something goes wrong for him. And by the end of the movie, he says he can't do this anymore and it's making him sick. In contrast, we have the cop learning an opposite lesson, that of you can't always follow the rules to solve things in the world. He starts out on a quest to take down Jeffrey but he slowly learns that he isn't just another assassin who kills for money but also a man with heart. So he breaks the rules by helping him on his mission to protect and recover Jenny's eyesight. The message of this movie is that ultimately the world isn't black and white and it's impressive how well- written this film is considering Woo was writing it as he was going along. Lastly, this movie is very brave with its ending. Most Hollywood flicks wouldn't go with this ending but since the Hong Kong film industry is more accepting of unhappy endings, this is what happens at the end. After a massive shootout in the church, Jeffrey gets shot and killed by the Triad boss but the cop ends up avenging Jeffrey even though the man surrendered thus getting arrested. This ending left me a little sad after watching this movie but I think the point of this ending was that Jeffrey ultimately realizes his sins too late and thus gets punished in the worst way possible in the end. The cop makes the sacrifice he does because he realizes that him getting arrested wasn't good enough and sometimes you gotta break the rules to make the world a better place. The Killer is stylish, exciting, thoughtful, intelligent, and wonderfully well-nuanced and because of that, I am gonna give it a 9/10.

    The Killer is perhaps the most melodramatic of John Woo's blood operas, but there's an inexplicable charm to his work that never lets it come off as manipulative or cloying. Partly because Woo seems to be an incredibly thoughtful, merciful man who gives his scripts a great deal of poetic irony, and partly because it's very obviously a modern take on an entire culture of chivalry & swordplay stories; unlike most sentimentalism, it's not empty. There's a bit of a camp appeal to Chow Yun-Fat mowing down 50 guys in a clip considering the movie's all about mercy and Christian pacifism, but it's so sincere and lovable. Woo branches out a little here and in effect sorta comes in to his own. There's a gaudy French new wave vibe to the visuals that perfectly matches the unrealistic, Romantic heights of the drama, and the violence takes the "sliiiiightly over-the-top" action of A Better Tomorrow to such an absurdly ballistic extent that it looks more like some fireworks+martial arts combination than gunplay. Yet, stuff like The Matrix remains a bad caricature of this movie; there's still a grit and old-fashioned physicality to Woo's action you don't see in Hollywood. Performances are perfectly broad. There's one notable exchange with no dialogue, just facial expressions, and although the actors do mug the camera a bit, it's perfect--they're screaming at each other without words. The pyrotechnics of the gun battles are obviously glamourized, yet Woo does his best to give it all a certain moral weight. It's an interesting juxtaposition; when the protagonist flips a guy over a counter and stabs him right in the spine with a butcher knife, it seems so much worse than the guys catching bullets in their skulls by the truckload, and that says volumes about the movie's intentions as well as our own expectations when it comes to this kind of violence. There's a kind of inevitable hypocrisy to such an uneasy negotiation between excessive pulp and romantic chivalry, but nothing feels cheap.

    An Asian Superstar Director and Actor, John Woo and Chow Yun Fat, were burning up screens and thrilling Movie Goers before coming to America. Their reputations precede them. Their reception here was nothing less than phenomenal. Critics and Audiences wallowed in the over the top accentuation of Violence coated with maudlin Melodrama. As History would have it, American Movies were never the same. This unabashed Director was supremely influential and his Films, both Hong Kong and American have a distinct Style that cannot be dismissed or overlooked. He delivers Movies infused with adrenaline and patched with Pathos. They all have an unreal feel and thus are set apart from the Genre they inhabit. The Killer and some of his other Hong Kong Films are rough and raw Woo, lacking the Hollywood budgets but never lacking Entertainment Value or interest. This one could be considered his best Non-American Movie but that takes nothing away from the others. They are all stamped with a saturation of take-notice Expressionistic Art and all magnetically draw one into its World of exaggeration and excess. There is much to admire in this Film with its constant ping-pong of outrageous gun battles and deep emotional compassion. There is an over abundance of everything and that makes this a very different experience than the average Action/Crime Flick. John Woo applies his Artistic strokes with a powerful high compression air-brush and never uses a single-hair stroke. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is the appeal.

    The Killer was a classic crime drama about a hit-man named Ah Jong (played by Chow Yun Fat) who decides he's had enough and wants to leave the life of an assassin for good unfortunately during the hit something unexpected occurs. A young singer named Jenny (played by Sally Yeh) is there at the wrong place at the wrong time and Ah Jong accidentally injures her eyes. This prompts Ah Jong to hold off his retirement to take one more job to pay for Jenny's operation to get her vision back to normal. This was a classic crime/action drama and I thought there really was chemistry between Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh along with the great performances of many of the cast at least including Danny Lee who is on par with Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh with his performance of Inspector Li Ying of the Hong Kong Police!

    Many people that view this movie today will probably think of it as cheesy and overrated, especially now with all the slick CGI action films out left and right. At the time that the film came out, it was pretty revolutionary. It put John Woo on the map for his cinematic style that would influence many films to come and to this date, it's clear his influence hasn't left. In my opinion, this movie is a classic in the action genre. John Woo made A Better Tomorrow Parts 1 & 2 prior to The Killer, and they were definitely good, but The Killer reached perfection when compared. His slick camera moves and seamless action were polished. When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film. That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old. To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it. Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED. As for his Hollywood films, I really don't consider them in the same league as his original films. What happened to the days when there were actual stunts and real explosions???

    I'm a 21 year old male. My father had a DVD of this on the shelf, and having never heard of it, I looked it up on IMDb... 7.9 eh? I'll give it a try. Being from 1989, I didn't expect much, but nothing this bad. The audio is atrocious. Guns sound fake, the punch noises are terrible, bad guys are apparently blind, and virtually none of the characters decisions make sense. The only reason I recommend watching this is to appreciate how far modern cinema has come (or how crappy foreign cinema was). Maybe if you're older than I am, it's fun to reminisce about when you saw this movie ages ago, but this is complete trash compared to any decent action film of the past 15 years. 1 star for 2013. Please, learn from my mistake and don't waste your time.

    A hit-man (Yun Fat) blinds a young woman during a violent assassination in a piano bar, and remorseful of his actions, seeks to atone for his crime by helping her to regain her sight. During the process he discovers he's no longer cut-out for his line of work, but before he can retire to the country, he must out-manoeuvre a relentless rogue detective (Lee) and contest the double-crossing mobster hell-bent on establishing his dominance. Yun Fat gives his character a moral fibre that is not especially unique to the hit-man's "code", though does venture further than the usual brand of perverse professionalism, to the extent that guilt erodes his self-confidence and ability to execute his assignments. Go-between and friend Chu Kong tries in vain to persuade him to remain loyal to the code, and the long standing partnership subsequently frays and re-galvanises out of sheer necessity as the pair (joined by the rogue detective) attempt to withstand some of the most fierce gun battles ever staged. Cleverly orchestrated plot enables a rich and vivid tale to emerge, expressed through characters who exude a strong sense of dignity but who struggle with the weight of guilt. Danny Lee is at times hilariously over-bearing, though how much of that is attributable to the banal dubbing is debatable. There's more than a little homosexual undertone present in the camaraderie between Yun Fat and his co-stars, and it's an element that exposes their human frailties, making the characters more accessible to the audience. The characters are smooth, sophisticated and eloquent and Woo's choreographed plot is highly stylised and intricate in visual detail, so much so that the gun battles look like classical ballets. Probably doesn't translate to most Western audiences, but it's a ground-breaker in its reach nonetheless and if you can withstand the occasionally corny dubbing (Dumbo and Mickey Mouse nicknames for example, which can be a comical distraction), then you should enjoy the experience.

    As an avid film buff and a guy who has seen over 4000 movies, I can only say that this illogical, ridiculously plotted, written, acted, shot and directed steamy piece of crap was one of the only movies that I watched out of curiosity and fast-forwarded from half to the stupid and bloody ending. The acting is soooooooooooooooooo abysmal and the central character who's supposed to be a super-macho dude is so gay that I thought I wish I had eaten 10 pounds of lard than watching this ludicrous garbage of a movie. Rather than an homage - which is what it's reputed to be - to Melville's Le Samoura&iuml;, it's an insult to that landmark masterpiece. Please avoid this at any price! Simply, One of the worst movies of my life.

    John Woo is a sensitive new age guy who is probably busting to make a period drama filled with romance, lush backdrops, glorious costumes and electrifying dialogue. It just so happens that his primary skill is choreographing hugely elaborate gunfights with insanely high bodycounts and much bloodletting. Such is the case with The Killer, the film opens with peaceful music, an opulent candelit backdrop  replete with the requisite white doves  and a handsome guy giving a friendly smile at the nice lady in the club who is singing beautifully for the appreciative patrons. Then with a start action-Woo takes over, perhaps realising that a mortgage payment is due and that doves, smiles and pan-pipes don't pay the bills. The smiling guy is Jeff (Chow Yun Fat), a contract assassin in the club on business. He sets about his tasks and 73 spurting squib-assisted deaths later he can knock off for the day Unfortunately in the hail of bullets and cacophony of death cries and splintering shrapnel Jeff managed to inadvertently blind the nice singing lady named Jenny with the powder blast from one of his many death dealing shots. Being the nice guy that he is he takes pity on Jenny and in the weeks that follow her release from hospital spends much time helping her readjust to her new sightless existence, and of course the two gradually fall in love  with Jenny never realising that her beau is in fact the very man who rendered her likely to fall over her own furniture As with every John Woo film the hero needs a counterpart, because without one there can be no Mexican standoff later in the film  and yes this film has more than one  the foil to Chow's killer is Inspector Lee, though they end up calling each other Mickey Mouse and Dumbo in much of the lamentable dialogue that permeates the 'waiting time' between shoot outs. Jeff and Lee see similarities in each other despite standing on opposite sides of the law, another staple of Woo films, the bad guys aren't really that bad and the cops always seem to readily sympathise and even befriend them. But that said both men shoot often, shoot straight, and things (and people) tend to explode and be propelled upwards when they shoot them. And they each have numerous chances to shoot at things in glorious intricately designed lengthy sequences of carnage and explosions. (I had a joke about China needing a one-child policy because Chow Yun Fat killed all of the males in John Woo films, but even I dubbed it borderline racist.) I can't say that Jeff takes out hundreds of armed assailants single-handedly in this film, because even though he does take out that many he often utilises both hands, each gripping the pistol tightly as he flies all over the place taking out thugs and punks. The plot is merely a frame to hang some of the best shootouts in cinema history on, and the undeniable truth is that some of the non-shooty scenes are frankly pretty amateurish. But this is an action film, and when scrutinised as an action film is stands head and shoulders above many modern day pretenders. Jeff and Lee ultimately end up in a breathtaking showdown vs a never-ending horde of blindly (no pun intended) charging assailants who storm their church hideout about 6 at a time Left 4 Dead style. As they repel these invaders in stylish fashion they share an ongoing dialogue about how much they mean to each other and such, pausing only to grit their teeth and pick off still more would-be assassins. Even in near death situations John Woo still wants people to share their feelings... There is an ongoing argument over whether this and its companion piece Hard Boiled are truly classics or simply well choreographed bullet-operas. I'll just say that where action is concerned no-one stages a bloody shootout as well as Woo. I'd much rather watch this or Hard Boiled than any of the last 17 generic action flicks churned out by Hollywood. If I had to choose, I would rate the hospital shootout in Hard Boiled as better than anything in The Killer, but the church finale here does take a lot of beating also. Ultimately though you can't really go wrong with either. Final Rating  8.5 / 10. John Woo films are like the contestants for Miss Universe pageants  breathtaking to look at, but it's always slightly disappointing when they talk

When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film. That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old. To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it. Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED. As for his Hollywood films, I really don't consider them in the same league as his original films. What happened to the days when there were actual stunts and real explosions???

    I'm a 21 year old male. My father had a DVD of this on the shelf, and having never heard of it, I looked it up on IMDb... 7.9 eh? I'll give it a try. Being from 1989, I didn't expect much, but nothing this bad. The audio is atrocious. Guns sound fake, the punch noises are terrible, bad guys are apparently blind, and virtually none of the characters decisions make sense. The only reason I recommend watching this is to appreciate how far modern cinema has come (or how crappy foreign cinema was). Maybe if you're older than I am, it's fun to reminisce about when you saw this movie ages ago, but this is complete trash compared to any decent action film of the past 15 years. 1 star for 2013. Please, learn from my mistake and don't waste your time.

    A hit-man (Yun Fat) blinds a young woman during a violent assassination in a piano bar, and remorseful of his actions, seeks to atone for his crime by helping her to regain her sight. During the process he discovers he's no longer cut-out for his line of work, but before he can retire to the country, he must out-manoeuvre a relentless rogue detective (Lee) and contest the double-crossing mobster hell-bent on establishing his dominance. Yun Fat gives his character a moral fibre that is not especially unique to the hit-man's "code", though does venture further than the usual brand of perverse professionalism, to the extent that guilt erodes his self-confidence and ability to execute his assignments. Go-between and friend Chu Kong tries in vain to persuade him to remain loyal to the code, and the long standing partnership subsequently frays and re-galvanises out of sheer necessity as the pair (joined by the rogue detective) attempt to withstand some of the most fierce gun battles ever staged. Cleverly orchestrated plot enables a rich and vivid tale to emerge, expressed through characters who exude a strong sense of dignity but who struggle with the weight of guilt. Danny Lee is at times hilariously over-bearing, though how much of that is attributable to the banal dubbing is debatable. There's more than a little homosexual undertone present in the camaraderie between Yun Fat and his co-stars, and it's an element that exposes their human frailties, making the characters more accessible to the audience. The characters are smooth, sophisticated and eloquent and Woo's choreographed plot is highly stylised and intricate in visual detail, so much so that the gun battles look like classical ballets. Probably doesn't translate to most Western audiences, but it's a ground-breaker in its reach nonetheless and if you can withstand the occasionally corny dubbing (Dumbo and Mickey Mouse nicknames for example, which can be a comical distraction), then you should enjoy the experience.

    As an avid film buff and a guy who has seen over 4000 movies, I can only say that this illogical, ridiculously plotted, written, acted, shot and directed steamy piece of crap was one of the only movies that I watched out of curiosity and fast-forwarded from half to the stupid and bloody ending. The acting is soooooooooooooooooo abysmal and the central character who's supposed to be a super-macho dude is so gay that I thought I wish I had eaten 10 pounds of lard than watching this ludicrous garbage of a movie. Rather than an homage - which is what it's reputed to be - to Melville's Le Samoura&iuml;, it's an insult to that landmark masterpiece. Please avoid this at any price! Simply, One of the worst movies of my life.

    John Woo is a sensitive new age guy who is probably busting to make a period drama filled with romance, lush backdrops, glorious costumes and electrifying dialogue. It just so happens that his primary skill is choreographing hugely elaborate gunfights with insanely high bodycounts and much bloodletting. Such is the case with The Killer, the film opens with peaceful music, an opulent candelit backdrop  replete with the requisite white doves  and a handsome guy giving a friendly smile at the nice lady in the club who is singing beautifully for the appreciative patrons. Then with a start action-Woo takes over, perhaps realising that a mortgage payment is due and that doves, smiles and pan-pipes don't pay the bills. The smiling guy is Jeff (Chow Yun Fat), a contract assassin in the club on business. He sets about his tasks and 73 spurting squib-assisted deaths later he can knock off for the day Unfortunately in the hail of bullets and cacophony of death cries and splintering shrapnel Jeff managed to inadvertently blind the nice singing lady named Jenny with the powder blast from one of his many death dealing shots. Being the nice guy that he is he takes pity on Jenny and in the weeks that follow her release from hospital spends much time helping her readjust to her new sightless existence, and of course the two gradually fall in love  with Jenny never realising that her beau is in fact the very man who rendered her likely to fall over her own furniture As with every John Woo film the hero needs a counterpart, because without one there can be no Mexican standoff later in the film  and yes this film has more than one  the foil to Chow's killer is Inspector Lee, though they end up calling each other Mickey Mouse and Dumbo in much of the lamentable dialogue that permeates the 'waiting time' between shoot outs. Jeff and Lee see similarities in each other despite standing on opposite sides of the law, another staple of Woo films, the bad guys aren't really that bad and the cops always seem to readily sympathise and even befriend them. But that said both men shoot often, shoot straight, and things (and people) tend to explode and be propelled upwards when they shoot them. And they each have numerous chances to shoot at things in glorious intricately designed lengthy sequences of carnage and explosions. (I had a joke about China needing a one-child policy because Chow Yun Fat killed all of the males in John Woo films, but even I dubbed it borderline racist.) I can't say that Jeff takes out hundreds of armed assailants single-handedly in this film, because even though he does take out that many he often utilises both hands, each gripping the pistol tightly as he flies all over the place taking out thugs and punks. The plot is merely a frame to hang some of the best shootouts in cinema history on, and the undeniable truth is that some of the non-shooty scenes are frankly pretty amateurish. But this is an action film, and when scrutinised as an action film is stands head and shoulders above many modern day pretenders. Jeff and Lee ultimately end up in a breathtaking showdown vs a never-ending horde of blindly (no pun intended) charging assailants who storm their church hideout about 6 at a time Left 4 Dead style. As they repel these invaders in stylish fashion they share an ongoing dialogue about how much they mean to each other and such, pausing only to grit their teeth and pick off still more would-be assassins. Even in near death situations John Woo still wants people to share their feelings... There is an ongoing argument over whether this and its companion piece Hard Boiled are truly classics or simply well choreographed bullet-operas. I'll just say that where action is concerned no-one stages a bloody shootout as well as Woo. I'd much rather watch this or Hard Boiled than any of the last 17 generic action flicks churned out by Hollywood. If I had to choose, I would rate the hospital shootout in Hard Boiled as better than anything in The Killer, but the church finale here does take a lot of beating also. Ultimately though you can't really go wrong with either. Final Rating  8.5 / 10. John Woo films are like the contestants for Miss Universe pageants  breathtaking to look at, but it's always slightly disappointing when they talk

    John Woo (HARD BOILED, FACE/OFF) directs Chow Yun-Fat as a hit man with a code of honor who agrees to do one last job before retirement. However, he soon becomes double-crossed by his Triad employers after trying to protect a songstress (Sally Yeh). Teaming with an undercover cop (Danny Lee), the two leads get themselves involved in one of the most exciting showdowns in action cinema. What can I say? Woo is a filmmaker who knows how to balance the action scenes and the emotional moments within the operatic grand scale of THE KILLER. Chow Yun-Fat delivers his charismatic performance with the combination of Eastwood's THE MAN WITH NO NAME, Jean Reno's quiet, lone hit man in LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL and Steve McQueen's untouchable COOLER KING in THE GREAT ESCAPE. THE KILLER is an operatic, unforgettable and mind-blowing masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema.

    The Killer is one of the few action movies in the 80's that not only had spectacular action but also a lot of heart, soul, and emotion. It's also one of if not the most influential action films of all time, up there with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and The Terminator. But why is that, let's find out! First of all, The Killer is extremely stylized. It's action sequences aren't just typical Hollywood shootouts with explosions, machine guns, and one-liners. There's a lot of visual poetry going on here with white doves flying around and a lot of slow-motion being used. The action isn't the only thing that's stylized about this film, it's drama is also very stylized. John Woo's movies have a recurring theme of men bonding and becoming like brothers and it's very present here. In Hollywood, this might not happen because it's " too gay " but Woo seems to love men bonding becoming like brothers so all of the friendships in his films feel very genuine and real. The dramatic scenes in this film can come off melodramatic to some people but I think it's very powerful because of how believable their relationships are. Secondly, it actually has a good, dramatic story with complex characters and genuine emotions. Face it, most action movies are just simple escapist entertainment with a nice happy ending to put a smile on your face at the end. But The Killer is a little different. While it has all the action you want in an action movie, the script focuses more on developing our protagonist, Jeffrey(Chow-yun Fat) who is an assassin who accidentally blinds a singer with a muzzle flash in his gun during one of his assassination missions so he accepts one last job, hoping to use the money to help her recover her eyesight but he ends up getting betrayed by his Triad boss who now wants him dead. What's fascinating about his character is that he doesn't seem to be a bad man who just wants a new path but he seems to be a man with a good heart but made some bad choices due to his own questionable morality. He said to Jenny(the girl he blinded) he once thought that they deserved it but now he thinks differently. Perhaps he started his career not because of money but because he thinks he's doing something right but throughout this film, he learns that violence brings nothing but bloodshed. Almost every shootout in this film, something goes wrong for him. And by the end of the movie, he says he can't do this anymore and it's making him sick. In contrast, we have the cop learning an opposite lesson, that of you can't always follow the rules to solve things in the world. He starts out on a quest to take down Jeffrey but he slowly learns that he isn't just another assassin who kills for money but also a man with heart. So he breaks the rules by helping him on his mission to protect and recover Jenny's eyesight. The message of this movie is that ultimately the world isn't black and white and it's impressive how well- written this film is considering Woo was writing it as he was going along. Lastly, this movie is very brave with its ending. Most Hollywood flicks wouldn't go with this ending but since the Hong Kong film industry is more accepting of unhappy endings, this is what happens at the end. After a massive shootout in the church, Jeffrey gets shot and killed by the Triad boss but the cop ends up avenging Jeffrey even though the man surrendered thus getting arrested. This ending left me a little sad after watching this movie but I think the point of this ending was that Jeffrey ultimately realizes his sins too late and thus gets punished in the worst way possible in the end. The cop makes the sacrifice he does because he realizes that him getting arrested wasn't good enough and sometimes you gotta break the rules to make the world a better place. The Killer is stylish, exciting, thoughtful, intelligent, and wonderfully well-nuanced and because of that, I am gonna give it a 9/10.

    The Killer is perhaps the most melodramatic of John Woo's blood operas, but there's an inexplicable charm to his work that never lets it come off as manipulative or cloying. Partly because Woo seems to be an incredibly thoughtful, merciful man who gives his scripts a great deal of poetic irony, and partly because it's very obviously a modern take on an entire culture of chivalry & swordplay stories; unlike most sentimentalism, it's not empty. There's a bit of a camp appeal to Chow Yun-Fat mowing down 50 guys in a clip considering the movie's all about mercy and Christian pacifism, but it's so sincere and lovable. Woo branches out a little here and in effect sorta comes in to his own. There's a gaudy French new wave vibe to the visuals that perfectly matches the unrealistic, Romantic heights of the drama, and the violence takes the "sliiiiightly over-the-top" action of A Better Tomorrow to such an absurdly ballistic extent that it looks more like some fireworks+martial arts combination than gunplay. Yet, stuff like The Matrix remains a bad caricature of this movie; there's still a grit and old-fashioned physicality to Woo's action you don't see in Hollywood. Performances are perfectly broad. There's one notable exchange with no dialogue, just facial expressions, and although the actors do mug the camera a bit, it's perfect--they're screaming at each other without words. The pyrotechnics of the gun battles are obviously glamourized, yet Woo does his best to give it all a certain moral weight. It's an interesting juxtaposition; when the protagonist flips a guy over a counter and stabs him right in the spine with a butcher knife, it seems so much worse than the guys catching bullets in their skulls by the truckload, and that says volumes about the movie's intentions as well as our own expectations when it comes to this kind of violence. There's a kind of inevitable hypocrisy to such an uneasy negotiation between excessive pulp and romantic chivalry, but nothing feels cheap.

    An Asian Superstar Director and Actor, John Woo and Chow Yun Fat, were burning up screens and thrilling Movie Goers before coming to America. Their reputations precede them. Their reception here was nothing less than phenomenal. Critics and Audiences wallowed in the over the top accentuation of Violence coated with maudlin Melodrama. As History would have it, American Movies were never the same. This unabashed Director was supremely influential and his Films, both Hong Kong and American have a distinct Style that cannot be dismissed or overlooked. He delivers Movies infused with adrenaline and patched with Pathos. They all have an unreal feel and thus are set apart from the Genre they inhabit. The Killer and some of his other Hong Kong Films are rough and raw Woo, lacking the Hollywood budgets but never lacking Entertainment Value or interest. This one could be considered his best Non-American Movie but that takes nothing away from the others. They are all stamped with a saturation of take-notice Expressionistic Art and all magnetically draw one into its World of exaggeration and excess. There is much to admire in this Film with its constant ping-pong of outrageous gun battles and deep emotional compassion. There is an over abundance of everything and that makes this a very different experience than the average Action/Crime Flick. John Woo applies his Artistic strokes with a powerful high compression air-brush and never uses a single-hair stroke. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is the appeal.

    The Killer was a classic crime drama about a hit-man named Ah Jong (played by Chow Yun Fat) who decides he's had enough and wants to leave the life of an assassin for good unfortunately during the hit something unexpected occurs. A young singer named Jenny (played by Sally Yeh) is there at the wrong place at the wrong time and Ah Jong accidentally injures her eyes. This prompts Ah Jong to hold off his retirement to take one more job to pay for Jenny's operation to get her vision back to normal. This was a classic crime/action drama and I thought there really was chemistry between Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh along with the great performances of many of the cast at least including Danny Lee who is on par with Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh with his performance of Inspector Li Ying of the Hong Kong Police!

    Many people that view this movie today will probably think of it as cheesy and overrated, especially now with all the slick CGI action films out left and right. At the time that the film came out, it was pretty revolutionary. It put John Woo on the map for his cinematic style that would influence many films to come and to this date, it's clear his influence hasn't left. In my opinion, this movie is a classic in the action genre. John Woo made A Better Tomorrow Parts 1 & 2 prior to The Killer, and they were definitely good, but The Killer reached perfection when compared. His slick camera moves and seamless action were polished. When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film.

Teaming with an undercover cop (Danny Lee), the two leads get themselves involved in one of the most exciting showdowns in action cinema. What can I say? Woo is a filmmaker who knows how to balance the action scenes and the emotional moments within the operatic grand scale of THE KILLER. Chow Yun-Fat delivers his charismatic performance with the combination of Eastwood's THE MAN WITH NO NAME, Jean Reno's quiet, lone hit man in LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL and Steve McQueen's untouchable COOLER KING in THE GREAT ESCAPE. THE KILLER is an operatic, unforgettable and mind-blowing masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema.

    The Killer is one of the few action movies in the 80's that not only had spectacular action but also a lot of heart, soul, and emotion. It's also one of if not the most influential action films of all time, up there with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and The Terminator. But why is that, let's find out! First of all, The Killer is extremely stylized. It's action sequences aren't just typical Hollywood shootouts with explosions, machine guns, and one-liners. There's a lot of visual poetry going on here with white doves flying around and a lot of slow-motion being used. The action isn't the only thing that's stylized about this film, it's drama is also very stylized. John Woo's movies have a recurring theme of men bonding and becoming like brothers and it's very present here. In Hollywood, this might not happen because it's " too gay " but Woo seems to love men bonding becoming like brothers so all of the friendships in his films feel very genuine and real. The dramatic scenes in this film can come off melodramatic to some people but I think it's very powerful because of how believable their relationships are. Secondly, it actually has a good, dramatic story with complex characters and genuine emotions. Face it, most action movies are just simple escapist entertainment with a nice happy ending to put a smile on your face at the end. But The Killer is a little different. While it has all the action you want in an action movie, the script focuses more on developing our protagonist, Jeffrey(Chow-yun Fat) who is an assassin who accidentally blinds a singer with a muzzle flash in his gun during one of his assassination missions so he accepts one last job, hoping to use the money to help her recover her eyesight but he ends up getting betrayed by his Triad boss who now wants him dead. What's fascinating about his character is that he doesn't seem to be a bad man who just wants a new path but he seems to be a man with a good heart but made some bad choices due to his own questionable morality. He said to Jenny(the girl he blinded) he once thought that they deserved it but now he thinks differently. Perhaps he started his career not because of money but because he thinks he's doing something right but throughout this film, he learns that violence brings nothing but bloodshed. Almost every shootout in this film, something goes wrong for him. And by the end of the movie, he says he can't do this anymore and it's making him sick. In contrast, we have the cop learning an opposite lesson, that of you can't always follow the rules to solve things in the world. He starts out on a quest to take down Jeffrey but he slowly learns that he isn't just another assassin who kills for money but also a man with heart. So he breaks the rules by helping him on his mission to protect and recover Jenny's eyesight. The message of this movie is that ultimately the world isn't black and white and it's impressive how well- written this film is considering Woo was writing it as he was going along. Lastly, this movie is very brave with its ending. Most Hollywood flicks wouldn't go with this ending but since the Hong Kong film industry is more accepting of unhappy endings, this is what happens at the end. After a massive shootout in the church, Jeffrey gets shot and killed by the Triad boss but the cop ends up avenging Jeffrey even though the man surrendered thus getting arrested. This ending left me a little sad after watching this movie but I think the point of this ending was that Jeffrey ultimately realizes his sins too late and thus gets punished in the worst way possible in the end. The cop makes the sacrifice he does because he realizes that him getting arrested wasn't good enough and sometimes you gotta break the rules to make the world a better place. The Killer is stylish, exciting, thoughtful, intelligent, and wonderfully well-nuanced and because of that, I am gonna give it a 9/10.

    The Killer is perhaps the most melodramatic of John Woo's blood operas, but there's an inexplicable charm to his work that never lets it come off as manipulative or cloying. Partly because Woo seems to be an incredibly thoughtful, merciful man who gives his scripts a great deal of poetic irony, and partly because it's very obviously a modern take on an entire culture of chivalry & swordplay stories; unlike most sentimentalism, it's not empty. There's a bit of a camp appeal to Chow Yun-Fat mowing down 50 guys in a clip considering the movie's all about mercy and Christian pacifism, but it's so sincere and lovable. Woo branches out a little here and in effect sorta comes in to his own. There's a gaudy French new wave vibe to the visuals that perfectly matches the unrealistic, Romantic heights of the drama, and the violence takes the "sliiiiightly over-the-top" action of A Better Tomorrow to such an absurdly ballistic extent that it looks more like some fireworks+martial arts combination than gunplay. Yet, stuff like The Matrix remains a bad caricature of this movie; there's still a grit and old-fashioned physicality to Woo's action you don't see in Hollywood. Performances are perfectly broad. There's one notable exchange with no dialogue, just facial expressions, and although the actors do mug the camera a bit, it's perfect--they're screaming at each other without words. The pyrotechnics of the gun battles are obviously glamourized, yet Woo does his best to give it all a certain moral weight. It's an interesting juxtaposition; when the protagonist flips a guy over a counter and stabs him right in the spine with a butcher knife, it seems so much worse than the guys catching bullets in their skulls by the truckload, and that says volumes about the movie's intentions as well as our own expectations when it comes to this kind of violence. There's a kind of inevitable hypocrisy to such an uneasy negotiation between excessive pulp and romantic chivalry, but nothing feels cheap.

    An Asian Superstar Director and Actor, John Woo and Chow Yun Fat, were burning up screens and thrilling Movie Goers before coming to America. Their reputations precede them. Their reception here was nothing less than phenomenal. Critics and Audiences wallowed in the over the top accentuation of Violence coated with maudlin Melodrama. As History would have it, American Movies were never the same. This unabashed Director was supremely influential and his Films, both Hong Kong and American have a distinct Style that cannot be dismissed or overlooked. He delivers Movies infused with adrenaline and patched with Pathos. They all have an unreal feel and thus are set apart from the Genre they inhabit. The Killer and some of his other Hong Kong Films are rough and raw Woo, lacking the Hollywood budgets but never lacking Entertainment Value or interest. This one could be considered his best Non-American Movie but that takes nothing away from the others. They are all stamped with a saturation of take-notice Expressionistic Art and all magnetically draw one into its World of exaggeration and excess. There is much to admire in this Film with its constant ping-pong of outrageous gun battles and deep emotional compassion. There is an over abundance of everything and that makes this a very different experience than the average Action/Crime Flick. John Woo applies his Artistic strokes with a powerful high compression air-brush and never uses a single-hair stroke. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is the appeal.

    The Killer was a classic crime drama about a hit-man named Ah Jong (played by Chow Yun Fat) who decides he's had enough and wants to leave the life of an assassin for good unfortunately during the hit something unexpected occurs. A young singer named Jenny (played by Sally Yeh) is there at the wrong place at the wrong time and Ah Jong accidentally injures her eyes. This prompts Ah Jong to hold off his retirement to take one more job to pay for Jenny's operation to get her vision back to normal. This was a classic crime/action drama and I thought there really was chemistry between Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh along with the great performances of many of the cast at least including Danny Lee who is on par with Chow Yun Fat and Sally Yeh with his performance of Inspector Li Ying of the Hong Kong Police!

    Many people that view this movie today will probably think of it as cheesy and overrated, especially now with all the slick CGI action films out left and right. At the time that the film came out, it was pretty revolutionary. It put John Woo on the map for his cinematic style that would influence many films to come and to this date, it's clear his influence hasn't left. In my opinion, this movie is a classic in the action genre. John Woo made A Better Tomorrow Parts 1 & 2 prior to The Killer, and they were definitely good, but The Killer reached perfection when compared. His slick camera moves and seamless action were polished. When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film. That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old. To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it. Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED. As for his Hollywood films, I really don't consider them in the same league as his original films. What happened to the days when there were actual stunts and real explosions???

    I'm a 21 year old male. My father had a DVD of this on the shelf, and having never heard of it, I looked it up on IMDb... 7.9 eh? I'll give it a try. Being from 1989, I didn't expect much, but nothing this bad. The audio is atrocious. Guns sound fake, the punch noises are terrible, bad guys are apparently blind, and virtually none of the characters decisions make sense. The only reason I recommend watching this is to appreciate how far modern cinema has come (or how crappy foreign cinema was). Maybe if you're older than I am, it's fun to reminisce about when you saw this movie ages ago, but this is complete trash compared to any decent action film of the past 15 years. 1 star for 2013. Please, learn from my mistake and don't waste your time.

    A hit-man (Yun Fat) blinds a young woman during a violent assassination in a piano bar, and remorseful of his actions, seeks to atone for his crime by helping her to regain her sight. During the process he discovers he's no longer cut-out for his line of work, but before he can retire to the country, he must out-manoeuvre a relentless rogue detective (Lee) and contest the double-crossing mobster hell-bent on establishing his dominance. Yun Fat gives his character a moral fibre that is not especially unique to the hit-man's "code", though does venture further than the usual brand of perverse professionalism, to the extent that guilt erodes his self-confidence and ability to execute his assignments. Go-between and friend Chu Kong tries in vain to persuade him to remain loyal to the code, and the long standing partnership subsequently frays and re-galvanises out of sheer necessity as the pair (joined by the rogue detective) attempt to withstand some of the most fierce gun battles ever staged. Cleverly orchestrated plot enables a rich and vivid tale to emerge, expressed through characters who exude a strong sense of dignity but who struggle with the weight of guilt. Danny Lee is at times hilariously over-bearing, though how much of that is attributable to the banal dubbing is debatable. There's more than a little homosexual undertone present in the camaraderie between Yun Fat and his co-stars, and it's an element that exposes their human frailties, making the characters more accessible to the audience. The characters are smooth, sophisticated and eloquent and Woo's choreographed plot is highly stylised and intricate in visual detail, so much so that the gun battles look like classical ballets. Probably doesn't translate to most Western audiences, but it's a ground-breaker in its reach nonetheless and if you can withstand the occasionally corny dubbing (Dumbo and Mickey Mouse nicknames for example, which can be a comical distraction), then you should enjoy the experience.

    As an avid film buff and a guy who has seen over 4000 movies, I can only say that this illogical, ridiculously plotted, written, acted, shot and directed steamy piece of crap was one of the only movies that I watched out of curiosity and fast-forwarded from half to the stupid and bloody ending. The acting is soooooooooooooooooo abysmal and the central character who's supposed to be a super-macho dude is so gay that I thought I wish I had eaten 10 pounds of lard than watching this ludicrous garbage of a movie. Rather than an homage - which is what it's reputed to be - to Melville's Le Samoura&iuml;, it's an insult to that landmark masterpiece. Please avoid this at any price! Simply, One of the worst movies of my life.

    John Woo is a sensitive new age guy who is probably busting to make a period drama filled with romance, lush backdrops, glorious costumes and electrifying dialogue. It just so happens that his primary skill is choreographing hugely elaborate gunfights with insanely high bodycounts and much bloodletting. Such is the case with The Killer, the film opens with peaceful music, an opulent candelit backdrop  replete with the requisite white doves  and a handsome guy giving a friendly smile at the nice lady in the club who is singing beautifully for the appreciative patrons. Then with a start action-Woo takes over, perhaps realising that a mortgage payment is due and that doves, smiles and pan-pipes don't pay the bills. The smiling guy is Jeff (Chow Yun Fat), a contract assassin in the club on business. He sets about his tasks and 73 spurting squib-assisted deaths later he can knock off for the day Unfortunately in the hail of bullets and cacophony of death cries and splintering shrapnel Jeff managed to inadvertently blind the nice singing lady named Jenny with the powder blast from one of his many death dealing shots. Being the nice guy that he is he takes pity on Jenny and in the weeks that follow her release from hospital spends much time helping her readjust to her new sightless existence, and of course the two gradually fall in love  with Jenny never realising that her beau is in fact the very man who rendered her likely to fall over her own furniture As with every John Woo film the hero needs a counterpart, because without one there can be no Mexican standoff later in the film  and yes this film has more than one  the foil to Chow's killer is Inspector Lee, though they end up calling each other Mickey Mouse and Dumbo in much of the lamentable dialogue that permeates the 'waiting time' between shoot outs. Jeff and Lee see similarities in each other despite standing on opposite sides of the law, another staple of Woo films, the bad guys aren't really that bad and the cops always seem to readily sympathise and even befriend them. But that said both men shoot often, shoot straight, and things (and people) tend to explode and be propelled upwards when they shoot them. And they each have numerous chances to shoot at things in glorious intricately designed lengthy sequences of carnage and explosions. (I had a joke about China needing a one-child policy because Chow Yun Fat killed all of the males in John Woo films, but even I dubbed it borderline racist.) I can't say that Jeff takes out hundreds of armed assailants single-handedly in this film, because even though he does take out that many he often utilises both hands, each gripping the pistol tightly as he flies all over the place taking out thugs and punks. The plot is merely a frame to hang some of the best shootouts in cinema history on, and the undeniable truth is that some of the non-shooty scenes are frankly pretty amateurish. But this is an action film, and when scrutinised as an action film is stands head and shoulders above many modern day pretenders. Jeff and Lee ultimately end up in a breathtaking showdown vs a never-ending horde of blindly (no pun intended) charging assailants who storm their church hideout about 6 at a time Left 4 Dead style. As they repel these invaders in stylish fashion they share an ongoing dialogue about how much they mean to each other and such, pausing only to grit their teeth and pick off still more would-be assassins. Even in near death situations John Woo still wants people to share their feelings... There is an ongoing argument over whether this and its companion piece Hard Boiled are truly classics or simply well choreographed bullet-operas. I'll just say that where action is concerned no-one stages a bloody shootout as well as Woo. I'd much rather watch this or Hard Boiled than any of the last 17 generic action flicks churned out by Hollywood. If I had to choose, I would rate the hospital shootout in Hard Boiled as better than anything in The Killer, but the church finale here does take a lot of beating also. Ultimately though you can't really go wrong with either. Final Rating  8.5 / 10. John Woo films are like the contestants for Miss Universe pageants  breathtaking to look at, but it's always slightly disappointing when they talk
