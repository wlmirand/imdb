    I found this movie to be a complete garbage, like most of the movies starring (or directed) by Mel Gibson. (I think that "The Passion of the Christ" might be one of the very few notorious exceptions) This movie is pathetic and boring. It lacked an interesting, likable characters or any kind of redeeming value. There simply wasn't anything good about this atrocious film. It was a terrible film, and it was the worst Ron Howard movie, along with his "Da Vinci Code" film (A terrible adaptation of an equally terrible book) and the dreadful "Angels & Demons". If you want to see a good movie directed by Ron Howard see "Cinderella Man" or "Apollo 13" and skip this nonsense.

    Yes, I enjoyed watching this movie - even though it felt at times that it would never end. It looks like there are enough reviews on here praising its technical "merits" by Hollywood criteria. I for one do not think the acting had much quality or depth to it at all (Gibson's is really inconsistent/ delirious), nor would I say at all that this is a "good" film story, just an enjoyable one, and a compelling one for the following reason; This is possibly the most thinly-veiled cinematic propagation of a Neoliberal capitalist mentality I have seen - from the mid-nineties: White collar criminal (Gibson) gains his redemption / dignity and the respect of his family and government (the skeptical FBI agent (Lindo)) by pursuing a stubborn, risky path of non-negotiation (which jeopardizes the life of his son). Gibson's character refuses to pay-off the "human garbage" who could partially be seen to represent an extralegal justice.. and effectively pits the actors who constitute the threat to his decadent life against one another; the competition literally destroys itself -for the most part. The final scene is the most unbelievable, where we see the corporate 'hero' disobey the faithful but ineffective state - the officers demanding that he "drop the gun", who failed to take down the wayward dissatisfied officer from their ranks. A sort of case for the benefits of extreme self-interest, privatization, deregulation of business, realpolitik, etc.? This is an interesting watch as it significantly predates the wall street crash, the more contemporary political-economic policy that one would associate with this sort of message, and the more recent flashier action films (i.e. Nolan's Dark Knight, Miller's 300 etc) that are recognizable now as the Hollywood promotion of (I would say quite TOXIC) Neoliberalism. Thanks for reading.

    I watched this movie first when it came out and I was only about 11 years old or so. So I decided to give it a watch nearly ten years later and I loved it even more. Its not a very original idea and it has been done before but the writing and the great performance by Mel Gibson make this far superior to most of the movies with this subject. This movie is about a well off boss of an airline who while at the park with his family one day has his son kidnapped. The kidnappers ask for a two million dollars ransom. The father is going to pay without any questions until he starts thinking that once he pays they will kill his son so he comes up with a back up plan. This is a really good thriller and another great movie from Gibson. I have always been a Gibson fan and I only wish he made more movies these days.

    Ron Howard and Mel Gibson have a thing in common. Unreliability of excellence. Both have done exceptional work, but some of it not so. This is ironically a meeting of those inconsistencies in a movie that is not the best or the worst of either. The blending of the two talented, if spotty, mega-stars ends up being a glaring case of highlighted mediocrity not superiority. The overacting and totally unbelievable Gibson uses many mannerisms of his earlier films and seems unable to play any emotion except righteous indignation, and that he does well. But here he is called upon to emote and react with heartfelt feelings that come off as hammy and borderline horrendous. His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police. The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing. The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.

    ***SPOILERS*** Mel Gibson as Endeavor Airline President Tom Mullen is put on the spot when his 12 year old son Sean,Brawley Nolte,is kidnapped by a gang of hoods lead one of New York's Finest hero cop Let. Jimmy Shaker, Gary Sinise. It's in him feeling low paid, like getting $80,000.00 plus a year isn't enough for him!, and him being a disrespected member of the working class cop Shaker had all his life developed a deep seeded hatred of anyone with money. And he sees Mullen and his family as perfect targets for his insane paranoia against the rich and famous which he considers Tom Mullen to be member of. As it later turns out the two million dollars in ransom money he want's for Sean safe return is just a cover in what Shaker really wanted in having it both ways: Getting the money and at the same time killing the innocent Sean to satisfy his both blood and money lust! It take's a while for Tom to figure out just what a low-life piece of you know what Shanker really is, far lower then his lame brain accomplices,and decides to play a game of chicken with him against the advice of his wife Kate, Rene Russo, and the FBI Agent in charge of the kidnap case Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Delroy Lindo. Going on TV to make an announcement to his son's kidnappers Tom instead of paying up tell the shocked and at the same time confused hoods that the 2 million he's got in ransom money is now a bounty on their heads for anyone who can track them down and bring them to justice! That's unless they return Sean safely and unharmed to him and Kate. With the heat now on the kidnappers they start to unravel and it's hero cop Shanker who's the first to jump ship! Not in turning himself in and releasing Sean but gunning down in cold blood his cohorts and making it look like he save Sean from his kidnappers! In the process of his "heroic action" Shanker is shot and wounded by his fellow kidnapper and lover Maris Connor,Lili Taylor, who in return Shaker blasts to kingdom come. ***SPOILERS*** Now things really start getting interesting with Shanker wanting to collect his hard earned 4 million, Tom had since doubled the bounty price, that he murdered some half dozen people for and jumps the gun by showing up at Tom's fifth Ave penthouse to collect. That instead of waiting a few day for the hero of the years ceremony at City Hall where he's to be given the four million dollar check by both Tom and the Mayor of the City of New York! Slasher like ending with both Tom and Shaker having it out at the bank where he's,Tom, to deposit the four million dollar check into an off shore account in Shanker's name. Tom had gotten the lowdown to who Shaker really is, Sean's kidnapper, by seeing Sean wetting his pants when he heard his voice, at the Mullen penthouse, the same voice he heard when he was held kidnapped and blindfold by Shaker and his gang. This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!

    A loose remake of the film of the same name, Ron Howard's 'Ransom' is A Brilliant Film! An edgy, violent & captivating thriller. Also, Mel Gibson is Excellent! 'Ransom' Synopsis: When a rich man's son is kidnapped, he cooperates with the police at first but then tries a unique tactic against the criminals. 'Ransom' is edgy, violent, challenging & captivating. A Thriller that has it all. It arrested Me from Scene A to Z. Richard Price & Alexander Ignon's Screenplay is top-notch! Ron Howard's Direction, Like Always, is interesting. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Art & Costume Design are fair. Performance-Wise: As mentioned before, Mel Gibson is Excellent! The Legendary Actor delivers one of his finest performances ever. Gary Sinise plays the villain, most convincingly, essaying his part with ease & venom. Rene Russo is flawless. Brawley Nolte does very well. Delroy Lindo leaves a terrific impact. On the whole, 'Ransom' is a knock-out! Two Thumbs Up!

    This film had ONE good idea, which was revealed, with much fanfare, about halfway through. Unfortunately it was also revealed in the trailers. Even a ten-second TV ad, which had no time to tell us anything else, told us the one thing that ought to have been kept secret. It must be said that this wasn't the movie's fault; but if knowing the central conceit in advance makes it pointless to actually watch the movie, that IS the movie's fault. I knew what the surprise in 'Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to 'Psycho' than just one idea. Anyway: 'Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.

    Ransom is not really a bad movie, but it's nothing special, either. Its plot is somewhat believable, yet quite predictable as well as full of clich&eacute;s and improbable decisions. The performances are solid, although Mel Gibson does overact on a few occasions in the title role of an airline tycoon named Tom Mullen. Gary Sinise is very good as the main villain, a dirty detective named Jimmy Shaker. However, his character is revealed as the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Mullen's son very early in the movie, which completely ruins the possibility of a good plot twist. The whole kidnapping scene was quite unlikely. Tom attends a science fair with his wife Kate and their son Sean. They seem to attend the fair without any bodyguards despite the fact that Tom not only owns a successful airline, but is also investigated by the FBI for allegedly bribing a union official. He was also way too careless when he lets Sean play in the crowd right before he gets kidnapped. There's a lot of very well-known plot elements throughout the movie. When the kidnappers call the Mullens for the first time, they ask them not to involve the police. Of course, they do not follow the instructions and call the FBI, whose team soon secretly arrives at their New York penthouse. While talking to the team leader, Tom also admits that he had indeed bribed the union official. Of course, he is not arrested at the end of the movie. There is also a failed drop-off sequence, after which the kidnapping becomes public. Tom then appears on TV, turning the 2-million-dollar ransom into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. He also soon increases the amount to 4 million. After that, the movie becomes fairly predictable. Shaker kills his accomplices and "saves" Sean. The other day, Tom is out there with his wife and son. He goes back to their apartment to quickly pick up something when Shaker shows up to collect the bounty. Sean and Kate arrive soon after Tom, and Sean recognizes Shaker as the kidnappers' leader. Shaker becomes totally gullible after that. He first easily reveals his true identity and holds Tom at gunpoint. They drive to the bank to transfer the money. On the way, Shaker makes another ridiculous mistake when he forces Tom to call the airport so he can book a private flight. Of course, Tom calls the FBI, and the police are soon informed to arrest Shaker. Upon leaving the bank, Shaker kills a couple of cops and the final showdown with Tom ensues. The showdown was quite boring, and I was just waiting for the movie to end as soon as possible.

    The premise of this movie is that a father becomes convinced that the kidnappers of his son will kill his boy even if he pays up; in his desperation he goes rogue, offering money for anyone who helps find the abductors instead... ... which might seem like a good idea on screen, but is a horrible one if you have the slightest demand for realism. It was quite ridiculous to watch the ruthless kidnapper-boss getting himself all pumped up over Mel's strategy. In real life Mel would have probably received an envelope with his son's fingers each day he wasn't paying. I mean come on- there are plenty of things one can do short of killing that would have made anyone in the world pay in half an hour. So yeah, the acting was good, the action OK, the movie as a whole entertaining, but it's hard to give it a good mark if its core idea doesn't work.

I knew what the surprise in 'Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to 'Psycho' than just one idea. Anyway: 'Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.

    Ransom is not really a bad movie, but it's nothing special, either. Its plot is somewhat believable, yet quite predictable as well as full of clich&eacute;s and improbable decisions. The performances are solid, although Mel Gibson does overact on a few occasions in the title role of an airline tycoon named Tom Mullen. Gary Sinise is very good as the main villain, a dirty detective named Jimmy Shaker. However, his character is revealed as the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Mullen's son very early in the movie, which completely ruins the possibility of a good plot twist. The whole kidnapping scene was quite unlikely. Tom attends a science fair with his wife Kate and their son Sean. They seem to attend the fair without any bodyguards despite the fact that Tom not only owns a successful airline, but is also investigated by the FBI for allegedly bribing a union official. He was also way too careless when he lets Sean play in the crowd right before he gets kidnapped. There's a lot of very well-known plot elements throughout the movie. When the kidnappers call the Mullens for the first time, they ask them not to involve the police. Of course, they do not follow the instructions and call the FBI, whose team soon secretly arrives at their New York penthouse. While talking to the team leader, Tom also admits that he had indeed bribed the union official. Of course, he is not arrested at the end of the movie. There is also a failed drop-off sequence, after which the kidnapping becomes public. Tom then appears on TV, turning the 2-million-dollar ransom into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. He also soon increases the amount to 4 million. After that, the movie becomes fairly predictable. Shaker kills his accomplices and "saves" Sean. The other day, Tom is out there with his wife and son. He goes back to their apartment to quickly pick up something when Shaker shows up to collect the bounty. Sean and Kate arrive soon after Tom, and Sean recognizes Shaker as the kidnappers' leader. Shaker becomes totally gullible after that. He first easily reveals his true identity and holds Tom at gunpoint. They drive to the bank to transfer the money. On the way, Shaker makes another ridiculous mistake when he forces Tom to call the airport so he can book a private flight. Of course, Tom calls the FBI, and the police are soon informed to arrest Shaker. Upon leaving the bank, Shaker kills a couple of cops and the final showdown with Tom ensues. The showdown was quite boring, and I was just waiting for the movie to end as soon as possible.

    The premise of this movie is that a father becomes convinced that the kidnappers of his son will kill his boy even if he pays up; in his desperation he goes rogue, offering money for anyone who helps find the abductors instead... ... which might seem like a good idea on screen, but is a horrible one if you have the slightest demand for realism. It was quite ridiculous to watch the ruthless kidnapper-boss getting himself all pumped up over Mel's strategy. In real life Mel would have probably received an envelope with his son's fingers each day he wasn't paying. I mean come on- there are plenty of things one can do short of killing that would have made anyone in the world pay in half an hour. So yeah, the acting was good, the action OK, the movie as a whole entertaining, but it's hard to give it a good mark if its core idea doesn't work.

    I found this movie to be a complete garbage, like most of the movies starring (or directed) by Mel Gibson. (I think that "The Passion of the Christ" might be one of the very few notorious exceptions) This movie is pathetic and boring. It lacked an interesting, likable characters or any kind of redeeming value. There simply wasn't anything good about this atrocious film. It was a terrible film, and it was the worst Ron Howard movie, along with his "Da Vinci Code" film (A terrible adaptation of an equally terrible book) and the dreadful "Angels & Demons". If you want to see a good movie directed by Ron Howard see "Cinderella Man" or "Apollo 13" and skip this nonsense.

    Yes, I enjoyed watching this movie - even though it felt at times that it would never end. It looks like there are enough reviews on here praising its technical "merits" by Hollywood criteria. I for one do not think the acting had much quality or depth to it at all (Gibson's is really inconsistent/ delirious), nor would I say at all that this is a "good" film story, just an enjoyable one, and a compelling one for the following reason; This is possibly the most thinly-veiled cinematic propagation of a Neoliberal capitalist mentality I have seen - from the mid-nineties: White collar criminal (Gibson) gains his redemption / dignity and the respect of his family and government (the skeptical FBI agent (Lindo)) by pursuing a stubborn, risky path of non-negotiation (which jeopardizes the life of his son). Gibson's character refuses to pay-off the "human garbage" who could partially be seen to represent an extralegal justice.. and effectively pits the actors who constitute the threat to his decadent life against one another; the competition literally destroys itself -for the most part. The final scene is the most unbelievable, where we see the corporate 'hero' disobey the faithful but ineffective state - the officers demanding that he "drop the gun", who failed to take down the wayward dissatisfied officer from their ranks. A sort of case for the benefits of extreme self-interest, privatization, deregulation of business, realpolitik, etc.? This is an interesting watch as it significantly predates the wall street crash, the more contemporary political-economic policy that one would associate with this sort of message, and the more recent flashier action films (i.e. Nolan's Dark Knight, Miller's 300 etc) that are recognizable now as the Hollywood promotion of (I would say quite TOXIC) Neoliberalism. Thanks for reading.

    I watched this movie first when it came out and I was only about 11 years old or so. So I decided to give it a watch nearly ten years later and I loved it even more. Its not a very original idea and it has been done before but the writing and the great performance by Mel Gibson make this far superior to most of the movies with this subject. This movie is about a well off boss of an airline who while at the park with his family one day has his son kidnapped. The kidnappers ask for a two million dollars ransom. The father is going to pay without any questions until he starts thinking that once he pays they will kill his son so he comes up with a back up plan. This is a really good thriller and another great movie from Gibson. I have always been a Gibson fan and I only wish he made more movies these days.

    Ron Howard and Mel Gibson have a thing in common. Unreliability of excellence. Both have done exceptional work, but some of it not so. This is ironically a meeting of those inconsistencies in a movie that is not the best or the worst of either. The blending of the two talented, if spotty, mega-stars ends up being a glaring case of highlighted mediocrity not superiority. The overacting and totally unbelievable Gibson uses many mannerisms of his earlier films and seems unable to play any emotion except righteous indignation, and that he does well. But here he is called upon to emote and react with heartfelt feelings that come off as hammy and borderline horrendous. His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police. The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing. The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.

    ***SPOILERS*** Mel Gibson as Endeavor Airline President Tom Mullen is put on the spot when his 12 year old son Sean,Brawley Nolte,is kidnapped by a gang of hoods lead one of New York's Finest hero cop Let. Jimmy Shaker, Gary Sinise. It's in him feeling low paid, like getting $80,000.00 plus a year isn't enough for him!, and him being a disrespected member of the working class cop Shaker had all his life developed a deep seeded hatred of anyone with money. And he sees Mullen and his family as perfect targets for his insane paranoia against the rich and famous which he considers Tom Mullen to be member of. As it later turns out the two million dollars in ransom money he want's for Sean safe return is just a cover in what Shaker really wanted in having it both ways: Getting the money and at the same time killing the innocent Sean to satisfy his both blood and money lust! It take's a while for Tom to figure out just what a low-life piece of you know what Shanker really is, far lower then his lame brain accomplices,and decides to play a game of chicken with him against the advice of his wife Kate, Rene Russo, and the FBI Agent in charge of the kidnap case Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Delroy Lindo. Going on TV to make an announcement to his son's kidnappers Tom instead of paying up tell the shocked and at the same time confused hoods that the 2 million he's got in ransom money is now a bounty on their heads for anyone who can track them down and bring them to justice! That's unless they return Sean safely and unharmed to him and Kate. With the heat now on the kidnappers they start to unravel and it's hero cop Shanker who's the first to jump ship! Not in turning himself in and releasing Sean but gunning down in cold blood his cohorts and making it look like he save Sean from his kidnappers! In the process of his "heroic action" Shanker is shot and wounded by his fellow kidnapper and lover Maris Connor,Lili Taylor, who in return Shaker blasts to kingdom come. ***SPOILERS*** Now things really start getting interesting with Shanker wanting to collect his hard earned 4 million, Tom had since doubled the bounty price, that he murdered some half dozen people for and jumps the gun by showing up at Tom's fifth Ave penthouse to collect. That instead of waiting a few day for the hero of the years ceremony at City Hall where he's to be given the four million dollar check by both Tom and the Mayor of the City of New York! Slasher like ending with both Tom and Shaker having it out at the bank where he's,Tom, to deposit the four million dollar check into an off shore account in Shanker's name. Tom had gotten the lowdown to who Shaker really is, Sean's kidnapper, by seeing Sean wetting his pants when he heard his voice, at the Mullen penthouse, the same voice he heard when he was held kidnapped and blindfold by Shaker and his gang. This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!

    Mel Gibson, Rene Russo and Gary Sinise star in Ron Howard's 1996 thriller. A millionaire threatens the kidnappers who abducted his son. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is a millionaire in charge of an airline. He has a wife, Kate (Russo) and son, Sean (Brawley Nolte). Sean becomes kidnapped by a ruthless cop, Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) who wants money from Tom. Tom and Kate are secretly helped by the F.B.I with the investigation. When Tom gets a ransom from the kidnappers, he threatens them by putting the money as a bounty on them and is determined to get Sean back no matter what the cost. Delroy Lindo, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg co-star. This is a great thriller and Gary is a good villain. I recommend this.

    A loose remake of the film of the same name, Ron Howard's 'Ransom' is A Brilliant Film! An edgy, violent & captivating thriller. Also, Mel Gibson is Excellent! 'Ransom' Synopsis: When a rich man's son is kidnapped, he cooperates with the police at first but then tries a unique tactic against the criminals. 'Ransom' is edgy, violent, challenging & captivating. A Thriller that has it all. It arrested Me from Scene A to Z. Richard Price & Alexander Ignon's Screenplay is top-notch! Ron Howard's Direction, Like Always, is interesting. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Art & Costume Design are fair. Performance-Wise: As mentioned before, Mel Gibson is Excellent! The Legendary Actor delivers one of his finest performances ever. Gary Sinise plays the villain, most convincingly, essaying his part with ease & venom. Rene Russo is flawless. Brawley Nolte does very well. Delroy Lindo leaves a terrific impact. On the whole, 'Ransom' is a knock-out! Two Thumbs Up!

    This film had ONE good idea, which was revealed, with much fanfare, about halfway through. Unfortunately it was also revealed in the trailers. Even a ten-second TV ad, which had no time to tell us anything else, told us the one thing that ought to have been kept secret. It must be said that this wasn't the movie's fault; but if knowing the central conceit in advance makes it pointless to actually watch the movie, that IS the movie's fault. I knew what the surprise in 'Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to 'Psycho' than just one idea. Anyway: 'Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.

Tom Mullen (Gibson) is a millionaire in charge of an airline. He has a wife, Kate (Russo) and son, Sean (Brawley Nolte). Sean becomes kidnapped by a ruthless cop, Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) who wants money from Tom. Tom and Kate are secretly helped by the F.B.I with the investigation. When Tom gets a ransom from the kidnappers, he threatens them by putting the money as a bounty on them and is determined to get Sean back no matter what the cost. Delroy Lindo, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg co-star. This is a great thriller and Gary is a good villain. I recommend this.

    A loose remake of the film of the same name, Ron Howard's 'Ransom' is A Brilliant Film! An edgy, violent & captivating thriller. Also, Mel Gibson is Excellent! 'Ransom' Synopsis: When a rich man's son is kidnapped, he cooperates with the police at first but then tries a unique tactic against the criminals. 'Ransom' is edgy, violent, challenging & captivating. A Thriller that has it all. It arrested Me from Scene A to Z. Richard Price & Alexander Ignon's Screenplay is top-notch! Ron Howard's Direction, Like Always, is interesting. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Art & Costume Design are fair. Performance-Wise: As mentioned before, Mel Gibson is Excellent! The Legendary Actor delivers one of his finest performances ever. Gary Sinise plays the villain, most convincingly, essaying his part with ease & venom. Rene Russo is flawless. Brawley Nolte does very well. Delroy Lindo leaves a terrific impact. On the whole, 'Ransom' is a knock-out! Two Thumbs Up!

    This film had ONE good idea, which was revealed, with much fanfare, about halfway through. Unfortunately it was also revealed in the trailers. Even a ten-second TV ad, which had no time to tell us anything else, told us the one thing that ought to have been kept secret. It must be said that this wasn't the movie's fault; but if knowing the central conceit in advance makes it pointless to actually watch the movie, that IS the movie's fault. I knew what the surprise in 'Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to 'Psycho' than just one idea. Anyway: 'Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.

    Ransom is not really a bad movie, but it's nothing special, either. Its plot is somewhat believable, yet quite predictable as well as full of clich&eacute;s and improbable decisions. The performances are solid, although Mel Gibson does overact on a few occasions in the title role of an airline tycoon named Tom Mullen. Gary Sinise is very good as the main villain, a dirty detective named Jimmy Shaker. However, his character is revealed as the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Mullen's son very early in the movie, which completely ruins the possibility of a good plot twist. The whole kidnapping scene was quite unlikely. Tom attends a science fair with his wife Kate and their son Sean. They seem to attend the fair without any bodyguards despite the fact that Tom not only owns a successful airline, but is also investigated by the FBI for allegedly bribing a union official. He was also way too careless when he lets Sean play in the crowd right before he gets kidnapped. There's a lot of very well-known plot elements throughout the movie. When the kidnappers call the Mullens for the first time, they ask them not to involve the police. Of course, they do not follow the instructions and call the FBI, whose team soon secretly arrives at their New York penthouse. While talking to the team leader, Tom also admits that he had indeed bribed the union official. Of course, he is not arrested at the end of the movie. There is also a failed drop-off sequence, after which the kidnapping becomes public. Tom then appears on TV, turning the 2-million-dollar ransom into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. He also soon increases the amount to 4 million. After that, the movie becomes fairly predictable. Shaker kills his accomplices and "saves" Sean. The other day, Tom is out there with his wife and son. He goes back to their apartment to quickly pick up something when Shaker shows up to collect the bounty. Sean and Kate arrive soon after Tom, and Sean recognizes Shaker as the kidnappers' leader. Shaker becomes totally gullible after that. He first easily reveals his true identity and holds Tom at gunpoint. They drive to the bank to transfer the money. On the way, Shaker makes another ridiculous mistake when he forces Tom to call the airport so he can book a private flight. Of course, Tom calls the FBI, and the police are soon informed to arrest Shaker. Upon leaving the bank, Shaker kills a couple of cops and the final showdown with Tom ensues. The showdown was quite boring, and I was just waiting for the movie to end as soon as possible.

    The premise of this movie is that a father becomes convinced that the kidnappers of his son will kill his boy even if he pays up; in his desperation he goes rogue, offering money for anyone who helps find the abductors instead... ... which might seem like a good idea on screen, but is a horrible one if you have the slightest demand for realism. It was quite ridiculous to watch the ruthless kidnapper-boss getting himself all pumped up over Mel's strategy. In real life Mel would have probably received an envelope with his son's fingers each day he wasn't paying. I mean come on- there are plenty of things one can do short of killing that would have made anyone in the world pay in half an hour. So yeah, the acting was good, the action OK, the movie as a whole entertaining, but it's hard to give it a good mark if its core idea doesn't work.

    I found this movie to be a complete garbage, like most of the movies starring (or directed) by Mel Gibson. (I think that "The Passion of the Christ" might be one of the very few notorious exceptions) This movie is pathetic and boring. It lacked an interesting, likable characters or any kind of redeeming value. There simply wasn't anything good about this atrocious film. It was a terrible film, and it was the worst Ron Howard movie, along with his "Da Vinci Code" film (A terrible adaptation of an equally terrible book) and the dreadful "Angels & Demons". If you want to see a good movie directed by Ron Howard see "Cinderella Man" or "Apollo 13" and skip this nonsense.

    Yes, I enjoyed watching this movie - even though it felt at times that it would never end. It looks like there are enough reviews on here praising its technical "merits" by Hollywood criteria. I for one do not think the acting had much quality or depth to it at all (Gibson's is really inconsistent/ delirious), nor would I say at all that this is a "good" film story, just an enjoyable one, and a compelling one for the following reason; This is possibly the most thinly-veiled cinematic propagation of a Neoliberal capitalist mentality I have seen - from the mid-nineties: White collar criminal (Gibson) gains his redemption / dignity and the respect of his family and government (the skeptical FBI agent (Lindo)) by pursuing a stubborn, risky path of non-negotiation (which jeopardizes the life of his son). Gibson's character refuses to pay-off the "human garbage" who could partially be seen to represent an extralegal justice.. and effectively pits the actors who constitute the threat to his decadent life against one another; the competition literally destroys itself -for the most part. The final scene is the most unbelievable, where we see the corporate 'hero' disobey the faithful but ineffective state - the officers demanding that he "drop the gun", who failed to take down the wayward dissatisfied officer from their ranks. A sort of case for the benefits of extreme self-interest, privatization, deregulation of business, realpolitik, etc.? This is an interesting watch as it significantly predates the wall street crash, the more contemporary political-economic policy that one would associate with this sort of message, and the more recent flashier action films (i.e. Nolan's Dark Knight, Miller's 300 etc) that are recognizable now as the Hollywood promotion of (I would say quite TOXIC) Neoliberalism. Thanks for reading.

    I watched this movie first when it came out and I was only about 11 years old or so. So I decided to give it a watch nearly ten years later and I loved it even more. Its not a very original idea and it has been done before but the writing and the great performance by Mel Gibson make this far superior to most of the movies with this subject. This movie is about a well off boss of an airline who while at the park with his family one day has his son kidnapped. The kidnappers ask for a two million dollars ransom. The father is going to pay without any questions until he starts thinking that once he pays they will kill his son so he comes up with a back up plan. This is a really good thriller and another great movie from Gibson. I have always been a Gibson fan and I only wish he made more movies these days.

    Ron Howard and Mel Gibson have a thing in common. Unreliability of excellence. Both have done exceptional work, but some of it not so. This is ironically a meeting of those inconsistencies in a movie that is not the best or the worst of either. The blending of the two talented, if spotty, mega-stars ends up being a glaring case of highlighted mediocrity not superiority. The overacting and totally unbelievable Gibson uses many mannerisms of his earlier films and seems unable to play any emotion except righteous indignation, and that he does well. But here he is called upon to emote and react with heartfelt feelings that come off as hammy and borderline horrendous. His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police. The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing. The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.

    ***SPOILERS*** Mel Gibson as Endeavor Airline President Tom Mullen is put on the spot when his 12 year old son Sean,Brawley Nolte,is kidnapped by a gang of hoods lead one of New York's Finest hero cop Let. Jimmy Shaker, Gary Sinise. It's in him feeling low paid, like getting $80,000.00 plus a year isn't enough for him!, and him being a disrespected member of the working class cop Shaker had all his life developed a deep seeded hatred of anyone with money. And he sees Mullen and his family as perfect targets for his insane paranoia against the rich and famous which he considers Tom Mullen to be member of. As it later turns out the two million dollars in ransom money he want's for Sean safe return is just a cover in what Shaker really wanted in having it both ways: Getting the money and at the same time killing the innocent Sean to satisfy his both blood and money lust! It take's a while for Tom to figure out just what a low-life piece of you know what Shanker really is, far lower then his lame brain accomplices,and decides to play a game of chicken with him against the advice of his wife Kate, Rene Russo, and the FBI Agent in charge of the kidnap case Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Delroy Lindo. Going on TV to make an announcement to his son's kidnappers Tom instead of paying up tell the shocked and at the same time confused hoods that the 2 million he's got in ransom money is now a bounty on their heads for anyone who can track them down and bring them to justice! That's unless they return Sean safely and unharmed to him and Kate. With the heat now on the kidnappers they start to unravel and it's hero cop Shanker who's the first to jump ship! Not in turning himself in and releasing Sean but gunning down in cold blood his cohorts and making it look like he save Sean from his kidnappers! In the process of his "heroic action" Shanker is shot and wounded by his fellow kidnapper and lover Maris Connor,Lili Taylor, who in return Shaker blasts to kingdom come. ***SPOILERS*** Now things really start getting interesting with Shanker wanting to collect his hard earned 4 million, Tom had since doubled the bounty price, that he murdered some half dozen people for and jumps the gun by showing up at Tom's fifth Ave penthouse to collect. That instead of waiting a few day for the hero of the years ceremony at City Hall where he's to be given the four million dollar check by both Tom and the Mayor of the City of New York! Slasher like ending with both Tom and Shaker having it out at the bank where he's,Tom, to deposit the four million dollar check into an off shore account in Shanker's name. Tom had gotten the lowdown to who Shaker really is, Sean's kidnapper, by seeing Sean wetting his pants when he heard his voice, at the Mullen penthouse, the same voice he heard when he was held kidnapped and blindfold by Shaker and his gang. This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!

It take's a while for Tom to figure out just what a low-life piece of you know what Shanker really is, far lower then his lame brain accomplices,and decides to play a game of chicken with him against the advice of his wife Kate, Rene Russo, and the FBI Agent in charge of the kidnap case Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Delroy Lindo. Going on TV to make an announcement to his son's kidnappers Tom instead of paying up tell the shocked and at the same time confused hoods that the 2 million he's got in ransom money is now a bounty on their heads for anyone who can track them down and bring them to justice! That's unless they return Sean safely and unharmed to him and Kate. With the heat now on the kidnappers they start to unravel and it's hero cop Shanker who's the first to jump ship! Not in turning himself in and releasing Sean but gunning down in cold blood his cohorts and making it look like he save Sean from his kidnappers! In the process of his "heroic action" Shanker is shot and wounded by his fellow kidnapper and lover Maris Connor,Lili Taylor, who in return Shaker blasts to kingdom come. ***SPOILERS*** Now things really start getting interesting with Shanker wanting to collect his hard earned 4 million, Tom had since doubled the bounty price, that he murdered some half dozen people for and jumps the gun by showing up at Tom's fifth Ave penthouse to collect. That instead of waiting a few day for the hero of the years ceremony at City Hall where he's to be given the four million dollar check by both Tom and the Mayor of the City of New York! Slasher like ending with both Tom and Shaker having it out at the bank where he's,Tom, to deposit the four million dollar check into an off shore account in Shanker's name. Tom had gotten the lowdown to who Shaker really is, Sean's kidnapper, by seeing Sean wetting his pants when he heard his voice, at the Mullen penthouse, the same voice he heard when he was held kidnapped and blindfold by Shaker and his gang. This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!

    Mel Gibson, Rene Russo and Gary Sinise star in Ron Howard's 1996 thriller. A millionaire threatens the kidnappers who abducted his son. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is a millionaire in charge of an airline. He has a wife, Kate (Russo) and son, Sean (Brawley Nolte). Sean becomes kidnapped by a ruthless cop, Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) who wants money from Tom. Tom and Kate are secretly helped by the F.B.I with the investigation. When Tom gets a ransom from the kidnappers, he threatens them by putting the money as a bounty on them and is determined to get Sean back no matter what the cost. Delroy Lindo, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg co-star. This is a great thriller and Gary is a good villain. I recommend this.

    A loose remake of the film of the same name, Ron Howard's 'Ransom' is A Brilliant Film! An edgy, violent & captivating thriller. Also, Mel Gibson is Excellent! 'Ransom' Synopsis: When a rich man's son is kidnapped, he cooperates with the police at first but then tries a unique tactic against the criminals. 'Ransom' is edgy, violent, challenging & captivating. A Thriller that has it all. It arrested Me from Scene A to Z. Richard Price & Alexander Ignon's Screenplay is top-notch! Ron Howard's Direction, Like Always, is interesting. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Art & Costume Design are fair. Performance-Wise: As mentioned before, Mel Gibson is Excellent! The Legendary Actor delivers one of his finest performances ever. Gary Sinise plays the villain, most convincingly, essaying his part with ease & venom. Rene Russo is flawless. Brawley Nolte does very well. Delroy Lindo leaves a terrific impact. On the whole, 'Ransom' is a knock-out! Two Thumbs Up!

    This film had ONE good idea, which was revealed, with much fanfare, about halfway through. Unfortunately it was also revealed in the trailers. Even a ten-second TV ad, which had no time to tell us anything else, told us the one thing that ought to have been kept secret. It must be said that this wasn't the movie's fault; but if knowing the central conceit in advance makes it pointless to actually watch the movie, that IS the movie's fault. I knew what the surprise in 'Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to 'Psycho' than just one idea. Anyway: 'Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.

    Ransom is not really a bad movie, but it's nothing special, either. Its plot is somewhat believable, yet quite predictable as well as full of clich&eacute;s and improbable decisions. The performances are solid, although Mel Gibson does overact on a few occasions in the title role of an airline tycoon named Tom Mullen. Gary Sinise is very good as the main villain, a dirty detective named Jimmy Shaker. However, his character is revealed as the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Mullen's son very early in the movie, which completely ruins the possibility of a good plot twist. The whole kidnapping scene was quite unlikely. Tom attends a science fair with his wife Kate and their son Sean. They seem to attend the fair without any bodyguards despite the fact that Tom not only owns a successful airline, but is also investigated by the FBI for allegedly bribing a union official. He was also way too careless when he lets Sean play in the crowd right before he gets kidnapped. There's a lot of very well-known plot elements throughout the movie. When the kidnappers call the Mullens for the first time, they ask them not to involve the police. Of course, they do not follow the instructions and call the FBI, whose team soon secretly arrives at their New York penthouse. While talking to the team leader, Tom also admits that he had indeed bribed the union official. Of course, he is not arrested at the end of the movie. There is also a failed drop-off sequence, after which the kidnapping becomes public. Tom then appears on TV, turning the 2-million-dollar ransom into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. He also soon increases the amount to 4 million. After that, the movie becomes fairly predictable. Shaker kills his accomplices and "saves" Sean. The other day, Tom is out there with his wife and son. He goes back to their apartment to quickly pick up something when Shaker shows up to collect the bounty. Sean and Kate arrive soon after Tom, and Sean recognizes Shaker as the kidnappers' leader. Shaker becomes totally gullible after that. He first easily reveals his true identity and holds Tom at gunpoint. They drive to the bank to transfer the money. On the way, Shaker makes another ridiculous mistake when he forces Tom to call the airport so he can book a private flight. Of course, Tom calls the FBI, and the police are soon informed to arrest Shaker. Upon leaving the bank, Shaker kills a couple of cops and the final showdown with Tom ensues. The showdown was quite boring, and I was just waiting for the movie to end as soon as possible.

    The premise of this movie is that a father becomes convinced that the kidnappers of his son will kill his boy even if he pays up; in his desperation he goes rogue, offering money for anyone who helps find the abductors instead... ... which might seem like a good idea on screen, but is a horrible one if you have the slightest demand for realism. It was quite ridiculous to watch the ruthless kidnapper-boss getting himself all pumped up over Mel's strategy. In real life Mel would have probably received an envelope with his son's fingers each day he wasn't paying. I mean come on- there are plenty of things one can do short of killing that would have made anyone in the world pay in half an hour. So yeah, the acting was good, the action OK, the movie as a whole entertaining, but it's hard to give it a good mark if its core idea doesn't work.

    I found this movie to be a complete garbage, like most of the movies starring (or directed) by Mel Gibson. (I think that "The Passion of the Christ" might be one of the very few notorious exceptions) This movie is pathetic and boring. It lacked an interesting, likable characters or any kind of redeeming value. There simply wasn't anything good about this atrocious film. It was a terrible film, and it was the worst Ron Howard movie, along with his "Da Vinci Code" film (A terrible adaptation of an equally terrible book) and the dreadful "Angels & Demons". If you want to see a good movie directed by Ron Howard see "Cinderella Man" or "Apollo 13" and skip this nonsense.

    Yes, I enjoyed watching this movie - even though it felt at times that it would never end. It looks like there are enough reviews on here praising its technical "merits" by Hollywood criteria. I for one do not think the acting had much quality or depth to it at all (Gibson's is really inconsistent/ delirious), nor would I say at all that this is a "good" film story, just an enjoyable one, and a compelling one for the following reason; This is possibly the most thinly-veiled cinematic propagation of a Neoliberal capitalist mentality I have seen - from the mid-nineties: White collar criminal (Gibson) gains his redemption / dignity and the respect of his family and government (the skeptical FBI agent (Lindo)) by pursuing a stubborn, risky path of non-negotiation (which jeopardizes the life of his son). Gibson's character refuses to pay-off the "human garbage" who could partially be seen to represent an extralegal justice.. and effectively pits the actors who constitute the threat to his decadent life against one another; the competition literally destroys itself -for the most part. The final scene is the most unbelievable, where we see the corporate 'hero' disobey the faithful but ineffective state - the officers demanding that he "drop the gun", who failed to take down the wayward dissatisfied officer from their ranks. A sort of case for the benefits of extreme self-interest, privatization, deregulation of business, realpolitik, etc.? This is an interesting watch as it significantly predates the wall street crash, the more contemporary political-economic policy that one would associate with this sort of message, and the more recent flashier action films (i.e. Nolan's Dark Knight, Miller's 300 etc) that are recognizable now as the Hollywood promotion of (I would say quite TOXIC) Neoliberalism. Thanks for reading.

    I watched this movie first when it came out and I was only about 11 years old or so. So I decided to give it a watch nearly ten years later and I loved it even more. Its not a very original idea and it has been done before but the writing and the great performance by Mel Gibson make this far superior to most of the movies with this subject. This movie is about a well off boss of an airline who while at the park with his family one day has his son kidnapped. The kidnappers ask for a two million dollars ransom. The father is going to pay without any questions until he starts thinking that once he pays they will kill his son so he comes up with a back up plan. This is a really good thriller and another great movie from Gibson. I have always been a Gibson fan and I only wish he made more movies these days.

    Ron Howard and Mel Gibson have a thing in common. Unreliability of excellence. Both have done exceptional work, but some of it not so. This is ironically a meeting of those inconsistencies in a movie that is not the best or the worst of either. The blending of the two talented, if spotty, mega-stars ends up being a glaring case of highlighted mediocrity not superiority. The overacting and totally unbelievable Gibson uses many mannerisms of his earlier films and seems unable to play any emotion except righteous indignation, and that he does well. But here he is called upon to emote and react with heartfelt feelings that come off as hammy and borderline horrendous. His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police. The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing. The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.

    ***SPOILERS*** Mel Gibson as Endeavor Airline President Tom Mullen is put on the spot when his 12 year old son Sean,Brawley Nolte,is kidnapped by a gang of hoods lead one of New York's Finest hero cop Let. Jimmy Shaker, Gary Sinise. It's in him feeling low paid, like getting $80,000.00 plus a year isn't enough for him!, and him being a disrespected member of the working class cop Shaker had all his life developed a deep seeded hatred of anyone with money. And he sees Mullen and his family as perfect targets for his insane paranoia against the rich and famous which he considers Tom Mullen to be member of. As it later turns out the two million dollars in ransom money he want's for Sean safe return is just a cover in what Shaker really wanted in having it both ways: Getting the money and at the same time killing the innocent Sean to satisfy his both blood and money lust! It take's a while for Tom to figure out just what a low-life piece of you know what Shanker really is, far lower then his lame brain accomplices,and decides to play a game of chicken with him against the advice of his wife Kate, Rene Russo, and the FBI Agent in charge of the kidnap case Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Delroy Lindo. Going on TV to make an announcement to his son's kidnappers Tom instead of paying up tell the shocked and at the same time confused hoods that the 2 million he's got in ransom money is now a bounty on their heads for anyone who can track them down and bring them to justice! That's unless they return Sean safely and unharmed to him and Kate. With the heat now on the kidnappers they start to unravel and it's hero cop Shanker who's the first to jump ship! Not in turning himself in and releasing Sean but gunning down in cold blood his cohorts and making it look like he save Sean from his kidnappers! In the process of his "heroic action" Shanker is shot and wounded by his fellow kidnapper and lover Maris Connor,Lili Taylor, who in return Shaker blasts to kingdom come. ***SPOILERS*** Now things really start getting interesting with Shanker wanting to collect his hard earned 4 million, Tom had since doubled the bounty price, that he murdered some half dozen people for and jumps the gun by showing up at Tom's fifth Ave penthouse to collect.

Tom had gotten the lowdown to who Shaker really is, Sean's kidnapper, by seeing Sean wetting his pants when he heard his voice, at the Mullen penthouse, the same voice he heard when he was held kidnapped and blindfold by Shaker and his gang. This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!

    Ron Howard and Mel Gibson have a thing in common. Unreliability of excellence. Both have done exceptional work, but some of it not so. This is ironically a meeting of those inconsistencies in a movie that is not the best or the worst of either. The blending of the two talented, if spotty, mega-stars ends up being a glaring case of highlighted mediocrity not superiority. The overacting and totally unbelievable Gibson uses many mannerisms of his earlier films and seems unable to play any emotion except righteous indignation, and that he does well. But here he is called upon to emote and react with heartfelt feelings that come off as hammy and borderline horrendous. His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police. The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing. The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.

    ***SPOILERS*** Mel Gibson as Endeavor Airline President Tom Mullen is put on the spot when his 12 year old son Sean,Brawley Nolte,is kidnapped by a gang of hoods lead one of New York's Finest hero cop Let. Jimmy Shaker, Gary Sinise. It's in him feeling low paid, like getting $80,000.00 plus a year isn't enough for him!, and him being a disrespected member of the working class cop Shaker had all his life developed a deep seeded hatred of anyone with money. And he sees Mullen and his family as perfect targets for his insane paranoia against the rich and famous which he considers Tom Mullen to be member of. As it later turns out the two million dollars in ransom money he want's for Sean safe return is just a cover in what Shaker really wanted in having it both ways: Getting the money and at the same time killing the innocent Sean to satisfy his both blood and money lust! It take's a while for Tom to figure out just what a low-life piece of you know what Shanker really is, far lower then his lame brain accomplices,and decides to play a game of chicken with him against the advice of his wife Kate, Rene Russo, and the FBI Agent in charge of the kidnap case Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Delroy Lindo. Going on TV to make an announcement to his son's kidnappers Tom instead of paying up tell the shocked and at the same time confused hoods that the 2 million he's got in ransom money is now a bounty on their heads for anyone who can track them down and bring them to justice! That's unless they return Sean safely and unharmed to him and Kate. With the heat now on the kidnappers they start to unravel and it's hero cop Shanker who's the first to jump ship! Not in turning himself in and releasing Sean but gunning down in cold blood his cohorts and making it look like he save Sean from his kidnappers! In the process of his "heroic action" Shanker is shot and wounded by his fellow kidnapper and lover Maris Connor,Lili Taylor, who in return Shaker blasts to kingdom come. ***SPOILERS*** Now things really start getting interesting with Shanker wanting to collect his hard earned 4 million, Tom had since doubled the bounty price, that he murdered some half dozen people for and jumps the gun by showing up at Tom's fifth Ave penthouse to collect. That instead of waiting a few day for the hero of the years ceremony at City Hall where he's to be given the four million dollar check by both Tom and the Mayor of the City of New York! Slasher like ending with both Tom and Shaker having it out at the bank where he's,Tom, to deposit the four million dollar check into an off shore account in Shanker's name. Tom had gotten the lowdown to who Shaker really is, Sean's kidnapper, by seeing Sean wetting his pants when he heard his voice, at the Mullen penthouse, the same voice he heard when he was held kidnapped and blindfold by Shaker and his gang. This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!

    Mel Gibson, Rene Russo and Gary Sinise star in Ron Howard's 1996 thriller. A millionaire threatens the kidnappers who abducted his son. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is a millionaire in charge of an airline. He has a wife, Kate (Russo) and son, Sean (Brawley Nolte). Sean becomes kidnapped by a ruthless cop, Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) who wants money from Tom. Tom and Kate are secretly helped by the F.B.I with the investigation. When Tom gets a ransom from the kidnappers, he threatens them by putting the money as a bounty on them and is determined to get Sean back no matter what the cost. Delroy Lindo, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg co-star. This is a great thriller and Gary is a good villain. I recommend this.

    A loose remake of the film of the same name, Ron Howard's 'Ransom' is A Brilliant Film! An edgy, violent & captivating thriller. Also, Mel Gibson is Excellent! 'Ransom' Synopsis: When a rich man's son is kidnapped, he cooperates with the police at first but then tries a unique tactic against the criminals. 'Ransom' is edgy, violent, challenging & captivating. A Thriller that has it all. It arrested Me from Scene A to Z. Richard Price & Alexander Ignon's Screenplay is top-notch! Ron Howard's Direction, Like Always, is interesting. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Art & Costume Design are fair. Performance-Wise: As mentioned before, Mel Gibson is Excellent! The Legendary Actor delivers one of his finest performances ever. Gary Sinise plays the villain, most convincingly, essaying his part with ease & venom. Rene Russo is flawless. Brawley Nolte does very well. Delroy Lindo leaves a terrific impact. On the whole, 'Ransom' is a knock-out! Two Thumbs Up!

    This film had ONE good idea, which was revealed, with much fanfare, about halfway through. Unfortunately it was also revealed in the trailers. Even a ten-second TV ad, which had no time to tell us anything else, told us the one thing that ought to have been kept secret. It must be said that this wasn't the movie's fault; but if knowing the central conceit in advance makes it pointless to actually watch the movie, that IS the movie's fault. I knew what the surprise in 'Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to 'Psycho' than just one idea. Anyway: 'Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.

    Ransom is not really a bad movie, but it's nothing special, either. Its plot is somewhat believable, yet quite predictable as well as full of clich&eacute;s and improbable decisions. The performances are solid, although Mel Gibson does overact on a few occasions in the title role of an airline tycoon named Tom Mullen. Gary Sinise is very good as the main villain, a dirty detective named Jimmy Shaker. However, his character is revealed as the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Mullen's son very early in the movie, which completely ruins the possibility of a good plot twist. The whole kidnapping scene was quite unlikely. Tom attends a science fair with his wife Kate and their son Sean. They seem to attend the fair without any bodyguards despite the fact that Tom not only owns a successful airline, but is also investigated by the FBI for allegedly bribing a union official. He was also way too careless when he lets Sean play in the crowd right before he gets kidnapped. There's a lot of very well-known plot elements throughout the movie. When the kidnappers call the Mullens for the first time, they ask them not to involve the police. Of course, they do not follow the instructions and call the FBI, whose team soon secretly arrives at their New York penthouse. While talking to the team leader, Tom also admits that he had indeed bribed the union official. Of course, he is not arrested at the end of the movie. There is also a failed drop-off sequence, after which the kidnapping becomes public. Tom then appears on TV, turning the 2-million-dollar ransom into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. He also soon increases the amount to 4 million. After that, the movie becomes fairly predictable. Shaker kills his accomplices and "saves" Sean. The other day, Tom is out there with his wife and son. He goes back to their apartment to quickly pick up something when Shaker shows up to collect the bounty. Sean and Kate arrive soon after Tom, and Sean recognizes Shaker as the kidnappers' leader. Shaker becomes totally gullible after that. He first easily reveals his true identity and holds Tom at gunpoint. They drive to the bank to transfer the money. On the way, Shaker makes another ridiculous mistake when he forces Tom to call the airport so he can book a private flight. Of course, Tom calls the FBI, and the police are soon informed to arrest Shaker. Upon leaving the bank, Shaker kills a couple of cops and the final showdown with Tom ensues. The showdown was quite boring, and I was just waiting for the movie to end as soon as possible.

    The premise of this movie is that a father becomes convinced that the kidnappers of his son will kill his boy even if he pays up; in his desperation he goes rogue, offering money for anyone who helps find the abductors instead... ... which might seem like a good idea on screen, but is a horrible one if you have the slightest demand for realism. It was quite ridiculous to watch the ruthless kidnapper-boss getting himself all pumped up over Mel's strategy. In real life Mel would have probably received an envelope with his son's fingers each day he wasn't paying. I mean come on- there are plenty of things one can do short of killing that would have made anyone in the world pay in half an hour. So yeah, the acting was good, the action OK, the movie as a whole entertaining, but it's hard to give it a good mark if its core idea doesn't work.

    I found this movie to be a complete garbage, like most of the movies starring (or directed) by Mel Gibson. (I think that "The Passion of the Christ" might be one of the very few notorious exceptions) This movie is pathetic and boring. It lacked an interesting, likable characters or any kind of redeeming value. There simply wasn't anything good about this atrocious film. It was a terrible film, and it was the worst Ron Howard movie, along with his "Da Vinci Code" film (A terrible adaptation of an equally terrible book) and the dreadful "Angels & Demons". If you want to see a good movie directed by Ron Howard see "Cinderella Man" or "Apollo 13" and skip this nonsense.

    Yes, I enjoyed watching this movie - even though it felt at times that it would never end. It looks like there are enough reviews on here praising its technical "merits" by Hollywood criteria. I for one do not think the acting had much quality or depth to it at all (Gibson's is really inconsistent/ delirious), nor would I say at all that this is a "good" film story, just an enjoyable one, and a compelling one for the following reason; This is possibly the most thinly-veiled cinematic propagation of a Neoliberal capitalist mentality I have seen - from the mid-nineties: White collar criminal (Gibson) gains his redemption / dignity and the respect of his family and government (the skeptical FBI agent (Lindo)) by pursuing a stubborn, risky path of non-negotiation (which jeopardizes the life of his son). Gibson's character refuses to pay-off the "human garbage" who could partially be seen to represent an extralegal justice.. and effectively pits the actors who constitute the threat to his decadent life against one another; the competition literally destroys itself -for the most part. The final scene is the most unbelievable, where we see the corporate 'hero' disobey the faithful but ineffective state - the officers demanding that he "drop the gun", who failed to take down the wayward dissatisfied officer from their ranks. A sort of case for the benefits of extreme self-interest, privatization, deregulation of business, realpolitik, etc.? This is an interesting watch as it significantly predates the wall street crash, the more contemporary political-economic policy that one would associate with this sort of message, and the more recent flashier action films (i.e. Nolan's Dark Knight, Miller's 300 etc) that are recognizable now as the Hollywood promotion of (I would say quite TOXIC) Neoliberalism. Thanks for reading.

    I watched this movie first when it came out and I was only about 11 years old or so. So I decided to give it a watch nearly ten years later and I loved it even more. Its not a very original idea and it has been done before but the writing and the great performance by Mel Gibson make this far superior to most of the movies with this subject. This movie is about a well off boss of an airline who while at the park with his family one day has his son kidnapped. The kidnappers ask for a two million dollars ransom. The father is going to pay without any questions until he starts thinking that once he pays they will kill his son so he comes up with a back up plan. This is a really good thriller and another great movie from Gibson. I have always been a Gibson fan and I only wish he made more movies these days.

    Ron Howard and Mel Gibson have a thing in common. Unreliability of excellence. Both have done exceptional work, but some of it not so. This is ironically a meeting of those inconsistencies in a movie that is not the best or the worst of either. The blending of the two talented, if spotty, mega-stars ends up being a glaring case of highlighted mediocrity not superiority. The overacting and totally unbelievable Gibson uses many mannerisms of his earlier films and seems unable to play any emotion except righteous indignation, and that he does well. But here he is called upon to emote and react with heartfelt feelings that come off as hammy and borderline horrendous. His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police. The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing. The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.

I for one do not think the acting had much quality or depth to it at all (Gibson's is really inconsistent/ delirious), nor would I say at all that this is a "good" film story, just an enjoyable one, and a compelling one for the following reason; This is possibly the most thinly-veiled cinematic propagation of a Neoliberal capitalist mentality I have seen - from the mid-nineties: White collar criminal (Gibson) gains his redemption / dignity and the respect of his family and government (the skeptical FBI agent (Lindo)) by pursuing a stubborn, risky path of non-negotiation (which jeopardizes the life of his son). Gibson's character refuses to pay-off the "human garbage" who could partially be seen to represent an extralegal justice.. and effectively pits the actors who constitute the threat to his decadent life against one another; the competition literally destroys itself -for the most part. The final scene is the most unbelievable, where we see the corporate 'hero' disobey the faithful but ineffective state - the officers demanding that he "drop the gun", who failed to take down the wayward dissatisfied officer from their ranks. A sort of case for the benefits of extreme self-interest, privatization, deregulation of business, realpolitik, etc.? This is an interesting watch as it significantly predates the wall street crash, the more contemporary political-economic policy that one would associate with this sort of message, and the more recent flashier action films (i.e. Nolan's Dark Knight, Miller's 300 etc) that are recognizable now as the Hollywood promotion of (I would say quite TOXIC) Neoliberalism. Thanks for reading.

    I watched this movie first when it came out and I was only about 11 years old or so. So I decided to give it a watch nearly ten years later and I loved it even more. Its not a very original idea and it has been done before but the writing and the great performance by Mel Gibson make this far superior to most of the movies with this subject. This movie is about a well off boss of an airline who while at the park with his family one day has his son kidnapped. The kidnappers ask for a two million dollars ransom. The father is going to pay without any questions until he starts thinking that once he pays they will kill his son so he comes up with a back up plan. This is a really good thriller and another great movie from Gibson. I have always been a Gibson fan and I only wish he made more movies these days.

    Ron Howard and Mel Gibson have a thing in common. Unreliability of excellence. Both have done exceptional work, but some of it not so. This is ironically a meeting of those inconsistencies in a movie that is not the best or the worst of either. The blending of the two talented, if spotty, mega-stars ends up being a glaring case of highlighted mediocrity not superiority. The overacting and totally unbelievable Gibson uses many mannerisms of his earlier films and seems unable to play any emotion except righteous indignation, and that he does well. But here he is called upon to emote and react with heartfelt feelings that come off as hammy and borderline horrendous. His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police. The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing. The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.

    ***SPOILERS*** Mel Gibson as Endeavor Airline President Tom Mullen is put on the spot when his 12 year old son Sean,Brawley Nolte,is kidnapped by a gang of hoods lead one of New York's Finest hero cop Let. Jimmy Shaker, Gary Sinise. It's in him feeling low paid, like getting $80,000.00 plus a year isn't enough for him!, and him being a disrespected member of the working class cop Shaker had all his life developed a deep seeded hatred of anyone with money. And he sees Mullen and his family as perfect targets for his insane paranoia against the rich and famous which he considers Tom Mullen to be member of. As it later turns out the two million dollars in ransom money he want's for Sean safe return is just a cover in what Shaker really wanted in having it both ways: Getting the money and at the same time killing the innocent Sean to satisfy his both blood and money lust! It take's a while for Tom to figure out just what a low-life piece of you know what Shanker really is, far lower then his lame brain accomplices,and decides to play a game of chicken with him against the advice of his wife Kate, Rene Russo, and the FBI Agent in charge of the kidnap case Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Delroy Lindo. Going on TV to make an announcement to his son's kidnappers Tom instead of paying up tell the shocked and at the same time confused hoods that the 2 million he's got in ransom money is now a bounty on their heads for anyone who can track them down and bring them to justice! That's unless they return Sean safely and unharmed to him and Kate. With the heat now on the kidnappers they start to unravel and it's hero cop Shanker who's the first to jump ship! Not in turning himself in and releasing Sean but gunning down in cold blood his cohorts and making it look like he save Sean from his kidnappers! In the process of his "heroic action" Shanker is shot and wounded by his fellow kidnapper and lover Maris Connor,Lili Taylor, who in return Shaker blasts to kingdom come. ***SPOILERS*** Now things really start getting interesting with Shanker wanting to collect his hard earned 4 million, Tom had since doubled the bounty price, that he murdered some half dozen people for and jumps the gun by showing up at Tom's fifth Ave penthouse to collect. That instead of waiting a few day for the hero of the years ceremony at City Hall where he's to be given the four million dollar check by both Tom and the Mayor of the City of New York! Slasher like ending with both Tom and Shaker having it out at the bank where he's,Tom, to deposit the four million dollar check into an off shore account in Shanker's name. Tom had gotten the lowdown to who Shaker really is, Sean's kidnapper, by seeing Sean wetting his pants when he heard his voice, at the Mullen penthouse, the same voice he heard when he was held kidnapped and blindfold by Shaker and his gang. This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!

    Mel Gibson, Rene Russo and Gary Sinise star in Ron Howard's 1996 thriller. A millionaire threatens the kidnappers who abducted his son. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is a millionaire in charge of an airline. He has a wife, Kate (Russo) and son, Sean (Brawley Nolte). Sean becomes kidnapped by a ruthless cop, Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) who wants money from Tom. Tom and Kate are secretly helped by the F.B.I with the investigation. When Tom gets a ransom from the kidnappers, he threatens them by putting the money as a bounty on them and is determined to get Sean back no matter what the cost. Delroy Lindo, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg co-star. This is a great thriller and Gary is a good villain. I recommend this.

    A loose remake of the film of the same name, Ron Howard's 'Ransom' is A Brilliant Film! An edgy, violent & captivating thriller. Also, Mel Gibson is Excellent! 'Ransom' Synopsis: When a rich man's son is kidnapped, he cooperates with the police at first but then tries a unique tactic against the criminals. 'Ransom' is edgy, violent, challenging & captivating. A Thriller that has it all. It arrested Me from Scene A to Z. Richard Price & Alexander Ignon's Screenplay is top-notch! Ron Howard's Direction, Like Always, is interesting. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Art & Costume Design are fair. Performance-Wise: As mentioned before, Mel Gibson is Excellent! The Legendary Actor delivers one of his finest performances ever. Gary Sinise plays the villain, most convincingly, essaying his part with ease & venom. Rene Russo is flawless. Brawley Nolte does very well. Delroy Lindo leaves a terrific impact. On the whole, 'Ransom' is a knock-out! Two Thumbs Up!

    This film had ONE good idea, which was revealed, with much fanfare, about halfway through. Unfortunately it was also revealed in the trailers. Even a ten-second TV ad, which had no time to tell us anything else, told us the one thing that ought to have been kept secret. It must be said that this wasn't the movie's fault; but if knowing the central conceit in advance makes it pointless to actually watch the movie, that IS the movie's fault. I knew what the surprise in 'Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to 'Psycho' than just one idea. Anyway: 'Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.

    Ransom is not really a bad movie, but it's nothing special, either. Its plot is somewhat believable, yet quite predictable as well as full of clich&eacute;s and improbable decisions. The performances are solid, although Mel Gibson does overact on a few occasions in the title role of an airline tycoon named Tom Mullen. Gary Sinise is very good as the main villain, a dirty detective named Jimmy Shaker. However, his character is revealed as the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Mullen's son very early in the movie, which completely ruins the possibility of a good plot twist. The whole kidnapping scene was quite unlikely. Tom attends a science fair with his wife Kate and their son Sean. They seem to attend the fair without any bodyguards despite the fact that Tom not only owns a successful airline, but is also investigated by the FBI for allegedly bribing a union official. He was also way too careless when he lets Sean play in the crowd right before he gets kidnapped. There's a lot of very well-known plot elements throughout the movie. When the kidnappers call the Mullens for the first time, they ask them not to involve the police. Of course, they do not follow the instructions and call the FBI, whose team soon secretly arrives at their New York penthouse. While talking to the team leader, Tom also admits that he had indeed bribed the union official. Of course, he is not arrested at the end of the movie. There is also a failed drop-off sequence, after which the kidnapping becomes public. Tom then appears on TV, turning the 2-million-dollar ransom into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. He also soon increases the amount to 4 million. After that, the movie becomes fairly predictable. Shaker kills his accomplices and "saves" Sean. The other day, Tom is out there with his wife and son. He goes back to their apartment to quickly pick up something when Shaker shows up to collect the bounty. Sean and Kate arrive soon after Tom, and Sean recognizes Shaker as the kidnappers' leader. Shaker becomes totally gullible after that. He first easily reveals his true identity and holds Tom at gunpoint. They drive to the bank to transfer the money. On the way, Shaker makes another ridiculous mistake when he forces Tom to call the airport so he can book a private flight. Of course, Tom calls the FBI, and the police are soon informed to arrest Shaker. Upon leaving the bank, Shaker kills a couple of cops and the final showdown with Tom ensues. The showdown was quite boring, and I was just waiting for the movie to end as soon as possible.

    The premise of this movie is that a father becomes convinced that the kidnappers of his son will kill his boy even if he pays up; in his desperation he goes rogue, offering money for anyone who helps find the abductors instead... ... which might seem like a good idea on screen, but is a horrible one if you have the slightest demand for realism. It was quite ridiculous to watch the ruthless kidnapper-boss getting himself all pumped up over Mel's strategy. In real life Mel would have probably received an envelope with his son's fingers each day he wasn't paying. I mean come on- there are plenty of things one can do short of killing that would have made anyone in the world pay in half an hour. So yeah, the acting was good, the action OK, the movie as a whole entertaining, but it's hard to give it a good mark if its core idea doesn't work.
