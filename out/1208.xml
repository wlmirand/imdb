    Kiss of Death is directed by Barbet Schroeder and collectively written by Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer, Eleazar Lipsky and Richard Price. It stars David Caruso, Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Helen Hunt, Ving Rhames, Stanley Tucci, Kathryn Erbe, Michael Rapaport and Anthony Heald. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli. Reformed ex-con Jimmy Kilmartin (Caruso) reluctantly helps out his cousin transporting stolen cars but gets caught and ends up taking the fall for the whole caper. Back in prison and missing his wife and child, Jimmy gets offered a lifeline if he is prepared to go undercover with the police to bring down psychotic crime boss Little Junior Brown (Cage). A loose remake of the excellent 1947 film noir of the same name, Schroeder's Kiss of Death is slightly better than the iffy reputation afforded it. Yes it's more solid than anything resembling truly compelling, but it wears its noir heart on its sleeve and is very well performed by an impressive cast. Caruso's Kilmartin is a classic noir protagonist, a man who tries to go straight but gets dragged into a world of crime and shifty undercover machinations after doing one honest intention favour. From the point he agrees to help out Ronnie Gannon (Rapaport a jumping bean performance), he loses what he holds most dear and continually gets pulled from pillar to post by everyone around him. He's basically a good guy that fate has dealt a deadly hand, even when he gets a second chance at happiness it's not long before the door knocks and he's thrust into a deadly undercover game where he will be lucky to escape with his life intact. A lot has been made of TV star Caruso's unsuccessful attempt at breaking into films, with some believing that his performance here is mostly to blame. Yet in the context of a noir protagonist his performance is perfectly good, in fact it's a very subtle turn that isn't short on brooding intensity. That he is overshadowed by the likes of Cage (wonderfully on full tilt overdrive as a nut-case) and Jackson (calm yet assured presence) is no bad thing, especially since both come with noir infected ticks (Jackson has a continuous weeping eye/Cage has a phobia about metal in his mouth). Caruso does good here, bringing the character to life without histrionics, he helps the audience understand his frustration as he spins in his vortex of disharmony. Nobody is done any favours by a screenplay that doesn't take chances, and at times it comes close to standing still in the mid-section, while the climax is a little underwhelming. But for a piece of pulpy neo-noir it has enough about it to make it worth a look. 6.5/10

    As with any role she assays, Kathryn Erbe creates a character of such depth and meaning that she deservedly receives most of the attention of audiences. Here, she takes an underwritten part and through her compassion, spirituality, and sensuality makes the film her own. Anyone who has watched her on Law and Order: Criminal Intent, OZ, Homicide: Life On the Street on television, or seen the films Dream With the Fishes, 3 Backyards, or especially and most notably Blume In Love, realizes Ms. Erbe is an actor's actor. She is certainly one of the most gifted women working as an actor in any medium. Over the course of Criminal Intent, she was able to keep the character of Eames fresh and real while holding her own with grace as her co-star did everything possible to overshadow her. There was, however, no ignoring Ms. Erbe's presence. The film now being discussed is a weak remake and not very good, simply put. Yet Kathryn Erbe makes her part shine and with a subtle power makes her character outstanding. She deserves an opportunity in better quality films to demonstrate how gifted and talented she is. She has done this time after time on stage and whether in film or on television, audiences are always in for something very special when her name appears in the credits.

    Barbet Schroeder has not had what anyone would call a very fruitful American period. In between the Wilderesque black comedy masterwork REVERSAL OF FORTUNE and the pedestrian MURDER BY NUMBERS came this in-name-only remake of Henry Hathaway's 1947 classic. David Caruso, possessing none of the presence or gravitas it takes to carry a film, stars as a con trying to go straight but is tripped up by his involvement with degenerate gangster Nicolas Cage (as Little Junior Brown -- that name being one of the few clever things in the film). Schroeder directs the film at a brisk clip but it's all for naught; the material is just nothing special. Appearances by Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci (as a self-serving prosecutor), Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Rappaport add very little.

    This loosely-based remake of a 1947 film noir seems to have few followers, even after 17 years. It made no money in theaters and very few people have commented on it here. TV actor David Caruso plays Jimmy, a small-time criminal who gets sent back to the slammer after taking part in a bungled heist. Worse, his wife is killed in a car accident while he's doing time and his young daughter is sent to live with his hostile mother in law. When he gets out, the state and feds just won't leave him alone. They want him to help them nab Junior, played by a pumped-up, almost unrecognizable Nic Cage. Turns out Junior was the mastermind behind the fumbled heist and numerous other crimes. So Caruso's character goes undercover. The film is violent and foul-mouthed, a far cay from the Victor Mature-Richard-Widmark original. The story has been "opened up," as the 1947 version was largely a soundstage production. It's hard to compare the two, so many changes have been made and liberties taken with the 1995 remake. I watched the two films back to back the other night. Both have their merits. Caruso's Jimmy is a lot more spunky than Mature's hero, and Cage's over the top villain is worlds apart from Widmark's sneering, oily bad guy. Cage portrays Junior (called Tommy Udo in the 1947 version) as an over-sized psychopath with some very odd ticks and habits, and he is truly demented and scary. By comparison, Widmark's Udo is almost comical, a Damon Runyonesque gangster who would fit right in in a production of "Guys and Dolls." Plus the remake boasts a stellar supporting cast, including Helen Hunt as Jimmy's ill-fated wife, Stanley Tucci as a two-faced prosecutor, Michael Rappaport as Jimmy's larcenous cousin, Kathryn "Criminal Intent" Erbe as Jimmy's loyal friend and Sam Jackson as a detective who has a bone to pick with Jimmy. See both films. It couldn't hurt.

    I'm going to keep this short for posterity sake if you like thrillers this movie is for you. If you like movies this movie is for you. Not only is the story amazing, that goes without saying, but it's the little subtleties that really make the difference; the directing in terms of the mise en scene present in divine, the lighting throughout is spectacular. All and all the The Kiss of Death is a great film, containing great acting, particularly by Nicolas Cage. Speaking of thrillers and Nic Cage he's got a new one coming out called Trespass that looks pretty cool. Check out the trailer then thank me for changing your life. http://bitly.com/qN22Cm

    I think the best way to approach this movie is on its own terms rather than as a remake of the 1940s film. In any case, it merely follows the general story outline of the earlier picture. What makes it altogether new is Richard Price's screenplay, Barbet Schroeder's direction, a great lineup of actors, and location shooting in some of New York City's seediest and most squalid areas. Along with the great locations, what really provides the atmosphere is Price's writing. Once again he shows his down to the ground knowledge of the characters, mannerisms, and lingo of the creeps and hoodlums in the big city underworld, and the law enforcement people who deal with them. And there is also Price's trademark offbeat humor. While the earlier film gave us Richard Widmark as a really scary psycho, in this later film Richard Price has given us Little Junior Brown, a bulked-up killer with a child's mind and an abiding faith in the nostrums of New Age philosophy. What a delight when Little Junior, fresh from committing murder, asks our hero to take the next day off so they can get together and "talk about life and stuff"! Or when he urges him to settle on an acronym that will give shape to his identity. (Little Junior's is B-A-D--for "Balls, Attitude, Direction.") Nicholas Cage is often accused of playing over the top, but in the case of Little Junior, over the top is the way to go. There are also good performances by Stanley Tucci and Samuel L. Jackson. Tucci excels in portraying charming snakes. When he leers and sneers, it is impossible to keep from watching him. This movie was really very enjoyable.

    It's refreshing to see such old movies now for a change. A young, tough-built Nicolas Cage as a mean gangsta, the pretty Helen Hunt in a 2-minute role as an innocent house wife, a very lean Samuel Jackson as a just cop, and of course David Caruso too. All these actors are huge stars today but if in the mid 90's I were to tell them about their super-stardom future, they might have choked in laughter. About the movie, it's a neat good guy vs the underworld story, very engaging from start to end. The best act was Nicolas Cage's who chills as a baddie. Wish I could have seen more of Helen Hunt though. Verdict: No big shakes but still a cool thriller that's worth watching.

    Here we have ourselves a case of a fairly not wide known director, but not necessarily a bad director. Out of his sleeves we can find 'Desperate Measures', a movie about an autistic child, which was fairly good, and 'Murder by Numbers' which, also, was decent. Here we have a crime thriller, a remake, and a pretty good movie. In this movie we can find Nicolas 'Put-the-bunny-back-in-the-box' Cage as a pawn in a crime gang who suddenly finds himself on top of the food chain, Ving Rhames as a drug addicted big boss (also of a gang) and finally David Caruso, as an unlucky bastard who finds himself in much trouble and is way in over his head. The movie begins with Caruso, a man who was in jail for hijacking cars, being free. He vows to remain safe and live a fair live. He has a family, works for the living, and doesn't do the things he shouldn't be doing anymore. And then his brother comes in on one night. Without spoiling, I will stop here and say that from this point on, this very scene already starts tearing apart the life he built here. Just see the movie, it's worth it. I'm serious. I mean, it was for me. Caruso's path of suffering continues through the movie, while the other characters seem to continue to wreak him a little more, but while still giving room to motivate him to go on. The ending, for me, was satisfying and realistic. The movie starts off quickly but loses it's pace between the third and second act, which cripples the otherwise delightful experience with the movie. It has some brutal scenes that are well placed and not too exceeded. There is much suspense throughout and it keeps you guessing on how it will end. Some scenes are just downright exciting, because the characters are so well characterized you'll just look forward to when Cage and Caruso will meet each other again. Cage's acting as well as Caruso's is superb in this one, with the first being like a kid on sugar despite suffering from asthma, and the latter always being the wrong man at the wrong place. Cage once again shows that he is made to put down roles of near-crazy people, really. Remember Face/Off? You get the same dose of craziness here. And, honestly? I love it. I just love how he does that unique kind of craziness that only he can do. As if you would mix sugar with a touch of drugs. You get the idea. It's a great movie, suffering a bit from the little usual mistakes. But don't miss out on it. Who knows? Maybe you'll find another cheesy Nicolas Cage line to make another internet meme out of!

    When I saw the 1947 original as a kid, nothing made an impression on me as did Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo. This new version tried to duplicate the menace of that character with Nick Cage playing a somewhat loony gangster, Little Junior Brown. Cage does a great job with the character, but is no Tommy Udo. But that is the gist of this version's problems: casting. We have David Caruso sleepwalking his way through as Jimmy Kilmartin, sort of the hero of the tale. Caruso is a truly one-dimensional actor. He has one expression, one tone of voice, one loss of composure schtick. Despite his flaming red hair, Caruso has virtually no screen presence. Nick Cage would have made a much better Kilmartin. Ving Rhaymes is under-utilized as Junior's gangster customer (and more). He'd have made a compelling Little Junior Brown. Samuel L. Jackson would have been better as the Ving Rhaymes character, and Stanley Tucci(?) and the actor Heald could have improved by switching parts. Helen Hunt (Bev Kilmartin) is killed off early in the movie, as Jimmy's first wife. She'd have been much better as the second wife, who gets to be in the entire movie. Most other casting in KOD is comparably off the mark. The movie is sometimes confusing and complex, yet at the same time draggy and predictable. It all leads to an unsatisfying and anti-climactic ending in which nothing is truly resolved beyond doubt. This is not a totally bad movie, it is just not a very good one. It lacks the grittiness and menace of the original, but adds nothing new to take up the slack except some graphic violence.

    This is an original take on the 1947 classic. What is has in common with that film is the central character played by David Caruso, who, when I first viewed the film, thought was ridiculous, but on second viewing have been able to appreciate the performance and the film much more. Like most modern crime-action films, it has a dynamite start with a massive heist of new cars that ends in a bloody shootout with the cops, but maintains the pace with acutely drawn underworld characterizations, especially Nicholas Cage as crime boss/killer "Junior Brown", a role that has Cage playing a muscle bound sadistic asthmatic running a topless bar. Equally impressive is Michael Rappaport's part as small time opportunistic chop shop operator Ronnie Gannon, a dangerous combination of con-game artist and violent felon. The film's biggest problem is the turf battle between the various cops which in one bizarre scene has them all gathered at a night-time meeting in a hard to believe showdown. But Caruso delivers, Cage is in a one of a kind role, and the film reeks with grit as it careens through its weird plot from heist to prison, to revenge.

Wish I could have seen more of Helen Hunt though. Verdict: No big shakes but still a cool thriller that's worth watching.

    Here we have ourselves a case of a fairly not wide known director, but not necessarily a bad director. Out of his sleeves we can find 'Desperate Measures', a movie about an autistic child, which was fairly good, and 'Murder by Numbers' which, also, was decent. Here we have a crime thriller, a remake, and a pretty good movie. In this movie we can find Nicolas 'Put-the-bunny-back-in-the-box' Cage as a pawn in a crime gang who suddenly finds himself on top of the food chain, Ving Rhames as a drug addicted big boss (also of a gang) and finally David Caruso, as an unlucky bastard who finds himself in much trouble and is way in over his head. The movie begins with Caruso, a man who was in jail for hijacking cars, being free. He vows to remain safe and live a fair live. He has a family, works for the living, and doesn't do the things he shouldn't be doing anymore. And then his brother comes in on one night. Without spoiling, I will stop here and say that from this point on, this very scene already starts tearing apart the life he built here. Just see the movie, it's worth it. I'm serious. I mean, it was for me. Caruso's path of suffering continues through the movie, while the other characters seem to continue to wreak him a little more, but while still giving room to motivate him to go on. The ending, for me, was satisfying and realistic. The movie starts off quickly but loses it's pace between the third and second act, which cripples the otherwise delightful experience with the movie. It has some brutal scenes that are well placed and not too exceeded. There is much suspense throughout and it keeps you guessing on how it will end. Some scenes are just downright exciting, because the characters are so well characterized you'll just look forward to when Cage and Caruso will meet each other again. Cage's acting as well as Caruso's is superb in this one, with the first being like a kid on sugar despite suffering from asthma, and the latter always being the wrong man at the wrong place. Cage once again shows that he is made to put down roles of near-crazy people, really. Remember Face/Off? You get the same dose of craziness here. And, honestly? I love it. I just love how he does that unique kind of craziness that only he can do. As if you would mix sugar with a touch of drugs. You get the idea. It's a great movie, suffering a bit from the little usual mistakes. But don't miss out on it. Who knows? Maybe you'll find another cheesy Nicolas Cage line to make another internet meme out of!

    When I saw the 1947 original as a kid, nothing made an impression on me as did Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo. This new version tried to duplicate the menace of that character with Nick Cage playing a somewhat loony gangster, Little Junior Brown. Cage does a great job with the character, but is no Tommy Udo. But that is the gist of this version's problems: casting. We have David Caruso sleepwalking his way through as Jimmy Kilmartin, sort of the hero of the tale. Caruso is a truly one-dimensional actor. He has one expression, one tone of voice, one loss of composure schtick. Despite his flaming red hair, Caruso has virtually no screen presence. Nick Cage would have made a much better Kilmartin. Ving Rhaymes is under-utilized as Junior's gangster customer (and more). He'd have made a compelling Little Junior Brown. Samuel L. Jackson would have been better as the Ving Rhaymes character, and Stanley Tucci(?) and the actor Heald could have improved by switching parts. Helen Hunt (Bev Kilmartin) is killed off early in the movie, as Jimmy's first wife. She'd have been much better as the second wife, who gets to be in the entire movie. Most other casting in KOD is comparably off the mark. The movie is sometimes confusing and complex, yet at the same time draggy and predictable. It all leads to an unsatisfying and anti-climactic ending in which nothing is truly resolved beyond doubt. This is not a totally bad movie, it is just not a very good one. It lacks the grittiness and menace of the original, but adds nothing new to take up the slack except some graphic violence.

    This is an original take on the 1947 classic. What is has in common with that film is the central character played by David Caruso, who, when I first viewed the film, thought was ridiculous, but on second viewing have been able to appreciate the performance and the film much more. Like most modern crime-action films, it has a dynamite start with a massive heist of new cars that ends in a bloody shootout with the cops, but maintains the pace with acutely drawn underworld characterizations, especially Nicholas Cage as crime boss/killer "Junior Brown", a role that has Cage playing a muscle bound sadistic asthmatic running a topless bar. Equally impressive is Michael Rappaport's part as small time opportunistic chop shop operator Ronnie Gannon, a dangerous combination of con-game artist and violent felon. The film's biggest problem is the turf battle between the various cops which in one bizarre scene has them all gathered at a night-time meeting in a hard to believe showdown. But Caruso delivers, Cage is in a one of a kind role, and the film reeks with grit as it careens through its weird plot from heist to prison, to revenge.

    Kiss of Death is directed by Barbet Schroeder and collectively written by Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer, Eleazar Lipsky and Richard Price. It stars David Caruso, Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Helen Hunt, Ving Rhames, Stanley Tucci, Kathryn Erbe, Michael Rapaport and Anthony Heald. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli. Reformed ex-con Jimmy Kilmartin (Caruso) reluctantly helps out his cousin transporting stolen cars but gets caught and ends up taking the fall for the whole caper. Back in prison and missing his wife and child, Jimmy gets offered a lifeline if he is prepared to go undercover with the police to bring down psychotic crime boss Little Junior Brown (Cage). A loose remake of the excellent 1947 film noir of the same name, Schroeder's Kiss of Death is slightly better than the iffy reputation afforded it. Yes it's more solid than anything resembling truly compelling, but it wears its noir heart on its sleeve and is very well performed by an impressive cast. Caruso's Kilmartin is a classic noir protagonist, a man who tries to go straight but gets dragged into a world of crime and shifty undercover machinations after doing one honest intention favour. From the point he agrees to help out Ronnie Gannon (Rapaport a jumping bean performance), he loses what he holds most dear and continually gets pulled from pillar to post by everyone around him. He's basically a good guy that fate has dealt a deadly hand, even when he gets a second chance at happiness it's not long before the door knocks and he's thrust into a deadly undercover game where he will be lucky to escape with his life intact. A lot has been made of TV star Caruso's unsuccessful attempt at breaking into films, with some believing that his performance here is mostly to blame. Yet in the context of a noir protagonist his performance is perfectly good, in fact it's a very subtle turn that isn't short on brooding intensity. That he is overshadowed by the likes of Cage (wonderfully on full tilt overdrive as a nut-case) and Jackson (calm yet assured presence) is no bad thing, especially since both come with noir infected ticks (Jackson has a continuous weeping eye/Cage has a phobia about metal in his mouth). Caruso does good here, bringing the character to life without histrionics, he helps the audience understand his frustration as he spins in his vortex of disharmony. Nobody is done any favours by a screenplay that doesn't take chances, and at times it comes close to standing still in the mid-section, while the climax is a little underwhelming. But for a piece of pulpy neo-noir it has enough about it to make it worth a look. 6.5/10

    As with any role she assays, Kathryn Erbe creates a character of such depth and meaning that she deservedly receives most of the attention of audiences. Here, she takes an underwritten part and through her compassion, spirituality, and sensuality makes the film her own. Anyone who has watched her on Law and Order: Criminal Intent, OZ, Homicide: Life On the Street on television, or seen the films Dream With the Fishes, 3 Backyards, or especially and most notably Blume In Love, realizes Ms. Erbe is an actor's actor. She is certainly one of the most gifted women working as an actor in any medium. Over the course of Criminal Intent, she was able to keep the character of Eames fresh and real while holding her own with grace as her co-star did everything possible to overshadow her. There was, however, no ignoring Ms. Erbe's presence. The film now being discussed is a weak remake and not very good, simply put. Yet Kathryn Erbe makes her part shine and with a subtle power makes her character outstanding. She deserves an opportunity in better quality films to demonstrate how gifted and talented she is. She has done this time after time on stage and whether in film or on television, audiences are always in for something very special when her name appears in the credits.

    Barbet Schroeder has not had what anyone would call a very fruitful American period. In between the Wilderesque black comedy masterwork REVERSAL OF FORTUNE and the pedestrian MURDER BY NUMBERS came this in-name-only remake of Henry Hathaway's 1947 classic. David Caruso, possessing none of the presence or gravitas it takes to carry a film, stars as a con trying to go straight but is tripped up by his involvement with degenerate gangster Nicolas Cage (as Little Junior Brown -- that name being one of the few clever things in the film). Schroeder directs the film at a brisk clip but it's all for naught; the material is just nothing special. Appearances by Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci (as a self-serving prosecutor), Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Rappaport add very little.

    This loosely-based remake of a 1947 film noir seems to have few followers, even after 17 years. It made no money in theaters and very few people have commented on it here. TV actor David Caruso plays Jimmy, a small-time criminal who gets sent back to the slammer after taking part in a bungled heist. Worse, his wife is killed in a car accident while he's doing time and his young daughter is sent to live with his hostile mother in law. When he gets out, the state and feds just won't leave him alone. They want him to help them nab Junior, played by a pumped-up, almost unrecognizable Nic Cage. Turns out Junior was the mastermind behind the fumbled heist and numerous other crimes. So Caruso's character goes undercover. The film is violent and foul-mouthed, a far cay from the Victor Mature-Richard-Widmark original. The story has been "opened up," as the 1947 version was largely a soundstage production. It's hard to compare the two, so many changes have been made and liberties taken with the 1995 remake. I watched the two films back to back the other night. Both have their merits. Caruso's Jimmy is a lot more spunky than Mature's hero, and Cage's over the top villain is worlds apart from Widmark's sneering, oily bad guy. Cage portrays Junior (called Tommy Udo in the 1947 version) as an over-sized psychopath with some very odd ticks and habits, and he is truly demented and scary. By comparison, Widmark's Udo is almost comical, a Damon Runyonesque gangster who would fit right in in a production of "Guys and Dolls." Plus the remake boasts a stellar supporting cast, including Helen Hunt as Jimmy's ill-fated wife, Stanley Tucci as a two-faced prosecutor, Michael Rappaport as Jimmy's larcenous cousin, Kathryn "Criminal Intent" Erbe as Jimmy's loyal friend and Sam Jackson as a detective who has a bone to pick with Jimmy. See both films. It couldn't hurt.

    I'm going to keep this short for posterity sake if you like thrillers this movie is for you. If you like movies this movie is for you. Not only is the story amazing, that goes without saying, but it's the little subtleties that really make the difference; the directing in terms of the mise en scene present in divine, the lighting throughout is spectacular. All and all the The Kiss of Death is a great film, containing great acting, particularly by Nicolas Cage. Speaking of thrillers and Nic Cage he's got a new one coming out called Trespass that looks pretty cool. Check out the trailer then thank me for changing your life. http://bitly.com/qN22Cm

    I think the best way to approach this movie is on its own terms rather than as a remake of the 1940s film. In any case, it merely follows the general story outline of the earlier picture. What makes it altogether new is Richard Price's screenplay, Barbet Schroeder's direction, a great lineup of actors, and location shooting in some of New York City's seediest and most squalid areas. Along with the great locations, what really provides the atmosphere is Price's writing. Once again he shows his down to the ground knowledge of the characters, mannerisms, and lingo of the creeps and hoodlums in the big city underworld, and the law enforcement people who deal with them. And there is also Price's trademark offbeat humor. While the earlier film gave us Richard Widmark as a really scary psycho, in this later film Richard Price has given us Little Junior Brown, a bulked-up killer with a child's mind and an abiding faith in the nostrums of New Age philosophy. What a delight when Little Junior, fresh from committing murder, asks our hero to take the next day off so they can get together and "talk about life and stuff"! Or when he urges him to settle on an acronym that will give shape to his identity. (Little Junior's is B-A-D--for "Balls, Attitude, Direction.") Nicholas Cage is often accused of playing over the top, but in the case of Little Junior, over the top is the way to go. There are also good performances by Stanley Tucci and Samuel L. Jackson. Tucci excels in portraying charming snakes. When he leers and sneers, it is impossible to keep from watching him. This movie was really very enjoyable.

    It's refreshing to see such old movies now for a change. A young, tough-built Nicolas Cage as a mean gangsta, the pretty Helen Hunt in a 2-minute role as an innocent house wife, a very lean Samuel Jackson as a just cop, and of course David Caruso too. All these actors are huge stars today but if in the mid 90's I were to tell them about their super-stardom future, they might have choked in laughter. About the movie, it's a neat good guy vs the underworld story, very engaging from start to end. The best act was Nicolas Cage's who chills as a baddie. Wish I could have seen more of Helen Hunt though. Verdict: No big shakes but still a cool thriller that's worth watching.

Plus the remake boasts a stellar supporting cast, including Helen Hunt as Jimmy's ill-fated wife, Stanley Tucci as a two-faced prosecutor, Michael Rappaport as Jimmy's larcenous cousin, Kathryn "Criminal Intent" Erbe as Jimmy's loyal friend and Sam Jackson as a detective who has a bone to pick with Jimmy. See both films. It couldn't hurt.

    I'm going to keep this short for posterity sake if you like thrillers this movie is for you. If you like movies this movie is for you. Not only is the story amazing, that goes without saying, but it's the little subtleties that really make the difference; the directing in terms of the mise en scene present in divine, the lighting throughout is spectacular. All and all the The Kiss of Death is a great film, containing great acting, particularly by Nicolas Cage. Speaking of thrillers and Nic Cage he's got a new one coming out called Trespass that looks pretty cool. Check out the trailer then thank me for changing your life. http://bitly.com/qN22Cm

    I think the best way to approach this movie is on its own terms rather than as a remake of the 1940s film. In any case, it merely follows the general story outline of the earlier picture. What makes it altogether new is Richard Price's screenplay, Barbet Schroeder's direction, a great lineup of actors, and location shooting in some of New York City's seediest and most squalid areas. Along with the great locations, what really provides the atmosphere is Price's writing. Once again he shows his down to the ground knowledge of the characters, mannerisms, and lingo of the creeps and hoodlums in the big city underworld, and the law enforcement people who deal with them. And there is also Price's trademark offbeat humor. While the earlier film gave us Richard Widmark as a really scary psycho, in this later film Richard Price has given us Little Junior Brown, a bulked-up killer with a child's mind and an abiding faith in the nostrums of New Age philosophy. What a delight when Little Junior, fresh from committing murder, asks our hero to take the next day off so they can get together and "talk about life and stuff"! Or when he urges him to settle on an acronym that will give shape to his identity. (Little Junior's is B-A-D--for "Balls, Attitude, Direction.") Nicholas Cage is often accused of playing over the top, but in the case of Little Junior, over the top is the way to go. There are also good performances by Stanley Tucci and Samuel L. Jackson. Tucci excels in portraying charming snakes. When he leers and sneers, it is impossible to keep from watching him. This movie was really very enjoyable.

    It's refreshing to see such old movies now for a change. A young, tough-built Nicolas Cage as a mean gangsta, the pretty Helen Hunt in a 2-minute role as an innocent house wife, a very lean Samuel Jackson as a just cop, and of course David Caruso too. All these actors are huge stars today but if in the mid 90's I were to tell them about their super-stardom future, they might have choked in laughter. About the movie, it's a neat good guy vs the underworld story, very engaging from start to end. The best act was Nicolas Cage's who chills as a baddie. Wish I could have seen more of Helen Hunt though. Verdict: No big shakes but still a cool thriller that's worth watching.

    Here we have ourselves a case of a fairly not wide known director, but not necessarily a bad director. Out of his sleeves we can find 'Desperate Measures', a movie about an autistic child, which was fairly good, and 'Murder by Numbers' which, also, was decent. Here we have a crime thriller, a remake, and a pretty good movie. In this movie we can find Nicolas 'Put-the-bunny-back-in-the-box' Cage as a pawn in a crime gang who suddenly finds himself on top of the food chain, Ving Rhames as a drug addicted big boss (also of a gang) and finally David Caruso, as an unlucky bastard who finds himself in much trouble and is way in over his head. The movie begins with Caruso, a man who was in jail for hijacking cars, being free. He vows to remain safe and live a fair live. He has a family, works for the living, and doesn't do the things he shouldn't be doing anymore. And then his brother comes in on one night. Without spoiling, I will stop here and say that from this point on, this very scene already starts tearing apart the life he built here. Just see the movie, it's worth it. I'm serious. I mean, it was for me. Caruso's path of suffering continues through the movie, while the other characters seem to continue to wreak him a little more, but while still giving room to motivate him to go on. The ending, for me, was satisfying and realistic. The movie starts off quickly but loses it's pace between the third and second act, which cripples the otherwise delightful experience with the movie. It has some brutal scenes that are well placed and not too exceeded. There is much suspense throughout and it keeps you guessing on how it will end. Some scenes are just downright exciting, because the characters are so well characterized you'll just look forward to when Cage and Caruso will meet each other again. Cage's acting as well as Caruso's is superb in this one, with the first being like a kid on sugar despite suffering from asthma, and the latter always being the wrong man at the wrong place. Cage once again shows that he is made to put down roles of near-crazy people, really. Remember Face/Off? You get the same dose of craziness here. And, honestly? I love it. I just love how he does that unique kind of craziness that only he can do. As if you would mix sugar with a touch of drugs. You get the idea. It's a great movie, suffering a bit from the little usual mistakes. But don't miss out on it. Who knows? Maybe you'll find another cheesy Nicolas Cage line to make another internet meme out of!

    When I saw the 1947 original as a kid, nothing made an impression on me as did Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo. This new version tried to duplicate the menace of that character with Nick Cage playing a somewhat loony gangster, Little Junior Brown. Cage does a great job with the character, but is no Tommy Udo. But that is the gist of this version's problems: casting. We have David Caruso sleepwalking his way through as Jimmy Kilmartin, sort of the hero of the tale. Caruso is a truly one-dimensional actor. He has one expression, one tone of voice, one loss of composure schtick. Despite his flaming red hair, Caruso has virtually no screen presence. Nick Cage would have made a much better Kilmartin. Ving Rhaymes is under-utilized as Junior's gangster customer (and more). He'd have made a compelling Little Junior Brown. Samuel L. Jackson would have been better as the Ving Rhaymes character, and Stanley Tucci(?) and the actor Heald could have improved by switching parts. Helen Hunt (Bev Kilmartin) is killed off early in the movie, as Jimmy's first wife. She'd have been much better as the second wife, who gets to be in the entire movie. Most other casting in KOD is comparably off the mark. The movie is sometimes confusing and complex, yet at the same time draggy and predictable. It all leads to an unsatisfying and anti-climactic ending in which nothing is truly resolved beyond doubt. This is not a totally bad movie, it is just not a very good one. It lacks the grittiness and menace of the original, but adds nothing new to take up the slack except some graphic violence.

    This is an original take on the 1947 classic. What is has in common with that film is the central character played by David Caruso, who, when I first viewed the film, thought was ridiculous, but on second viewing have been able to appreciate the performance and the film much more. Like most modern crime-action films, it has a dynamite start with a massive heist of new cars that ends in a bloody shootout with the cops, but maintains the pace with acutely drawn underworld characterizations, especially Nicholas Cage as crime boss/killer "Junior Brown", a role that has Cage playing a muscle bound sadistic asthmatic running a topless bar. Equally impressive is Michael Rappaport's part as small time opportunistic chop shop operator Ronnie Gannon, a dangerous combination of con-game artist and violent felon. The film's biggest problem is the turf battle between the various cops which in one bizarre scene has them all gathered at a night-time meeting in a hard to believe showdown. But Caruso delivers, Cage is in a one of a kind role, and the film reeks with grit as it careens through its weird plot from heist to prison, to revenge.

    Kiss of Death is directed by Barbet Schroeder and collectively written by Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer, Eleazar Lipsky and Richard Price. It stars David Caruso, Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Helen Hunt, Ving Rhames, Stanley Tucci, Kathryn Erbe, Michael Rapaport and Anthony Heald. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli. Reformed ex-con Jimmy Kilmartin (Caruso) reluctantly helps out his cousin transporting stolen cars but gets caught and ends up taking the fall for the whole caper. Back in prison and missing his wife and child, Jimmy gets offered a lifeline if he is prepared to go undercover with the police to bring down psychotic crime boss Little Junior Brown (Cage). A loose remake of the excellent 1947 film noir of the same name, Schroeder's Kiss of Death is slightly better than the iffy reputation afforded it. Yes it's more solid than anything resembling truly compelling, but it wears its noir heart on its sleeve and is very well performed by an impressive cast. Caruso's Kilmartin is a classic noir protagonist, a man who tries to go straight but gets dragged into a world of crime and shifty undercover machinations after doing one honest intention favour. From the point he agrees to help out Ronnie Gannon (Rapaport a jumping bean performance), he loses what he holds most dear and continually gets pulled from pillar to post by everyone around him. He's basically a good guy that fate has dealt a deadly hand, even when he gets a second chance at happiness it's not long before the door knocks and he's thrust into a deadly undercover game where he will be lucky to escape with his life intact. A lot has been made of TV star Caruso's unsuccessful attempt at breaking into films, with some believing that his performance here is mostly to blame. Yet in the context of a noir protagonist his performance is perfectly good, in fact it's a very subtle turn that isn't short on brooding intensity. That he is overshadowed by the likes of Cage (wonderfully on full tilt overdrive as a nut-case) and Jackson (calm yet assured presence) is no bad thing, especially since both come with noir infected ticks (Jackson has a continuous weeping eye/Cage has a phobia about metal in his mouth). Caruso does good here, bringing the character to life without histrionics, he helps the audience understand his frustration as he spins in his vortex of disharmony. Nobody is done any favours by a screenplay that doesn't take chances, and at times it comes close to standing still in the mid-section, while the climax is a little underwhelming. But for a piece of pulpy neo-noir it has enough about it to make it worth a look. 6.5/10

    As with any role she assays, Kathryn Erbe creates a character of such depth and meaning that she deservedly receives most of the attention of audiences. Here, she takes an underwritten part and through her compassion, spirituality, and sensuality makes the film her own. Anyone who has watched her on Law and Order: Criminal Intent, OZ, Homicide: Life On the Street on television, or seen the films Dream With the Fishes, 3 Backyards, or especially and most notably Blume In Love, realizes Ms. Erbe is an actor's actor. She is certainly one of the most gifted women working as an actor in any medium. Over the course of Criminal Intent, she was able to keep the character of Eames fresh and real while holding her own with grace as her co-star did everything possible to overshadow her. There was, however, no ignoring Ms. Erbe's presence. The film now being discussed is a weak remake and not very good, simply put. Yet Kathryn Erbe makes her part shine and with a subtle power makes her character outstanding. She deserves an opportunity in better quality films to demonstrate how gifted and talented she is. She has done this time after time on stage and whether in film or on television, audiences are always in for something very special when her name appears in the credits.

    Barbet Schroeder has not had what anyone would call a very fruitful American period. In between the Wilderesque black comedy masterwork REVERSAL OF FORTUNE and the pedestrian MURDER BY NUMBERS came this in-name-only remake of Henry Hathaway's 1947 classic. David Caruso, possessing none of the presence or gravitas it takes to carry a film, stars as a con trying to go straight but is tripped up by his involvement with degenerate gangster Nicolas Cage (as Little Junior Brown -- that name being one of the few clever things in the film). Schroeder directs the film at a brisk clip but it's all for naught; the material is just nothing special. Appearances by Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci (as a self-serving prosecutor), Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Rappaport add very little.

    This loosely-based remake of a 1947 film noir seems to have few followers, even after 17 years. It made no money in theaters and very few people have commented on it here. TV actor David Caruso plays Jimmy, a small-time criminal who gets sent back to the slammer after taking part in a bungled heist. Worse, his wife is killed in a car accident while he's doing time and his young daughter is sent to live with his hostile mother in law. When he gets out, the state and feds just won't leave him alone. They want him to help them nab Junior, played by a pumped-up, almost unrecognizable Nic Cage. Turns out Junior was the mastermind behind the fumbled heist and numerous other crimes. So Caruso's character goes undercover. The film is violent and foul-mouthed, a far cay from the Victor Mature-Richard-Widmark original. The story has been "opened up," as the 1947 version was largely a soundstage production. It's hard to compare the two, so many changes have been made and liberties taken with the 1995 remake. I watched the two films back to back the other night. Both have their merits. Caruso's Jimmy is a lot more spunky than Mature's hero, and Cage's over the top villain is worlds apart from Widmark's sneering, oily bad guy. Cage portrays Junior (called Tommy Udo in the 1947 version) as an over-sized psychopath with some very odd ticks and habits, and he is truly demented and scary. By comparison, Widmark's Udo is almost comical, a Damon Runyonesque gangster who would fit right in in a production of "Guys and Dolls." Plus the remake boasts a stellar supporting cast, including Helen Hunt as Jimmy's ill-fated wife, Stanley Tucci as a two-faced prosecutor, Michael Rappaport as Jimmy's larcenous cousin, Kathryn "Criminal Intent" Erbe as Jimmy's loyal friend and Sam Jackson as a detective who has a bone to pick with Jimmy. See both films. It couldn't hurt.

    As with any role she assays, Kathryn Erbe creates a character of such depth and meaning that she deservedly receives most of the attention of audiences. Here, she takes an underwritten part and through her compassion, spirituality, and sensuality makes the film her own. Anyone who has watched her on Law and Order: Criminal Intent, OZ, Homicide: Life On the Street on television, or seen the films Dream With the Fishes, 3 Backyards, or especially and most notably Blume In Love, realizes Ms. Erbe is an actor's actor. She is certainly one of the most gifted women working as an actor in any medium. Over the course of Criminal Intent, she was able to keep the character of Eames fresh and real while holding her own with grace as her co-star did everything possible to overshadow her. There was, however, no ignoring Ms. Erbe's presence. The film now being discussed is a weak remake and not very good, simply put. Yet Kathryn Erbe makes her part shine and with a subtle power makes her character outstanding. She deserves an opportunity in better quality films to demonstrate how gifted and talented she is. She has done this time after time on stage and whether in film or on television, audiences are always in for something very special when her name appears in the credits.

    Barbet Schroeder has not had what anyone would call a very fruitful American period. In between the Wilderesque black comedy masterwork REVERSAL OF FORTUNE and the pedestrian MURDER BY NUMBERS came this in-name-only remake of Henry Hathaway's 1947 classic. David Caruso, possessing none of the presence or gravitas it takes to carry a film, stars as a con trying to go straight but is tripped up by his involvement with degenerate gangster Nicolas Cage (as Little Junior Brown -- that name being one of the few clever things in the film). Schroeder directs the film at a brisk clip but it's all for naught; the material is just nothing special. Appearances by Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci (as a self-serving prosecutor), Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Rappaport add very little.

    This loosely-based remake of a 1947 film noir seems to have few followers, even after 17 years. It made no money in theaters and very few people have commented on it here. TV actor David Caruso plays Jimmy, a small-time criminal who gets sent back to the slammer after taking part in a bungled heist. Worse, his wife is killed in a car accident while he's doing time and his young daughter is sent to live with his hostile mother in law. When he gets out, the state and feds just won't leave him alone. They want him to help them nab Junior, played by a pumped-up, almost unrecognizable Nic Cage. Turns out Junior was the mastermind behind the fumbled heist and numerous other crimes. So Caruso's character goes undercover. The film is violent and foul-mouthed, a far cay from the Victor Mature-Richard-Widmark original. The story has been "opened up," as the 1947 version was largely a soundstage production. It's hard to compare the two, so many changes have been made and liberties taken with the 1995 remake. I watched the two films back to back the other night. Both have their merits. Caruso's Jimmy is a lot more spunky than Mature's hero, and Cage's over the top villain is worlds apart from Widmark's sneering, oily bad guy. Cage portrays Junior (called Tommy Udo in the 1947 version) as an over-sized psychopath with some very odd ticks and habits, and he is truly demented and scary. By comparison, Widmark's Udo is almost comical, a Damon Runyonesque gangster who would fit right in in a production of "Guys and Dolls." Plus the remake boasts a stellar supporting cast, including Helen Hunt as Jimmy's ill-fated wife, Stanley Tucci as a two-faced prosecutor, Michael Rappaport as Jimmy's larcenous cousin, Kathryn "Criminal Intent" Erbe as Jimmy's loyal friend and Sam Jackson as a detective who has a bone to pick with Jimmy. See both films. It couldn't hurt.

    I'm going to keep this short for posterity sake if you like thrillers this movie is for you. If you like movies this movie is for you. Not only is the story amazing, that goes without saying, but it's the little subtleties that really make the difference; the directing in terms of the mise en scene present in divine, the lighting throughout is spectacular. All and all the The Kiss of Death is a great film, containing great acting, particularly by Nicolas Cage. Speaking of thrillers and Nic Cage he's got a new one coming out called Trespass that looks pretty cool. Check out the trailer then thank me for changing your life. http://bitly.com/qN22Cm

    I think the best way to approach this movie is on its own terms rather than as a remake of the 1940s film. In any case, it merely follows the general story outline of the earlier picture. What makes it altogether new is Richard Price's screenplay, Barbet Schroeder's direction, a great lineup of actors, and location shooting in some of New York City's seediest and most squalid areas. Along with the great locations, what really provides the atmosphere is Price's writing. Once again he shows his down to the ground knowledge of the characters, mannerisms, and lingo of the creeps and hoodlums in the big city underworld, and the law enforcement people who deal with them. And there is also Price's trademark offbeat humor. While the earlier film gave us Richard Widmark as a really scary psycho, in this later film Richard Price has given us Little Junior Brown, a bulked-up killer with a child's mind and an abiding faith in the nostrums of New Age philosophy. What a delight when Little Junior, fresh from committing murder, asks our hero to take the next day off so they can get together and "talk about life and stuff"! Or when he urges him to settle on an acronym that will give shape to his identity. (Little Junior's is B-A-D--for "Balls, Attitude, Direction.") Nicholas Cage is often accused of playing over the top, but in the case of Little Junior, over the top is the way to go. There are also good performances by Stanley Tucci and Samuel L. Jackson. Tucci excels in portraying charming snakes. When he leers and sneers, it is impossible to keep from watching him. This movie was really very enjoyable.

    It's refreshing to see such old movies now for a change. A young, tough-built Nicolas Cage as a mean gangsta, the pretty Helen Hunt in a 2-minute role as an innocent house wife, a very lean Samuel Jackson as a just cop, and of course David Caruso too. All these actors are huge stars today but if in the mid 90's I were to tell them about their super-stardom future, they might have choked in laughter. About the movie, it's a neat good guy vs the underworld story, very engaging from start to end. The best act was Nicolas Cage's who chills as a baddie. Wish I could have seen more of Helen Hunt though. Verdict: No big shakes but still a cool thriller that's worth watching.

    Here we have ourselves a case of a fairly not wide known director, but not necessarily a bad director. Out of his sleeves we can find 'Desperate Measures', a movie about an autistic child, which was fairly good, and 'Murder by Numbers' which, also, was decent. Here we have a crime thriller, a remake, and a pretty good movie. In this movie we can find Nicolas 'Put-the-bunny-back-in-the-box' Cage as a pawn in a crime gang who suddenly finds himself on top of the food chain, Ving Rhames as a drug addicted big boss (also of a gang) and finally David Caruso, as an unlucky bastard who finds himself in much trouble and is way in over his head. The movie begins with Caruso, a man who was in jail for hijacking cars, being free. He vows to remain safe and live a fair live. He has a family, works for the living, and doesn't do the things he shouldn't be doing anymore. And then his brother comes in on one night. Without spoiling, I will stop here and say that from this point on, this very scene already starts tearing apart the life he built here. Just see the movie, it's worth it. I'm serious. I mean, it was for me. Caruso's path of suffering continues through the movie, while the other characters seem to continue to wreak him a little more, but while still giving room to motivate him to go on. The ending, for me, was satisfying and realistic. The movie starts off quickly but loses it's pace between the third and second act, which cripples the otherwise delightful experience with the movie. It has some brutal scenes that are well placed and not too exceeded. There is much suspense throughout and it keeps you guessing on how it will end. Some scenes are just downright exciting, because the characters are so well characterized you'll just look forward to when Cage and Caruso will meet each other again. Cage's acting as well as Caruso's is superb in this one, with the first being like a kid on sugar despite suffering from asthma, and the latter always being the wrong man at the wrong place. Cage once again shows that he is made to put down roles of near-crazy people, really. Remember Face/Off? You get the same dose of craziness here. And, honestly? I love it. I just love how he does that unique kind of craziness that only he can do. As if you would mix sugar with a touch of drugs. You get the idea. It's a great movie, suffering a bit from the little usual mistakes. But don't miss out on it. Who knows? Maybe you'll find another cheesy Nicolas Cage line to make another internet meme out of!

    When I saw the 1947 original as a kid, nothing made an impression on me as did Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo. This new version tried to duplicate the menace of that character with Nick Cage playing a somewhat loony gangster, Little Junior Brown. Cage does a great job with the character, but is no Tommy Udo. But that is the gist of this version's problems: casting. We have David Caruso sleepwalking his way through as Jimmy Kilmartin, sort of the hero of the tale. Caruso is a truly one-dimensional actor. He has one expression, one tone of voice, one loss of composure schtick. Despite his flaming red hair, Caruso has virtually no screen presence. Nick Cage would have made a much better Kilmartin. Ving Rhaymes is under-utilized as Junior's gangster customer (and more). He'd have made a compelling Little Junior Brown. Samuel L. Jackson would have been better as the Ving Rhaymes character, and Stanley Tucci(?) and the actor Heald could have improved by switching parts. Helen Hunt (Bev Kilmartin) is killed off early in the movie, as Jimmy's first wife. She'd have been much better as the second wife, who gets to be in the entire movie. Most other casting in KOD is comparably off the mark. The movie is sometimes confusing and complex, yet at the same time draggy and predictable. It all leads to an unsatisfying and anti-climactic ending in which nothing is truly resolved beyond doubt. This is not a totally bad movie, it is just not a very good one. It lacks the grittiness and menace of the original, but adds nothing new to take up the slack except some graphic violence.

    This is an original take on the 1947 classic. What is has in common with that film is the central character played by David Caruso, who, when I first viewed the film, thought was ridiculous, but on second viewing have been able to appreciate the performance and the film much more. Like most modern crime-action films, it has a dynamite start with a massive heist of new cars that ends in a bloody shootout with the cops, but maintains the pace with acutely drawn underworld characterizations, especially Nicholas Cage as crime boss/killer "Junior Brown", a role that has Cage playing a muscle bound sadistic asthmatic running a topless bar. Equally impressive is Michael Rappaport's part as small time opportunistic chop shop operator Ronnie Gannon, a dangerous combination of con-game artist and violent felon. The film's biggest problem is the turf battle between the various cops which in one bizarre scene has them all gathered at a night-time meeting in a hard to believe showdown. But Caruso delivers, Cage is in a one of a kind role, and the film reeks with grit as it careens through its weird plot from heist to prison, to revenge.
