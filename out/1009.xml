    I saw this movie back in 1998 and I remembered I like it, but watched it again today. It's actually a very good movie and has gorgeous scenery and makes you want to go to Tuscany. There is a lot of nudity of both sexes. Gross. I'm not a prude, I just don't like seeing certain body parts on the big screen. Double gross. Liv Tyler is really beautiful, but I think it takes something away from a movie when you see people's giblets and gravy. I wish that all movies just cut away from that stuff-we know what they are going to do!Anyway, the best scenes are between Liv Tyler and Jeremy Irons. There are a couple of scenes that are very weird-must be very Italian. The best part of the entire movie, however, is the house, its gorgeous. Except the ugly statues everywhere.

    I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie "Stealing Beauty" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called "apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama." I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them. I re-watched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness. This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany. Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, "Enchanting April" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic. Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it. Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. "Stealing Beauty" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.

    Do we leer when we watch films by Bertolucci and Woody Allen? Do you leer? For all their supposed investigation of the celebration of nubile women by middle aged and old men, neither filmmaker quite convinces me that he has quite the interest in these young women that all the artifice, music, flowers, lovely scenery, and other settings suggest. I know that actresses report liking to work with Mr. Allen, as do actors. I am aware that we no longer make that gender distinction but humour me for a moment. Bertolucci has a reputation for pushing actors to full disclosure, as it were. No one discloses anything here. I just saw "Stealing Beauty" for the first time this week during the summer 2012. I find it implausible that a large household of odd mostly male characters would devote a summer contemplating the virginity of a girl. Leering defines, I suppose, a theme for a film as much as any other topic. The loss of virginity seems to me the theme of adolescent films but a bit too much and too little for a film filled with randy old men but these old men seem long past being randy while the young men mostly seem nascent old me without substance. Roger Ebert as usual pins this film in his review. Read it. The men, young and old, lack substance and the nubile girl never becomes a person. Woody Allen usually suggests that the object of desire is a human being and an engaging one at that. Bertolucci does not bother. I rate his film highly because here Bertolucci perfects his leering.

    All the delightful characters, so well developed, and the mystery sub-plot, perhaps help us old fellers feel not so guilty about watching teen Liv Tyler sport about in short, filmy dresses, or less. Yep, she's gorgeous. But where will this movie go? Will it follow its intrigues and conflicts to their resolutions, and thus show that it is more about story than underwear? As the answer to Juicy Lucy's mystery brings us to further interpersonal conflicts, will these be heeded? Unfortunately not. In the postscript to Lolita, Nabakov defines pornography (very soft, and quite pleasant, here) as successive escalations of eroticism to climax. Ultimately, in Stealing Beauty, that escalation takes over, as the director kills all art-house soap opera with the deflowering of his own movie's purported innocence, and with rather sudden ideal romance. Shouldn't we see a bit more flirtation between Lucy and her true love? As in even this softest porn, the rule is that story and character play second fiddle to sex. Story ends when the sculptor tells Lucy, 'This will be our secret.' He doesn't have to tell his wife! His wife isn't even more strongly driven to return to Ireland. Lucy has to continue to pretend she is merely a visitor. Doesn't she want to tell her sister, "You are my half-sister?" All that gets dropped, for a bit of sim-sex, that is supposed to feel like a climax. Oh, yeah, and the three long-distance shots of the villa: It was a little disconcerting to keep seeing Gladiator Maximus's villa, supposedly in Spain, here in Tuscany. But for a place 2000 years old, it was well preserved.

    Is this movie about a young girl's search for the truth about her parents? Is it about her yearning to become a woman? Or is it just about sex? I'll leave it to you to decide. Liv Tyler is alluring as the young American who returns to Italy to delve into her mother's mysterious past. Jeremy Irons has little to do as her ailing British confidant, and extra support comes from Joseph Fiennes, Sinead Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Stefania Sandrelli, Jean Marais, D.W. Moffett and Donald McCann. Bertolucci's film, from his own original story, gets its strength from the visual. Art direction is inspired and cinematography is picturesque. Little else uplifts.

    Watching this is like taking a leisurely vacation in the rolling hills of Tuscany. I don't think there's any place in America that has such a sky. The sun seems a misty ochre and the land, where it's not tilled in straight furrows, consists of gravel paths between low stone walls, olive groves, chest-high grape arbors, and dark sturdy oaks. The arbors are populated by hordes of skittery lizards, Lacerta muralis. It's no wonder that summer dinners so often are eaten on long tables al fresco. What an appealing location. And that, maybe, is the principal virtue of Bernardo Bertolucci's "Stealing Beauty." It takes patience and concentration to follow the story closely enough to be engaged by it, and, at heart, there really isn't much to it. A visiting American, the pretty and leggy Liv Tyler, finds out that a local artist is probably her real father, and shortly afterward gives up her virginity to an equally inexperienced local boy. There's a lot of casual conversation, some of which seems to have little point. The function of some characters is a bit obscure. Jeremy Irons, a splendid actor, plays an older man who offers to serve as Liv Tyler's father. He's ill and is finally driven away in an ambulance. An almost unrecognizable Jean Marais is a dotty French visitor. Where do the French get these actors? They're sympatico without being particularly handsome. Jean Gabin, Philippe Noiret. I think I'll exclude Yves Montand because a girl friend once told me he was handsome, and I'm not talking about physical beauty. With Bernardo Bertolucci you generally get some fairly explicit sex, as you do here. There is a party one night. After the guests are exhausted by all that dancing, they retire to engage in sexual activities of various stripes. (Poor Rachel Weisz.) But it's far from soft-core porn. Bertolucci avoids the billowing curtains and candle light clich&eacute;s. There are no fingertips caressing unidentifiable furrows of someone else's body. When the sweet but innocent Italian boy is about to deflower Liv Tyler, he asks, "Can you help me?", and she slides her hand down inside his jeans. It's not exactly a torrid scene, though, and it doesn't end dramatically. The next morning, strolling back to the villa, the kid says that he'd like to follow her to America. She turns and replies, "Do so." And that's that. The kid runs off, waving, and we don't know whether he'll follow her or not, nor do we care anymore than Liv Tyler seems to care. It's in no way a breakthrough film. Bertolucci takes his time and forces us to relax too. There's no violence and no tragedy. I have some trouble imagining most teen-aged kids enjoying this, especially the boys, whose taste and patience have been eroded over the years by exposure to a nimiety of films in which a shoot out with ugly guns has to take place every ten minutes. (Compare the original 1974 "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" with this year's remake, for an example of how esthetic values have devolved.) Liv Tyler gets stung on the arm and the breast by bees, but, you know what? I don't care. I'd like to be among that crowd for a summer. Sure, it would be tough, brushing up on whatever Italian I remember, but I wouldn't have to relearn any of it if Liv Tyler and her legs should come visiting. She speaks surprisingly good English for an American.

    I didn't see this film when it first came out, because I kept reading these terrible reviews. One review has stuck with me, for 12 years. "Liv Tyler is the perfect piece of cardboard." I don't remember who said that, but that line kept me from seeing this film. This film was offered for free on cable on-demand, and since then, I've watched several times. Probably about 20 times. Why do I keep watching it? Because details are revealed each and ever time I see it. Things that I didn't notice before. Liv Tyler gives a very subtle and masterful performance in this film. Her character is experiencing things internally, and it would be inappropriate for her to be wildly expressive. Her character is reacting to her surroundings, but her reactions fall under the radar of normal viewing. The opening scene is shot on (what looks like) digital video by a man on the plane from America to Italy. I didn't notice at first, but, there is a close-up of this man's wrist, wearing a leather bracelet. Fast forward several scenes and this close up of this same bracelet appears on the wrist of this character "Carlo Liska"...and this leads me to believe that the man on the plane was this character "Carlo." But, back to Liv Tyler's character, "Lucy"...this character is a virgin, but that doesn't make her unsophisticated. She speaks Italian, smokes marijuana, and (really forward-thinking for 1996) fearlessly allows a man - a character of a writer (probably dying from AIDS) played by Jeremy Irons, to dress an open, bleeding wound on her knee. AIDS isn't mentioned, but it is implied. Making the subject of sex (circa 1996) that much more shocking. This is a dangerous activity, according to the zeitgeist of the 1990s. Life and death. I like to have this film just playing in the background, because the music is pleasant, and it's pretty much like being on vacation in Tuscany. It isn't a demanding film. It doesn't scream at you. It meanders from beautiful shot to beautiful shot, and having seen it 20 times already, I can leave the room and come back and it's still like a vacation in Tuscany. Naked, beautiful people on the surface, but there's more there if you choose to look.

    This is my favorite movie ever!!! Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast are excellent in this movie. The Tuscan scenery is gorgeous. It makes you wish you were there. I loved the story. The more you watch it the more you love it because you appreciate the surroundings, the music, the beautiful story. The only thing I had a hard time with was the beginning and how it related to the rest of the story. Also, I am usually not a fan of soundtracks, but the Stealing Beauty soundtrack is perfect!!!. I love the eclectic mix of music. The movie and the soundtrack deserve recognition. I can't believe how many people have not heard of this movie.

    Stealing Beauty is a character piece, not so much ever really driven by plot, and which makes it a particularly European-flavored entry in the Bernardo Bertolucci cannon of films he's made. This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time. It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at. If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of "will she or won't she" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling. Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work. Lacking really hardcore dramatic tension, it's mostly predicated on a 19-year old girl's quasi-coming-of-age. Which is interesting, up to a point.

    Lucy (played by Liv Tyler) is a 19 American girl which travels to Italy after her mother die. She's coming back to a farmhouse where her mother lived once. It's not the first time she's going there, she had been there four years earlier, so she knows almost everyone in the house. She's young, she's beautiful, she's very attractive, but she's also very innocent and virgin. Every man in the house, from the older to younger, feel her presence and enjoy it, on one or another way, because she's everything but invisible. Her presence is really noticed, but she's not provocative at all. In fact she's very calm and shy. The entire plot is about her, her feelings, people which surround her, and the way she's growing as a woman. It's all that together what makes this movie so beautiful and intimate, because it's a portrait of the fears and hopes, disillusions and happiness, joy and anger of a teenage girl which is having some "feelings" for the very first time. I enjoyed the story but also the settings used, because it's all so peaceful and calm, it's all so quiet in that lost place somewhere in Italy The cinematography is beautiful and has this "special touch" European cinema use to have, with those little details which turn the movie so truthful and realistic. I like it a lot! About the acting I must say I enjoyed especially two characters and the respective actors who played them. They were the character "Lucy", played by Liv Taylor and "Alex", played by Jeremy Irons. It's especially those two characters which make this story so beautiful to me. To sum up, it's a simple but wonderful movie and another excellent work by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    Is this movie about a young girl's search for the truth about her parents? Is it about her yearning to become a woman? Or is it just about sex? I'll leave it to you to decide. Liv Tyler is alluring as the young American who returns to Italy to delve into her mother's mysterious past. Jeremy Irons has little to do as her ailing British confidant, and extra support comes from Joseph Fiennes, Sinead Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Stefania Sandrelli, Jean Marais, D.W. Moffett and Donald McCann. Bertolucci's film, from his own original story, gets its strength from the visual. Art direction is inspired and cinematography is picturesque. Little else uplifts.

    Watching this is like taking a leisurely vacation in the rolling hills of Tuscany. I don't think there's any place in America that has such a sky. The sun seems a misty ochre and the land, where it's not tilled in straight furrows, consists of gravel paths between low stone walls, olive groves, chest-high grape arbors, and dark sturdy oaks. The arbors are populated by hordes of skittery lizards, Lacerta muralis. It's no wonder that summer dinners so often are eaten on long tables al fresco. What an appealing location. And that, maybe, is the principal virtue of Bernardo Bertolucci's "Stealing Beauty." It takes patience and concentration to follow the story closely enough to be engaged by it, and, at heart, there really isn't much to it. A visiting American, the pretty and leggy Liv Tyler, finds out that a local artist is probably her real father, and shortly afterward gives up her virginity to an equally inexperienced local boy. There's a lot of casual conversation, some of which seems to have little point. The function of some characters is a bit obscure. Jeremy Irons, a splendid actor, plays an older man who offers to serve as Liv Tyler's father. He's ill and is finally driven away in an ambulance. An almost unrecognizable Jean Marais is a dotty French visitor. Where do the French get these actors? They're sympatico without being particularly handsome. Jean Gabin, Philippe Noiret. I think I'll exclude Yves Montand because a girl friend once told me he was handsome, and I'm not talking about physical beauty. With Bernardo Bertolucci you generally get some fairly explicit sex, as you do here. There is a party one night. After the guests are exhausted by all that dancing, they retire to engage in sexual activities of various stripes. (Poor Rachel Weisz.) But it's far from soft-core porn. Bertolucci avoids the billowing curtains and candle light clich&eacute;s. There are no fingertips caressing unidentifiable furrows of someone else's body. When the sweet but innocent Italian boy is about to deflower Liv Tyler, he asks, "Can you help me?", and she slides her hand down inside his jeans. It's not exactly a torrid scene, though, and it doesn't end dramatically. The next morning, strolling back to the villa, the kid says that he'd like to follow her to America. She turns and replies, "Do so." And that's that. The kid runs off, waving, and we don't know whether he'll follow her or not, nor do we care anymore than Liv Tyler seems to care. It's in no way a breakthrough film. Bertolucci takes his time and forces us to relax too. There's no violence and no tragedy. I have some trouble imagining most teen-aged kids enjoying this, especially the boys, whose taste and patience have been eroded over the years by exposure to a nimiety of films in which a shoot out with ugly guns has to take place every ten minutes. (Compare the original 1974 "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" with this year's remake, for an example of how esthetic values have devolved.) Liv Tyler gets stung on the arm and the breast by bees, but, you know what? I don't care. I'd like to be among that crowd for a summer. Sure, it would be tough, brushing up on whatever Italian I remember, but I wouldn't have to relearn any of it if Liv Tyler and her legs should come visiting. She speaks surprisingly good English for an American.

    I didn't see this film when it first came out, because I kept reading these terrible reviews. One review has stuck with me, for 12 years. "Liv Tyler is the perfect piece of cardboard." I don't remember who said that, but that line kept me from seeing this film. This film was offered for free on cable on-demand, and since then, I've watched several times. Probably about 20 times. Why do I keep watching it? Because details are revealed each and ever time I see it. Things that I didn't notice before. Liv Tyler gives a very subtle and masterful performance in this film. Her character is experiencing things internally, and it would be inappropriate for her to be wildly expressive. Her character is reacting to her surroundings, but her reactions fall under the radar of normal viewing. The opening scene is shot on (what looks like) digital video by a man on the plane from America to Italy. I didn't notice at first, but, there is a close-up of this man's wrist, wearing a leather bracelet. Fast forward several scenes and this close up of this same bracelet appears on the wrist of this character "Carlo Liska"...and this leads me to believe that the man on the plane was this character "Carlo." But, back to Liv Tyler's character, "Lucy"...this character is a virgin, but that doesn't make her unsophisticated. She speaks Italian, smokes marijuana, and (really forward-thinking for 1996) fearlessly allows a man - a character of a writer (probably dying from AIDS) played by Jeremy Irons, to dress an open, bleeding wound on her knee. AIDS isn't mentioned, but it is implied. Making the subject of sex (circa 1996) that much more shocking. This is a dangerous activity, according to the zeitgeist of the 1990s. Life and death. I like to have this film just playing in the background, because the music is pleasant, and it's pretty much like being on vacation in Tuscany. It isn't a demanding film. It doesn't scream at you. It meanders from beautiful shot to beautiful shot, and having seen it 20 times already, I can leave the room and come back and it's still like a vacation in Tuscany. Naked, beautiful people on the surface, but there's more there if you choose to look.

    This is my favorite movie ever!!! Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast are excellent in this movie. The Tuscan scenery is gorgeous. It makes you wish you were there. I loved the story. The more you watch it the more you love it because you appreciate the surroundings, the music, the beautiful story. The only thing I had a hard time with was the beginning and how it related to the rest of the story. Also, I am usually not a fan of soundtracks, but the Stealing Beauty soundtrack is perfect!!!. I love the eclectic mix of music. The movie and the soundtrack deserve recognition. I can't believe how many people have not heard of this movie.

    Stealing Beauty is a character piece, not so much ever really driven by plot, and which makes it a particularly European-flavored entry in the Bernardo Bertolucci cannon of films he's made. This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time. It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at. If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of "will she or won't she" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling. Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work. Lacking really hardcore dramatic tension, it's mostly predicated on a 19-year old girl's quasi-coming-of-age. Which is interesting, up to a point.

    Lucy (played by Liv Tyler) is a 19 American girl which travels to Italy after her mother die. She's coming back to a farmhouse where her mother lived once. It's not the first time she's going there, she had been there four years earlier, so she knows almost everyone in the house. She's young, she's beautiful, she's very attractive, but she's also very innocent and virgin. Every man in the house, from the older to younger, feel her presence and enjoy it, on one or another way, because she's everything but invisible. Her presence is really noticed, but she's not provocative at all. In fact she's very calm and shy. The entire plot is about her, her feelings, people which surround her, and the way she's growing as a woman. It's all that together what makes this movie so beautiful and intimate, because it's a portrait of the fears and hopes, disillusions and happiness, joy and anger of a teenage girl which is having some "feelings" for the very first time. I enjoyed the story but also the settings used, because it's all so peaceful and calm, it's all so quiet in that lost place somewhere in Italy The cinematography is beautiful and has this "special touch" European cinema use to have, with those little details which turn the movie so truthful and realistic. I like it a lot! About the acting I must say I enjoyed especially two characters and the respective actors who played them. They were the character "Lucy", played by Liv Taylor and "Alex", played by Jeremy Irons. It's especially those two characters which make this story so beautiful to me. To sum up, it's a simple but wonderful movie and another excellent work by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    I saw this movie back in 1998 and I remembered I like it, but watched it again today. It's actually a very good movie and has gorgeous scenery and makes you want to go to Tuscany. There is a lot of nudity of both sexes. Gross. I'm not a prude, I just don't like seeing certain body parts on the big screen. Double gross. Liv Tyler is really beautiful, but I think it takes something away from a movie when you see people's giblets and gravy. I wish that all movies just cut away from that stuff-we know what they are going to do!Anyway, the best scenes are between Liv Tyler and Jeremy Irons. There are a couple of scenes that are very weird-must be very Italian. The best part of the entire movie, however, is the house, its gorgeous. Except the ugly statues everywhere.

    I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie "Stealing Beauty" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called "apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama." I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them. I re-watched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness. This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany. Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, "Enchanting April" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic. Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it. Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. "Stealing Beauty" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.

    Do we leer when we watch films by Bertolucci and Woody Allen? Do you leer? For all their supposed investigation of the celebration of nubile women by middle aged and old men, neither filmmaker quite convinces me that he has quite the interest in these young women that all the artifice, music, flowers, lovely scenery, and other settings suggest. I know that actresses report liking to work with Mr. Allen, as do actors. I am aware that we no longer make that gender distinction but humour me for a moment. Bertolucci has a reputation for pushing actors to full disclosure, as it were. No one discloses anything here. I just saw "Stealing Beauty" for the first time this week during the summer 2012. I find it implausible that a large household of odd mostly male characters would devote a summer contemplating the virginity of a girl. Leering defines, I suppose, a theme for a film as much as any other topic. The loss of virginity seems to me the theme of adolescent films but a bit too much and too little for a film filled with randy old men but these old men seem long past being randy while the young men mostly seem nascent old me without substance. Roger Ebert as usual pins this film in his review. Read it. The men, young and old, lack substance and the nubile girl never becomes a person. Woody Allen usually suggests that the object of desire is a human being and an engaging one at that. Bertolucci does not bother. I rate his film highly because here Bertolucci perfects his leering.

    All the delightful characters, so well developed, and the mystery sub-plot, perhaps help us old fellers feel not so guilty about watching teen Liv Tyler sport about in short, filmy dresses, or less. Yep, she's gorgeous. But where will this movie go? Will it follow its intrigues and conflicts to their resolutions, and thus show that it is more about story than underwear? As the answer to Juicy Lucy's mystery brings us to further interpersonal conflicts, will these be heeded? Unfortunately not. In the postscript to Lolita, Nabakov defines pornography (very soft, and quite pleasant, here) as successive escalations of eroticism to climax. Ultimately, in Stealing Beauty, that escalation takes over, as the director kills all art-house soap opera with the deflowering of his own movie's purported innocence, and with rather sudden ideal romance. Shouldn't we see a bit more flirtation between Lucy and her true love? As in even this softest porn, the rule is that story and character play second fiddle to sex. Story ends when the sculptor tells Lucy, 'This will be our secret.' He doesn't have to tell his wife! His wife isn't even more strongly driven to return to Ireland. Lucy has to continue to pretend she is merely a visitor. Doesn't she want to tell her sister, "You are my half-sister?" All that gets dropped, for a bit of sim-sex, that is supposed to feel like a climax. Oh, yeah, and the three long-distance shots of the villa: It was a little disconcerting to keep seeing Gladiator Maximus's villa, supposedly in Spain, here in Tuscany. But for a place 2000 years old, it was well preserved.

There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at. If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of "will she or won't she" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling. Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work. Lacking really hardcore dramatic tension, it's mostly predicated on a 19-year old girl's quasi-coming-of-age. Which is interesting, up to a point.

    Lucy (played by Liv Tyler) is a 19 American girl which travels to Italy after her mother die. She's coming back to a farmhouse where her mother lived once. It's not the first time she's going there, she had been there four years earlier, so she knows almost everyone in the house. She's young, she's beautiful, she's very attractive, but she's also very innocent and virgin. Every man in the house, from the older to younger, feel her presence and enjoy it, on one or another way, because she's everything but invisible. Her presence is really noticed, but she's not provocative at all. In fact she's very calm and shy. The entire plot is about her, her feelings, people which surround her, and the way she's growing as a woman. It's all that together what makes this movie so beautiful and intimate, because it's a portrait of the fears and hopes, disillusions and happiness, joy and anger of a teenage girl which is having some "feelings" for the very first time. I enjoyed the story but also the settings used, because it's all so peaceful and calm, it's all so quiet in that lost place somewhere in Italy The cinematography is beautiful and has this "special touch" European cinema use to have, with those little details which turn the movie so truthful and realistic. I like it a lot! About the acting I must say I enjoyed especially two characters and the respective actors who played them. They were the character "Lucy", played by Liv Taylor and "Alex", played by Jeremy Irons. It's especially those two characters which make this story so beautiful to me. To sum up, it's a simple but wonderful movie and another excellent work by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    I saw this movie back in 1998 and I remembered I like it, but watched it again today. It's actually a very good movie and has gorgeous scenery and makes you want to go to Tuscany. There is a lot of nudity of both sexes. Gross. I'm not a prude, I just don't like seeing certain body parts on the big screen. Double gross. Liv Tyler is really beautiful, but I think it takes something away from a movie when you see people's giblets and gravy. I wish that all movies just cut away from that stuff-we know what they are going to do!Anyway, the best scenes are between Liv Tyler and Jeremy Irons. There are a couple of scenes that are very weird-must be very Italian. The best part of the entire movie, however, is the house, its gorgeous. Except the ugly statues everywhere.

    I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie "Stealing Beauty" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called "apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama." I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them. I re-watched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness. This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany. Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, "Enchanting April" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic. Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it. Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. "Stealing Beauty" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.

    Do we leer when we watch films by Bertolucci and Woody Allen? Do you leer? For all their supposed investigation of the celebration of nubile women by middle aged and old men, neither filmmaker quite convinces me that he has quite the interest in these young women that all the artifice, music, flowers, lovely scenery, and other settings suggest. I know that actresses report liking to work with Mr. Allen, as do actors. I am aware that we no longer make that gender distinction but humour me for a moment. Bertolucci has a reputation for pushing actors to full disclosure, as it were. No one discloses anything here. I just saw "Stealing Beauty" for the first time this week during the summer 2012. I find it implausible that a large household of odd mostly male characters would devote a summer contemplating the virginity of a girl. Leering defines, I suppose, a theme for a film as much as any other topic. The loss of virginity seems to me the theme of adolescent films but a bit too much and too little for a film filled with randy old men but these old men seem long past being randy while the young men mostly seem nascent old me without substance. Roger Ebert as usual pins this film in his review. Read it. The men, young and old, lack substance and the nubile girl never becomes a person. Woody Allen usually suggests that the object of desire is a human being and an engaging one at that. Bertolucci does not bother. I rate his film highly because here Bertolucci perfects his leering.

    All the delightful characters, so well developed, and the mystery sub-plot, perhaps help us old fellers feel not so guilty about watching teen Liv Tyler sport about in short, filmy dresses, or less. Yep, she's gorgeous. But where will this movie go? Will it follow its intrigues and conflicts to their resolutions, and thus show that it is more about story than underwear? As the answer to Juicy Lucy's mystery brings us to further interpersonal conflicts, will these be heeded? Unfortunately not. In the postscript to Lolita, Nabakov defines pornography (very soft, and quite pleasant, here) as successive escalations of eroticism to climax. Ultimately, in Stealing Beauty, that escalation takes over, as the director kills all art-house soap opera with the deflowering of his own movie's purported innocence, and with rather sudden ideal romance. Shouldn't we see a bit more flirtation between Lucy and her true love? As in even this softest porn, the rule is that story and character play second fiddle to sex. Story ends when the sculptor tells Lucy, 'This will be our secret.' He doesn't have to tell his wife! His wife isn't even more strongly driven to return to Ireland. Lucy has to continue to pretend she is merely a visitor. Doesn't she want to tell her sister, "You are my half-sister?" All that gets dropped, for a bit of sim-sex, that is supposed to feel like a climax. Oh, yeah, and the three long-distance shots of the villa: It was a little disconcerting to keep seeing Gladiator Maximus's villa, supposedly in Spain, here in Tuscany. But for a place 2000 years old, it was well preserved.

    Is this movie about a young girl's search for the truth about her parents? Is it about her yearning to become a woman? Or is it just about sex? I'll leave it to you to decide. Liv Tyler is alluring as the young American who returns to Italy to delve into her mother's mysterious past. Jeremy Irons has little to do as her ailing British confidant, and extra support comes from Joseph Fiennes, Sinead Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Stefania Sandrelli, Jean Marais, D.W. Moffett and Donald McCann. Bertolucci's film, from his own original story, gets its strength from the visual. Art direction is inspired and cinematography is picturesque. Little else uplifts.

    Watching this is like taking a leisurely vacation in the rolling hills of Tuscany. I don't think there's any place in America that has such a sky. The sun seems a misty ochre and the land, where it's not tilled in straight furrows, consists of gravel paths between low stone walls, olive groves, chest-high grape arbors, and dark sturdy oaks. The arbors are populated by hordes of skittery lizards, Lacerta muralis. It's no wonder that summer dinners so often are eaten on long tables al fresco. What an appealing location. And that, maybe, is the principal virtue of Bernardo Bertolucci's "Stealing Beauty." It takes patience and concentration to follow the story closely enough to be engaged by it, and, at heart, there really isn't much to it. A visiting American, the pretty and leggy Liv Tyler, finds out that a local artist is probably her real father, and shortly afterward gives up her virginity to an equally inexperienced local boy. There's a lot of casual conversation, some of which seems to have little point. The function of some characters is a bit obscure. Jeremy Irons, a splendid actor, plays an older man who offers to serve as Liv Tyler's father. He's ill and is finally driven away in an ambulance. An almost unrecognizable Jean Marais is a dotty French visitor. Where do the French get these actors? They're sympatico without being particularly handsome. Jean Gabin, Philippe Noiret. I think I'll exclude Yves Montand because a girl friend once told me he was handsome, and I'm not talking about physical beauty. With Bernardo Bertolucci you generally get some fairly explicit sex, as you do here. There is a party one night. After the guests are exhausted by all that dancing, they retire to engage in sexual activities of various stripes. (Poor Rachel Weisz.) But it's far from soft-core porn. Bertolucci avoids the billowing curtains and candle light clich&eacute;s. There are no fingertips caressing unidentifiable furrows of someone else's body. When the sweet but innocent Italian boy is about to deflower Liv Tyler, he asks, "Can you help me?", and she slides her hand down inside his jeans. It's not exactly a torrid scene, though, and it doesn't end dramatically. The next morning, strolling back to the villa, the kid says that he'd like to follow her to America. She turns and replies, "Do so." And that's that. The kid runs off, waving, and we don't know whether he'll follow her or not, nor do we care anymore than Liv Tyler seems to care. It's in no way a breakthrough film. Bertolucci takes his time and forces us to relax too. There's no violence and no tragedy. I have some trouble imagining most teen-aged kids enjoying this, especially the boys, whose taste and patience have been eroded over the years by exposure to a nimiety of films in which a shoot out with ugly guns has to take place every ten minutes. (Compare the original 1974 "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" with this year's remake, for an example of how esthetic values have devolved.) Liv Tyler gets stung on the arm and the breast by bees, but, you know what? I don't care. I'd like to be among that crowd for a summer. Sure, it would be tough, brushing up on whatever Italian I remember, but I wouldn't have to relearn any of it if Liv Tyler and her legs should come visiting. She speaks surprisingly good English for an American.

    I didn't see this film when it first came out, because I kept reading these terrible reviews. One review has stuck with me, for 12 years. "Liv Tyler is the perfect piece of cardboard." I don't remember who said that, but that line kept me from seeing this film. This film was offered for free on cable on-demand, and since then, I've watched several times. Probably about 20 times. Why do I keep watching it? Because details are revealed each and ever time I see it. Things that I didn't notice before. Liv Tyler gives a very subtle and masterful performance in this film. Her character is experiencing things internally, and it would be inappropriate for her to be wildly expressive. Her character is reacting to her surroundings, but her reactions fall under the radar of normal viewing. The opening scene is shot on (what looks like) digital video by a man on the plane from America to Italy. I didn't notice at first, but, there is a close-up of this man's wrist, wearing a leather bracelet. Fast forward several scenes and this close up of this same bracelet appears on the wrist of this character "Carlo Liska"...and this leads me to believe that the man on the plane was this character "Carlo." But, back to Liv Tyler's character, "Lucy"...this character is a virgin, but that doesn't make her unsophisticated. She speaks Italian, smokes marijuana, and (really forward-thinking for 1996) fearlessly allows a man - a character of a writer (probably dying from AIDS) played by Jeremy Irons, to dress an open, bleeding wound on her knee. AIDS isn't mentioned, but it is implied. Making the subject of sex (circa 1996) that much more shocking. This is a dangerous activity, according to the zeitgeist of the 1990s. Life and death. I like to have this film just playing in the background, because the music is pleasant, and it's pretty much like being on vacation in Tuscany. It isn't a demanding film. It doesn't scream at you. It meanders from beautiful shot to beautiful shot, and having seen it 20 times already, I can leave the room and come back and it's still like a vacation in Tuscany. Naked, beautiful people on the surface, but there's more there if you choose to look.

    This is my favorite movie ever!!! Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast are excellent in this movie. The Tuscan scenery is gorgeous. It makes you wish you were there. I loved the story. The more you watch it the more you love it because you appreciate the surroundings, the music, the beautiful story. The only thing I had a hard time with was the beginning and how it related to the rest of the story. Also, I am usually not a fan of soundtracks, but the Stealing Beauty soundtrack is perfect!!!. I love the eclectic mix of music. The movie and the soundtrack deserve recognition. I can't believe how many people have not heard of this movie.

    Stealing Beauty is a character piece, not so much ever really driven by plot, and which makes it a particularly European-flavored entry in the Bernardo Bertolucci cannon of films he's made. This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time. It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at. If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of "will she or won't she" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes.

    All the delightful characters, so well developed, and the mystery sub-plot, perhaps help us old fellers feel not so guilty about watching teen Liv Tyler sport about in short, filmy dresses, or less. Yep, she's gorgeous. But where will this movie go? Will it follow its intrigues and conflicts to their resolutions, and thus show that it is more about story than underwear? As the answer to Juicy Lucy's mystery brings us to further interpersonal conflicts, will these be heeded? Unfortunately not. In the postscript to Lolita, Nabakov defines pornography (very soft, and quite pleasant, here) as successive escalations of eroticism to climax. Ultimately, in Stealing Beauty, that escalation takes over, as the director kills all art-house soap opera with the deflowering of his own movie's purported innocence, and with rather sudden ideal romance. Shouldn't we see a bit more flirtation between Lucy and her true love? As in even this softest porn, the rule is that story and character play second fiddle to sex. Story ends when the sculptor tells Lucy, 'This will be our secret.' He doesn't have to tell his wife! His wife isn't even more strongly driven to return to Ireland. Lucy has to continue to pretend she is merely a visitor. Doesn't she want to tell her sister, "You are my half-sister?" All that gets dropped, for a bit of sim-sex, that is supposed to feel like a climax. Oh, yeah, and the three long-distance shots of the villa: It was a little disconcerting to keep seeing Gladiator Maximus's villa, supposedly in Spain, here in Tuscany. But for a place 2000 years old, it was well preserved.

    Is this movie about a young girl's search for the truth about her parents? Is it about her yearning to become a woman? Or is it just about sex? I'll leave it to you to decide. Liv Tyler is alluring as the young American who returns to Italy to delve into her mother's mysterious past. Jeremy Irons has little to do as her ailing British confidant, and extra support comes from Joseph Fiennes, Sinead Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Stefania Sandrelli, Jean Marais, D.W. Moffett and Donald McCann. Bertolucci's film, from his own original story, gets its strength from the visual. Art direction is inspired and cinematography is picturesque. Little else uplifts.

    Watching this is like taking a leisurely vacation in the rolling hills of Tuscany. I don't think there's any place in America that has such a sky. The sun seems a misty ochre and the land, where it's not tilled in straight furrows, consists of gravel paths between low stone walls, olive groves, chest-high grape arbors, and dark sturdy oaks. The arbors are populated by hordes of skittery lizards, Lacerta muralis. It's no wonder that summer dinners so often are eaten on long tables al fresco. What an appealing location. And that, maybe, is the principal virtue of Bernardo Bertolucci's "Stealing Beauty." It takes patience and concentration to follow the story closely enough to be engaged by it, and, at heart, there really isn't much to it. A visiting American, the pretty and leggy Liv Tyler, finds out that a local artist is probably her real father, and shortly afterward gives up her virginity to an equally inexperienced local boy. There's a lot of casual conversation, some of which seems to have little point. The function of some characters is a bit obscure. Jeremy Irons, a splendid actor, plays an older man who offers to serve as Liv Tyler's father. He's ill and is finally driven away in an ambulance. An almost unrecognizable Jean Marais is a dotty French visitor. Where do the French get these actors? They're sympatico without being particularly handsome. Jean Gabin, Philippe Noiret. I think I'll exclude Yves Montand because a girl friend once told me he was handsome, and I'm not talking about physical beauty. With Bernardo Bertolucci you generally get some fairly explicit sex, as you do here. There is a party one night. After the guests are exhausted by all that dancing, they retire to engage in sexual activities of various stripes. (Poor Rachel Weisz.) But it's far from soft-core porn. Bertolucci avoids the billowing curtains and candle light clich&eacute;s. There are no fingertips caressing unidentifiable furrows of someone else's body. When the sweet but innocent Italian boy is about to deflower Liv Tyler, he asks, "Can you help me?", and she slides her hand down inside his jeans. It's not exactly a torrid scene, though, and it doesn't end dramatically. The next morning, strolling back to the villa, the kid says that he'd like to follow her to America. She turns and replies, "Do so." And that's that. The kid runs off, waving, and we don't know whether he'll follow her or not, nor do we care anymore than Liv Tyler seems to care. It's in no way a breakthrough film. Bertolucci takes his time and forces us to relax too. There's no violence and no tragedy. I have some trouble imagining most teen-aged kids enjoying this, especially the boys, whose taste and patience have been eroded over the years by exposure to a nimiety of films in which a shoot out with ugly guns has to take place every ten minutes. (Compare the original 1974 "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" with this year's remake, for an example of how esthetic values have devolved.) Liv Tyler gets stung on the arm and the breast by bees, but, you know what? I don't care. I'd like to be among that crowd for a summer. Sure, it would be tough, brushing up on whatever Italian I remember, but I wouldn't have to relearn any of it if Liv Tyler and her legs should come visiting. She speaks surprisingly good English for an American.

    I didn't see this film when it first came out, because I kept reading these terrible reviews. One review has stuck with me, for 12 years. "Liv Tyler is the perfect piece of cardboard." I don't remember who said that, but that line kept me from seeing this film. This film was offered for free on cable on-demand, and since then, I've watched several times. Probably about 20 times. Why do I keep watching it? Because details are revealed each and ever time I see it. Things that I didn't notice before. Liv Tyler gives a very subtle and masterful performance in this film. Her character is experiencing things internally, and it would be inappropriate for her to be wildly expressive. Her character is reacting to her surroundings, but her reactions fall under the radar of normal viewing. The opening scene is shot on (what looks like) digital video by a man on the plane from America to Italy. I didn't notice at first, but, there is a close-up of this man's wrist, wearing a leather bracelet. Fast forward several scenes and this close up of this same bracelet appears on the wrist of this character "Carlo Liska"...and this leads me to believe that the man on the plane was this character "Carlo." But, back to Liv Tyler's character, "Lucy"...this character is a virgin, but that doesn't make her unsophisticated. She speaks Italian, smokes marijuana, and (really forward-thinking for 1996) fearlessly allows a man - a character of a writer (probably dying from AIDS) played by Jeremy Irons, to dress an open, bleeding wound on her knee. AIDS isn't mentioned, but it is implied. Making the subject of sex (circa 1996) that much more shocking. This is a dangerous activity, according to the zeitgeist of the 1990s. Life and death. I like to have this film just playing in the background, because the music is pleasant, and it's pretty much like being on vacation in Tuscany. It isn't a demanding film. It doesn't scream at you. It meanders from beautiful shot to beautiful shot, and having seen it 20 times already, I can leave the room and come back and it's still like a vacation in Tuscany. Naked, beautiful people on the surface, but there's more there if you choose to look.

I loved the story. The more you watch it the more you love it because you appreciate the surroundings, the music, the beautiful story. The only thing I had a hard time with was the beginning and how it related to the rest of the story. Also, I am usually not a fan of soundtracks, but the Stealing Beauty soundtrack is perfect!!!. I love the eclectic mix of music. The movie and the soundtrack deserve recognition. I can't believe how many people have not heard of this movie.

    Stealing Beauty is a character piece, not so much ever really driven by plot, and which makes it a particularly European-flavored entry in the Bernardo Bertolucci cannon of films he's made. This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time. It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at. If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of "will she or won't she" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling. Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work. Lacking really hardcore dramatic tension, it's mostly predicated on a 19-year old girl's quasi-coming-of-age. Which is interesting, up to a point.

    Lucy (played by Liv Tyler) is a 19 American girl which travels to Italy after her mother die. She's coming back to a farmhouse where her mother lived once. It's not the first time she's going there, she had been there four years earlier, so she knows almost everyone in the house. She's young, she's beautiful, she's very attractive, but she's also very innocent and virgin. Every man in the house, from the older to younger, feel her presence and enjoy it, on one or another way, because she's everything but invisible. Her presence is really noticed, but she's not provocative at all. In fact she's very calm and shy. The entire plot is about her, her feelings, people which surround her, and the way she's growing as a woman. It's all that together what makes this movie so beautiful and intimate, because it's a portrait of the fears and hopes, disillusions and happiness, joy and anger of a teenage girl which is having some "feelings" for the very first time. I enjoyed the story but also the settings used, because it's all so peaceful and calm, it's all so quiet in that lost place somewhere in Italy The cinematography is beautiful and has this "special touch" European cinema use to have, with those little details which turn the movie so truthful and realistic. I like it a lot! About the acting I must say I enjoyed especially two characters and the respective actors who played them. They were the character "Lucy", played by Liv Taylor and "Alex", played by Jeremy Irons. It's especially those two characters which make this story so beautiful to me. To sum up, it's a simple but wonderful movie and another excellent work by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    I saw this movie back in 1998 and I remembered I like it, but watched it again today. It's actually a very good movie and has gorgeous scenery and makes you want to go to Tuscany. There is a lot of nudity of both sexes. Gross. I'm not a prude, I just don't like seeing certain body parts on the big screen. Double gross. Liv Tyler is really beautiful, but I think it takes something away from a movie when you see people's giblets and gravy. I wish that all movies just cut away from that stuff-we know what they are going to do!Anyway, the best scenes are between Liv Tyler and Jeremy Irons. There are a couple of scenes that are very weird-must be very Italian. The best part of the entire movie, however, is the house, its gorgeous. Except the ugly statues everywhere.

    I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie "Stealing Beauty" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called "apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama." I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them. I re-watched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness. This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany. Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, "Enchanting April" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic. Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it. Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. "Stealing Beauty" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.

    Do we leer when we watch films by Bertolucci and Woody Allen? Do you leer? For all their supposed investigation of the celebration of nubile women by middle aged and old men, neither filmmaker quite convinces me that he has quite the interest in these young women that all the artifice, music, flowers, lovely scenery, and other settings suggest. I know that actresses report liking to work with Mr. Allen, as do actors. I am aware that we no longer make that gender distinction but humour me for a moment. Bertolucci has a reputation for pushing actors to full disclosure, as it were. No one discloses anything here. I just saw "Stealing Beauty" for the first time this week during the summer 2012. I find it implausible that a large household of odd mostly male characters would devote a summer contemplating the virginity of a girl. Leering defines, I suppose, a theme for a film as much as any other topic. The loss of virginity seems to me the theme of adolescent films but a bit too much and too little for a film filled with randy old men but these old men seem long past being randy while the young men mostly seem nascent old me without substance. Roger Ebert as usual pins this film in his review. Read it. The men, young and old, lack substance and the nubile girl never becomes a person. Woody Allen usually suggests that the object of desire is a human being and an engaging one at that. Bertolucci does not bother. I rate his film highly because here Bertolucci perfects his leering.

    Stealing Beauty is a character piece, not so much ever really driven by plot, and which makes it a particularly European-flavored entry in the Bernardo Bertolucci cannon of films he's made. This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time. It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at. If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of "will she or won't she" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling. Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work. Lacking really hardcore dramatic tension, it's mostly predicated on a 19-year old girl's quasi-coming-of-age. Which is interesting, up to a point.

    Lucy (played by Liv Tyler) is a 19 American girl which travels to Italy after her mother die. She's coming back to a farmhouse where her mother lived once. It's not the first time she's going there, she had been there four years earlier, so she knows almost everyone in the house. She's young, she's beautiful, she's very attractive, but she's also very innocent and virgin. Every man in the house, from the older to younger, feel her presence and enjoy it, on one or another way, because she's everything but invisible. Her presence is really noticed, but she's not provocative at all. In fact she's very calm and shy. The entire plot is about her, her feelings, people which surround her, and the way she's growing as a woman. It's all that together what makes this movie so beautiful and intimate, because it's a portrait of the fears and hopes, disillusions and happiness, joy and anger of a teenage girl which is having some "feelings" for the very first time. I enjoyed the story but also the settings used, because it's all so peaceful and calm, it's all so quiet in that lost place somewhere in Italy The cinematography is beautiful and has this "special touch" European cinema use to have, with those little details which turn the movie so truthful and realistic. I like it a lot! About the acting I must say I enjoyed especially two characters and the respective actors who played them. They were the character "Lucy", played by Liv Taylor and "Alex", played by Jeremy Irons. It's especially those two characters which make this story so beautiful to me. To sum up, it's a simple but wonderful movie and another excellent work by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    I saw this movie back in 1998 and I remembered I like it, but watched it again today. It's actually a very good movie and has gorgeous scenery and makes you want to go to Tuscany. There is a lot of nudity of both sexes. Gross. I'm not a prude, I just don't like seeing certain body parts on the big screen. Double gross. Liv Tyler is really beautiful, but I think it takes something away from a movie when you see people's giblets and gravy. I wish that all movies just cut away from that stuff-we know what they are going to do!Anyway, the best scenes are between Liv Tyler and Jeremy Irons. There are a couple of scenes that are very weird-must be very Italian. The best part of the entire movie, however, is the house, its gorgeous. Except the ugly statues everywhere.

    I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie "Stealing Beauty" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called "apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama." I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them. I re-watched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness. This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany. Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, "Enchanting April" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic. Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it. Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. "Stealing Beauty" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.

    Do we leer when we watch films by Bertolucci and Woody Allen? Do you leer? For all their supposed investigation of the celebration of nubile women by middle aged and old men, neither filmmaker quite convinces me that he has quite the interest in these young women that all the artifice, music, flowers, lovely scenery, and other settings suggest. I know that actresses report liking to work with Mr. Allen, as do actors. I am aware that we no longer make that gender distinction but humour me for a moment. Bertolucci has a reputation for pushing actors to full disclosure, as it were. No one discloses anything here. I just saw "Stealing Beauty" for the first time this week during the summer 2012. I find it implausible that a large household of odd mostly male characters would devote a summer contemplating the virginity of a girl. Leering defines, I suppose, a theme for a film as much as any other topic. The loss of virginity seems to me the theme of adolescent films but a bit too much and too little for a film filled with randy old men but these old men seem long past being randy while the young men mostly seem nascent old me without substance. Roger Ebert as usual pins this film in his review. Read it. The men, young and old, lack substance and the nubile girl never becomes a person. Woody Allen usually suggests that the object of desire is a human being and an engaging one at that. Bertolucci does not bother. I rate his film highly because here Bertolucci perfects his leering.

    All the delightful characters, so well developed, and the mystery sub-plot, perhaps help us old fellers feel not so guilty about watching teen Liv Tyler sport about in short, filmy dresses, or less. Yep, she's gorgeous. But where will this movie go? Will it follow its intrigues and conflicts to their resolutions, and thus show that it is more about story than underwear? As the answer to Juicy Lucy's mystery brings us to further interpersonal conflicts, will these be heeded? Unfortunately not. In the postscript to Lolita, Nabakov defines pornography (very soft, and quite pleasant, here) as successive escalations of eroticism to climax. Ultimately, in Stealing Beauty, that escalation takes over, as the director kills all art-house soap opera with the deflowering of his own movie's purported innocence, and with rather sudden ideal romance. Shouldn't we see a bit more flirtation between Lucy and her true love? As in even this softest porn, the rule is that story and character play second fiddle to sex. Story ends when the sculptor tells Lucy, 'This will be our secret.' He doesn't have to tell his wife! His wife isn't even more strongly driven to return to Ireland. Lucy has to continue to pretend she is merely a visitor. Doesn't she want to tell her sister, "You are my half-sister?" All that gets dropped, for a bit of sim-sex, that is supposed to feel like a climax. Oh, yeah, and the three long-distance shots of the villa: It was a little disconcerting to keep seeing Gladiator Maximus's villa, supposedly in Spain, here in Tuscany. But for a place 2000 years old, it was well preserved.

    Is this movie about a young girl's search for the truth about her parents? Is it about her yearning to become a woman? Or is it just about sex? I'll leave it to you to decide. Liv Tyler is alluring as the young American who returns to Italy to delve into her mother's mysterious past. Jeremy Irons has little to do as her ailing British confidant, and extra support comes from Joseph Fiennes, Sinead Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Stefania Sandrelli, Jean Marais, D.W. Moffett and Donald McCann. Bertolucci's film, from his own original story, gets its strength from the visual. Art direction is inspired and cinematography is picturesque. Little else uplifts.

    Watching this is like taking a leisurely vacation in the rolling hills of Tuscany. I don't think there's any place in America that has such a sky. The sun seems a misty ochre and the land, where it's not tilled in straight furrows, consists of gravel paths between low stone walls, olive groves, chest-high grape arbors, and dark sturdy oaks. The arbors are populated by hordes of skittery lizards, Lacerta muralis. It's no wonder that summer dinners so often are eaten on long tables al fresco. What an appealing location. And that, maybe, is the principal virtue of Bernardo Bertolucci's "Stealing Beauty." It takes patience and concentration to follow the story closely enough to be engaged by it, and, at heart, there really isn't much to it. A visiting American, the pretty and leggy Liv Tyler, finds out that a local artist is probably her real father, and shortly afterward gives up her virginity to an equally inexperienced local boy. There's a lot of casual conversation, some of which seems to have little point. The function of some characters is a bit obscure. Jeremy Irons, a splendid actor, plays an older man who offers to serve as Liv Tyler's father. He's ill and is finally driven away in an ambulance. An almost unrecognizable Jean Marais is a dotty French visitor. Where do the French get these actors? They're sympatico without being particularly handsome. Jean Gabin, Philippe Noiret. I think I'll exclude Yves Montand because a girl friend once told me he was handsome, and I'm not talking about physical beauty. With Bernardo Bertolucci you generally get some fairly explicit sex, as you do here. There is a party one night. After the guests are exhausted by all that dancing, they retire to engage in sexual activities of various stripes. (Poor Rachel Weisz.) But it's far from soft-core porn. Bertolucci avoids the billowing curtains and candle light clich&eacute;s. There are no fingertips caressing unidentifiable furrows of someone else's body. When the sweet but innocent Italian boy is about to deflower Liv Tyler, he asks, "Can you help me?", and she slides her hand down inside his jeans. It's not exactly a torrid scene, though, and it doesn't end dramatically. The next morning, strolling back to the villa, the kid says that he'd like to follow her to America. She turns and replies, "Do so." And that's that. The kid runs off, waving, and we don't know whether he'll follow her or not, nor do we care anymore than Liv Tyler seems to care. It's in no way a breakthrough film. Bertolucci takes his time and forces us to relax too. There's no violence and no tragedy. I have some trouble imagining most teen-aged kids enjoying this, especially the boys, whose taste and patience have been eroded over the years by exposure to a nimiety of films in which a shoot out with ugly guns has to take place every ten minutes. (Compare the original 1974 "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" with this year's remake, for an example of how esthetic values have devolved.) Liv Tyler gets stung on the arm and the breast by bees, but, you know what? I don't care. I'd like to be among that crowd for a summer. Sure, it would be tough, brushing up on whatever Italian I remember, but I wouldn't have to relearn any of it if Liv Tyler and her legs should come visiting. She speaks surprisingly good English for an American.

    I didn't see this film when it first came out, because I kept reading these terrible reviews. One review has stuck with me, for 12 years. "Liv Tyler is the perfect piece of cardboard." I don't remember who said that, but that line kept me from seeing this film. This film was offered for free on cable on-demand, and since then, I've watched several times. Probably about 20 times. Why do I keep watching it? Because details are revealed each and ever time I see it. Things that I didn't notice before. Liv Tyler gives a very subtle and masterful performance in this film. Her character is experiencing things internally, and it would be inappropriate for her to be wildly expressive. Her character is reacting to her surroundings, but her reactions fall under the radar of normal viewing. The opening scene is shot on (what looks like) digital video by a man on the plane from America to Italy. I didn't notice at first, but, there is a close-up of this man's wrist, wearing a leather bracelet. Fast forward several scenes and this close up of this same bracelet appears on the wrist of this character "Carlo Liska"...and this leads me to believe that the man on the plane was this character "Carlo." But, back to Liv Tyler's character, "Lucy"...this character is a virgin, but that doesn't make her unsophisticated. She speaks Italian, smokes marijuana, and (really forward-thinking for 1996) fearlessly allows a man - a character of a writer (probably dying from AIDS) played by Jeremy Irons, to dress an open, bleeding wound on her knee. AIDS isn't mentioned, but it is implied. Making the subject of sex (circa 1996) that much more shocking. This is a dangerous activity, according to the zeitgeist of the 1990s. Life and death. I like to have this film just playing in the background, because the music is pleasant, and it's pretty much like being on vacation in Tuscany. It isn't a demanding film. It doesn't scream at you. It meanders from beautiful shot to beautiful shot, and having seen it 20 times already, I can leave the room and come back and it's still like a vacation in Tuscany. Naked, beautiful people on the surface, but there's more there if you choose to look.

    This is my favorite movie ever!!! Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast are excellent in this movie. The Tuscan scenery is gorgeous. It makes you wish you were there. I loved the story. The more you watch it the more you love it because you appreciate the surroundings, the music, the beautiful story. The only thing I had a hard time with was the beginning and how it related to the rest of the story. Also, I am usually not a fan of soundtracks, but the Stealing Beauty soundtrack is perfect!!!. I love the eclectic mix of music. The movie and the soundtrack deserve recognition. I can't believe how many people have not heard of this movie.

Bertolucci has a reputation for pushing actors to full disclosure, as it were. No one discloses anything here. I just saw "Stealing Beauty" for the first time this week during the summer 2012. I find it implausible that a large household of odd mostly male characters would devote a summer contemplating the virginity of a girl. Leering defines, I suppose, a theme for a film as much as any other topic. The loss of virginity seems to me the theme of adolescent films but a bit too much and too little for a film filled with randy old men but these old men seem long past being randy while the young men mostly seem nascent old me without substance. Roger Ebert as usual pins this film in his review. Read it. The men, young and old, lack substance and the nubile girl never becomes a person. Woody Allen usually suggests that the object of desire is a human being and an engaging one at that. Bertolucci does not bother. I rate his film highly because here Bertolucci perfects his leering.

    All the delightful characters, so well developed, and the mystery sub-plot, perhaps help us old fellers feel not so guilty about watching teen Liv Tyler sport about in short, filmy dresses, or less. Yep, she's gorgeous. But where will this movie go? Will it follow its intrigues and conflicts to their resolutions, and thus show that it is more about story than underwear? As the answer to Juicy Lucy's mystery brings us to further interpersonal conflicts, will these be heeded? Unfortunately not. In the postscript to Lolita, Nabakov defines pornography (very soft, and quite pleasant, here) as successive escalations of eroticism to climax. Ultimately, in Stealing Beauty, that escalation takes over, as the director kills all art-house soap opera with the deflowering of his own movie's purported innocence, and with rather sudden ideal romance. Shouldn't we see a bit more flirtation between Lucy and her true love? As in even this softest porn, the rule is that story and character play second fiddle to sex. Story ends when the sculptor tells Lucy, 'This will be our secret.' He doesn't have to tell his wife! His wife isn't even more strongly driven to return to Ireland. Lucy has to continue to pretend she is merely a visitor. Doesn't she want to tell her sister, "You are my half-sister?" All that gets dropped, for a bit of sim-sex, that is supposed to feel like a climax. Oh, yeah, and the three long-distance shots of the villa: It was a little disconcerting to keep seeing Gladiator Maximus's villa, supposedly in Spain, here in Tuscany. But for a place 2000 years old, it was well preserved.

    Is this movie about a young girl's search for the truth about her parents? Is it about her yearning to become a woman? Or is it just about sex? I'll leave it to you to decide. Liv Tyler is alluring as the young American who returns to Italy to delve into her mother's mysterious past. Jeremy Irons has little to do as her ailing British confidant, and extra support comes from Joseph Fiennes, Sinead Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Stefania Sandrelli, Jean Marais, D.W. Moffett and Donald McCann. Bertolucci's film, from his own original story, gets its strength from the visual. Art direction is inspired and cinematography is picturesque. Little else uplifts.

    Watching this is like taking a leisurely vacation in the rolling hills of Tuscany. I don't think there's any place in America that has such a sky. The sun seems a misty ochre and the land, where it's not tilled in straight furrows, consists of gravel paths between low stone walls, olive groves, chest-high grape arbors, and dark sturdy oaks. The arbors are populated by hordes of skittery lizards, Lacerta muralis. It's no wonder that summer dinners so often are eaten on long tables al fresco. What an appealing location. And that, maybe, is the principal virtue of Bernardo Bertolucci's "Stealing Beauty." It takes patience and concentration to follow the story closely enough to be engaged by it, and, at heart, there really isn't much to it. A visiting American, the pretty and leggy Liv Tyler, finds out that a local artist is probably her real father, and shortly afterward gives up her virginity to an equally inexperienced local boy. There's a lot of casual conversation, some of which seems to have little point. The function of some characters is a bit obscure. Jeremy Irons, a splendid actor, plays an older man who offers to serve as Liv Tyler's father. He's ill and is finally driven away in an ambulance. An almost unrecognizable Jean Marais is a dotty French visitor. Where do the French get these actors? They're sympatico without being particularly handsome. Jean Gabin, Philippe Noiret. I think I'll exclude Yves Montand because a girl friend once told me he was handsome, and I'm not talking about physical beauty. With Bernardo Bertolucci you generally get some fairly explicit sex, as you do here. There is a party one night. After the guests are exhausted by all that dancing, they retire to engage in sexual activities of various stripes. (Poor Rachel Weisz.) But it's far from soft-core porn. Bertolucci avoids the billowing curtains and candle light clich&eacute;s. There are no fingertips caressing unidentifiable furrows of someone else's body. When the sweet but innocent Italian boy is about to deflower Liv Tyler, he asks, "Can you help me?", and she slides her hand down inside his jeans. It's not exactly a torrid scene, though, and it doesn't end dramatically. The next morning, strolling back to the villa, the kid says that he'd like to follow her to America. She turns and replies, "Do so." And that's that. The kid runs off, waving, and we don't know whether he'll follow her or not, nor do we care anymore than Liv Tyler seems to care. It's in no way a breakthrough film. Bertolucci takes his time and forces us to relax too. There's no violence and no tragedy. I have some trouble imagining most teen-aged kids enjoying this, especially the boys, whose taste and patience have been eroded over the years by exposure to a nimiety of films in which a shoot out with ugly guns has to take place every ten minutes. (Compare the original 1974 "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" with this year's remake, for an example of how esthetic values have devolved.) Liv Tyler gets stung on the arm and the breast by bees, but, you know what? I don't care. I'd like to be among that crowd for a summer. Sure, it would be tough, brushing up on whatever Italian I remember, but I wouldn't have to relearn any of it if Liv Tyler and her legs should come visiting. She speaks surprisingly good English for an American.

    I didn't see this film when it first came out, because I kept reading these terrible reviews. One review has stuck with me, for 12 years. "Liv Tyler is the perfect piece of cardboard." I don't remember who said that, but that line kept me from seeing this film. This film was offered for free on cable on-demand, and since then, I've watched several times. Probably about 20 times. Why do I keep watching it? Because details are revealed each and ever time I see it. Things that I didn't notice before. Liv Tyler gives a very subtle and masterful performance in this film. Her character is experiencing things internally, and it would be inappropriate for her to be wildly expressive. Her character is reacting to her surroundings, but her reactions fall under the radar of normal viewing. The opening scene is shot on (what looks like) digital video by a man on the plane from America to Italy. I didn't notice at first, but, there is a close-up of this man's wrist, wearing a leather bracelet. Fast forward several scenes and this close up of this same bracelet appears on the wrist of this character "Carlo Liska"...and this leads me to believe that the man on the plane was this character "Carlo." But, back to Liv Tyler's character, "Lucy"...this character is a virgin, but that doesn't make her unsophisticated. She speaks Italian, smokes marijuana, and (really forward-thinking for 1996) fearlessly allows a man - a character of a writer (probably dying from AIDS) played by Jeremy Irons, to dress an open, bleeding wound on her knee. AIDS isn't mentioned, but it is implied. Making the subject of sex (circa 1996) that much more shocking. This is a dangerous activity, according to the zeitgeist of the 1990s. Life and death. I like to have this film just playing in the background, because the music is pleasant, and it's pretty much like being on vacation in Tuscany. It isn't a demanding film. It doesn't scream at you. It meanders from beautiful shot to beautiful shot, and having seen it 20 times already, I can leave the room and come back and it's still like a vacation in Tuscany. Naked, beautiful people on the surface, but there's more there if you choose to look.

    This is my favorite movie ever!!! Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast are excellent in this movie. The Tuscan scenery is gorgeous. It makes you wish you were there. I loved the story. The more you watch it the more you love it because you appreciate the surroundings, the music, the beautiful story. The only thing I had a hard time with was the beginning and how it related to the rest of the story. Also, I am usually not a fan of soundtracks, but the Stealing Beauty soundtrack is perfect!!!. I love the eclectic mix of music. The movie and the soundtrack deserve recognition. I can't believe how many people have not heard of this movie.

    Stealing Beauty is a character piece, not so much ever really driven by plot, and which makes it a particularly European-flavored entry in the Bernardo Bertolucci cannon of films he's made. This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time. It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at. If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of "will she or won't she" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling. Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work. Lacking really hardcore dramatic tension, it's mostly predicated on a 19-year old girl's quasi-coming-of-age. Which is interesting, up to a point.

    Lucy (played by Liv Tyler) is a 19 American girl which travels to Italy after her mother die. She's coming back to a farmhouse where her mother lived once. It's not the first time she's going there, she had been there four years earlier, so she knows almost everyone in the house. She's young, she's beautiful, she's very attractive, but she's also very innocent and virgin. Every man in the house, from the older to younger, feel her presence and enjoy it, on one or another way, because she's everything but invisible. Her presence is really noticed, but she's not provocative at all. In fact she's very calm and shy. The entire plot is about her, her feelings, people which surround her, and the way she's growing as a woman. It's all that together what makes this movie so beautiful and intimate, because it's a portrait of the fears and hopes, disillusions and happiness, joy and anger of a teenage girl which is having some "feelings" for the very first time. I enjoyed the story but also the settings used, because it's all so peaceful and calm, it's all so quiet in that lost place somewhere in Italy The cinematography is beautiful and has this "special touch" European cinema use to have, with those little details which turn the movie so truthful and realistic. I like it a lot! About the acting I must say I enjoyed especially two characters and the respective actors who played them. They were the character "Lucy", played by Liv Taylor and "Alex", played by Jeremy Irons. It's especially those two characters which make this story so beautiful to me. To sum up, it's a simple but wonderful movie and another excellent work by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    I saw this movie back in 1998 and I remembered I like it, but watched it again today. It's actually a very good movie and has gorgeous scenery and makes you want to go to Tuscany. There is a lot of nudity of both sexes. Gross. I'm not a prude, I just don't like seeing certain body parts on the big screen. Double gross. Liv Tyler is really beautiful, but I think it takes something away from a movie when you see people's giblets and gravy. I wish that all movies just cut away from that stuff-we know what they are going to do!Anyway, the best scenes are between Liv Tyler and Jeremy Irons. There are a couple of scenes that are very weird-must be very Italian. The best part of the entire movie, however, is the house, its gorgeous. Except the ugly statues everywhere.

    I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie "Stealing Beauty" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called "apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama." I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them. I re-watched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness. This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany. Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, "Enchanting April" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic. Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it. Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. "Stealing Beauty" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.

It meanders from beautiful shot to beautiful shot, and having seen it 20 times already, I can leave the room and come back and it's still like a vacation in Tuscany. Naked, beautiful people on the surface, but there's more there if you choose to look.

    This is my favorite movie ever!!! Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast are excellent in this movie. The Tuscan scenery is gorgeous. It makes you wish you were there. I loved the story. The more you watch it the more you love it because you appreciate the surroundings, the music, the beautiful story. The only thing I had a hard time with was the beginning and how it related to the rest of the story. Also, I am usually not a fan of soundtracks, but the Stealing Beauty soundtrack is perfect!!!. I love the eclectic mix of music. The movie and the soundtrack deserve recognition. I can't believe how many people have not heard of this movie.

    Stealing Beauty is a character piece, not so much ever really driven by plot, and which makes it a particularly European-flavored entry in the Bernardo Bertolucci cannon of films he's made. This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time. It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at. If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of "will she or won't she" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling. Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work. Lacking really hardcore dramatic tension, it's mostly predicated on a 19-year old girl's quasi-coming-of-age. Which is interesting, up to a point.

    Lucy (played by Liv Tyler) is a 19 American girl which travels to Italy after her mother die. She's coming back to a farmhouse where her mother lived once. It's not the first time she's going there, she had been there four years earlier, so she knows almost everyone in the house. She's young, she's beautiful, she's very attractive, but she's also very innocent and virgin. Every man in the house, from the older to younger, feel her presence and enjoy it, on one or another way, because she's everything but invisible. Her presence is really noticed, but she's not provocative at all. In fact she's very calm and shy. The entire plot is about her, her feelings, people which surround her, and the way she's growing as a woman. It's all that together what makes this movie so beautiful and intimate, because it's a portrait of the fears and hopes, disillusions and happiness, joy and anger of a teenage girl which is having some "feelings" for the very first time. I enjoyed the story but also the settings used, because it's all so peaceful and calm, it's all so quiet in that lost place somewhere in Italy The cinematography is beautiful and has this "special touch" European cinema use to have, with those little details which turn the movie so truthful and realistic. I like it a lot! About the acting I must say I enjoyed especially two characters and the respective actors who played them. They were the character "Lucy", played by Liv Taylor and "Alex", played by Jeremy Irons. It's especially those two characters which make this story so beautiful to me. To sum up, it's a simple but wonderful movie and another excellent work by Bernardo Bertolucci.
