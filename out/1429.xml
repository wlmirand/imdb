    When I first heard about this movie, I was really intrigued by the "gimmick" that there were two parallel plots: One where Gwyneth Paltrow catches a train, and one where she misses it, with both stories told together in real time. I really wondered how they could pull that off. The good news is: The two parallel plots are very easy to sort out and keep clear. And some of the "sub-gimmicks" are interesting. For example, in the first plot line Paltrow slowly develops a close relationship with another character, while in the second parallel plot she barely pays attention to that same character. So kudos to the filmmakers for pulling this off. However, as a whole: It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, not tense enough to be a drama, and there wasn't enough spark between the characters to be an effective romance. None of the lines were particularly memorable, and as proof, I direct you to the "Quotes" section of the Sliding Doors IMDb site. Go ahead, read through them. Not that great, right? Perhaps in some parallel universe there is a version of this film that I really love. But the version I saw can best be described as a noble experiment.

    This film could have been told along two different plot lines. Instead, they cleverly told the story along both plot lines...a sort of "what if" approach. I always give films extra points when they do something different...and this is a different kind of film. As we move back and forth between the two possible plot lines, sometimes it gets just a little confusing...at least briefly...which plot line are we in now? But that never lasts long. This is also very much a film dependent on strong performances. And there are some. I've long thought that Gwyneth Paltrow is one of those actresses who will be around for a long time; this film only bolsters that opinion. I'm not very familiar with John Hannah, but I enjoyed him a lot in this film. John Lynch (who shares my last name) stutters around too much in this film, but I suspect that was the way he was directed to act; I did laugh when Paltrow accuses him of acting like Woody Allen. Jeanne Tripplehorn comes across as a total (fill in the blank) here; nasty roles can be juicy, but I tire of an actor when he or she often plays the villain. The rest of the cast here are truly just supporting actors...important to film, but none stand out. You'll focus on the 3 primary characters...and they each have a lot of screen time since they are part of 2 different story lines. This is one film where the two endings allow you to be satisfied one way or the other.

    This is one of my all-time favourite movies. It's a bit too soppy and cringe-worthy at times (particularly when Helen gets involved with James), but I can live with that. It's an excellent concept, though. Something everyone can relate to. Makes you think... Speaking of James... unlike most people, I did not find his character in the least endearing. If anything, he was annoying as hell most of the time. I don't suppose Gwyneth Paltrow is a very good actress in general, but I'd say she did an O.K. job for this particular role - kind of. She always appears emotionless and unnatural - in most of her roles - and this was no exception. This was the main downside for me, though... the lead character is characterless (one-dimensional, no depth, unlikeable). Then again... maybe it was meant that way. But the rest of the cast were excellent - especially Jerry and Lydia. Jeanne Tripplehorn is gorgeous and very talented! Jerry was very funny, I'll give him that. Supreme acting. He could be the next Woody Allen. But the whole Jerry-Helen-Lydia thing was less than convincing. I mean, Helen does not appear to be ugly/stupid/desperate, nor does she seem to be head-over-heals in love with Jerry to begin with, so why the hell a woman like her would sign up for this whole thing and keep busting her a*** to support him financially? And Lydia... a successful, beautiful businesswoman chasing (madly!) after that kind of loser, and going to such trouble to win him back? Not very realistic at all. But anyway... I think it's a very good movie. I have seen it countless times and never really get tired of it. It's actually quite deep and thought-provoking, but some might need to watch it several times before they "get" it. A must-see for those, who enjoy this genre.

    Unlike most romcoms Sliding Doors has a touch more intelligence, wit and depth. It uses as its pivotal moment how one woman's life splits at the missing or catching of a train and the different consequences of each event. We've all said "what would have happened if..." and this film opens with that premise. The film is average, although there are great performances. I love John Hannah and he's always convincing and steady whatever he plays. Gwyneth Paltrow playing the two parallel life Helens is good, not brilliant, and a little bit flat, but it was perhaps perfect for this role where she goes through quite a bit. John Lynch and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both rather wooden) and a great Zara Turner adding a few laughs as the feisty supportive best friend are the supporting cast. Whilst quite a dark film, there's a fair bit of comedy. Set in a rather sterile looking London (I've never seen the Tube look so perfect), it's an intriguing concept and is executed well, the split easily and not-improbably identified via Helen's change of hair length and colour, and so you follow the two Helen's to the conclusion implying that - like all love stories - true love (probably) triumphs no matter how bumpy the road. Like time travel films (this is a similar though a different phenomenon) there are possible loopholes that you can talk yourself around to ponder. Sliding Doors is interesting and different, and whilst it's not Shakespeare in Love (my fav Paltrow film) or anything high brow it's good entertainment and greatly thought provoking.

    Very well made with a nice witty script and a decent pace so it doesn't get bogged down too much. It does look slightly dated though, but that's mostly to do with things like fashion and technology. I must admit I did find the premise of this film quite interesting; how just a couple of seconds at a crucial moment can make drastic changes to a life did intrigue me. I did enjoy the way it was done but ultimately it is about feelings and relationships which is fine as far as it goes. It did leave me with a few questions by the end and I see that as a good thing; there were certain things open to interpretation and any film that does that is always going to be worth a look, in my view. I will admit I did enjoy it up to a point; I found the characters quite engaging, there is some great dialogue and I even recognised one or two of the tunes! Over all, worth a look but I feel its one of those I'll only watch once (although I've been wrong about that before). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 7.2/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe the horse was lost. For want of a horse the rider was lost. For want of a rider the message was lost. For want of a message the battle was lost. For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail. This is a famous rhyme that resonates deeply within so many of us as it spells out to what extent a single simple incident can affect the whole course of a person's life or even the course of history. This movie examines this very idea by putting Helen(Paltrow), the protagonist, in a situation where her entire life is influenced by whether or not she catches a train. In the original scenario, she misses the train. But there is an alternate scenario outlining what could've happened had she caught it. Many people, particularly those who are facing a rough patch in their lives, spend a lot of time brooding on the question "how would my life have turned out if I had done this or that differently?" But rarely do we ever wonder "is it destined to be so?" The Kingdom might've fallen for want of a horseshoe nail, but was its time passed? This is what, by alternating between the two different scenarios, the movie tries to say. In the end, the Helen who caught the train ended up more successful but also ended up dead while the Helen who missed the train survived and could put her life together in future. Thus, instead of brooding over what could've been and what's lost, it's better to count your blessings, if any and make "what is" better for yourself. It might not be easy but if it's meant to happen, it will. All in all, while the movie is not exactly Oscar material, it's got depth and should be seen despite any and all flaws My rating-8/10

    The central plot device notwithstanding, "Sliding Doors" is a formulaic romantic comedy, with Paltrow a seemingly reluctant constant in the middle of the formula. (Peter Howitt, writer and director, does deserve credit for not trying to explain how the two wormholes through the romantic cosmos diverge--rather just presenting the intertwined versions of Helen's life). Jeanne Tripplehorn and John Lynch are each a lot of fun to watch. Lynch maintains a wonderfully dazed and confused demeanor in the face of womankind on the warpath, and Tripplehorn trods said warpath with great brio. Their lines aren't original, but they get into the spirit. The climax of the movie (no spoilers here) seems way contrived, and it disturbs whatever flow has been developed: writer-running-out-of-ideas material. Douglas McFerran, as Gerry's de rigueur funny mate, does a workmanlike job in magnifying Gerry's angst.

    That is what I want to tell the writers and producers of this movie! What this movie is trying to say is: Guys are normally cheaters and juggling multiple women, while the woman is working her ass off to support him. Then there is the helpful BFF who is the only person that is trustworthy and dependable. And the guy also has that buddy who helps him in his indiscretions and lies. All she wants is a helpful, rich guy, a guy who takes care of his mother, funny and can make her laugh. And then there are those movies which show just the opposite, cheating girls who have bitchy poisonous girlfriends, etc, etc. Just clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d and clich&eacute;d................... Hope you have read the official story line. You might feel that there is some sort of fantasy/sci-fi/special thing going on here. That premise that they talk of is just too thin. And I am now more and more a believable of the rating here at IMDb - see a rating less than 7 - then whatever good review someone might have posted about - or how intriguing the plot seems to be - not to see that movie. I have just seen this movie and I am sad to say, I feel it wasted my time. The print (dvd) is also too outdated for this day and age (2012), and this movie seemed too blurry. So even if you decide to see, if its a DVD, then avoid it. I don't thing a blue ray is even available. So I can't recommend this movie even for its visuals or something of that sort. Recommended - sorry, no. I recently saw some very good movies like the Help, Kungfu Panda 2, Drive, Ides of March, etc. There are too many good movies out there for us to choose from. Maybe even re-watching an old exemplary classic like Its a Wonderful Life........ Cheers!

    Every so often, I jump out of my usual genres to look at films that I normally wouldn't bother with. Rom-coms have never been of much interest to me (usually because so many are insipid and shallow) and "Sliding doors" is no exception. The one clever device in this film is the use of a single event (see the title) to permit the film to show alternate plot lines (or, "stories," as they might aspire to be). Taken individually, the plot lines are vapid and uninteresting. (After all, who gives a flip about imaginary romances involving mostly basically unlikable and stupid people, especially when poorly acted?) Unfortunately, this movie does not make good use of the one clever device that might have saved it. It's not used to advance either story and the efforts to build tension with the parallel stories just falls flat. I spent the last 100 minutes just waiting for something interesting to happen. BTW, the editing in this film is just abysmal. I felt like I was getting whiplash from snapping back and forth between the characters during virtually every conversation. I'll be generous and assume that it was an attempt at visually representing some sort of dislocation. Three stars for the idea alone, minus one star for crummy execution.

    I must confess that romantic comedies are not my type of film, but I make an exception for Sliding Doors. I have watched this film many times now and it still brings tears to my eyes. I don't know why because I know the story inside out by now. The story is about Helen, a young PR girl, who is having no luck with her job or with her boyfriend. She shares a home with her wayward boyfriend Gerry, a man who is trying to write his first novel and having a secret affair. At the start of the film she gets sacked from her job and then the film gets very interesting because two story lines develop as she makes her way home. As she gets on the tube, the train's sliding doors close and one story begins, but then the sliding doors open and the alternate story begins. The two stories revolve around Helen and her boyfriend Gerry, and two other people James, and Lydia. One story shows one twist of fate as she misses the train, the other story shows another set of circumstances as she gets on the train. Both stories play out scene by scene in a delightful romantic comedy. It is the great performances by all the cast, a brilliant idea, and a witty script that make this film a classic in its genre in my opinion. As with the best comedy, there is also tragedy that befalls the players in this drama, and you end up realising how complicated life is and how fate plays a big part in our lives. As someone who hates rom coms, I have to say that Sliding Doors is still one of my favourite films, and I watch it whenever it comes on the TV. There is so much to watch in this film: the growing love between Helen and James, or the comical attempts by Gerry to hide his affair with Lydia, or there is the twists and turns as the rocky relationships reach a climax by the end of the film. British films don't get much better than this. A great movie.

Then there is the helpful BFF who is the only person that is trustworthy and dependable. And the guy also has that buddy who helps him in his indiscretions and lies. All she wants is a helpful, rich guy, a guy who takes care of his mother, funny and can make her laugh. And then there are those movies which show just the opposite, cheating girls who have bitchy poisonous girlfriends, etc, etc. Just clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d and clich&eacute;d................... Hope you have read the official story line. You might feel that there is some sort of fantasy/sci-fi/special thing going on here. That premise that they talk of is just too thin. And I am now more and more a believable of the rating here at IMDb - see a rating less than 7 - then whatever good review someone might have posted about - or how intriguing the plot seems to be - not to see that movie. I have just seen this movie and I am sad to say, I feel it wasted my time. The print (dvd) is also too outdated for this day and age (2012), and this movie seemed too blurry. So even if you decide to see, if its a DVD, then avoid it. I don't thing a blue ray is even available. So I can't recommend this movie even for its visuals or something of that sort. Recommended - sorry, no. I recently saw some very good movies like the Help, Kungfu Panda 2, Drive, Ides of March, etc. There are too many good movies out there for us to choose from. Maybe even re-watching an old exemplary classic like Its a Wonderful Life........ Cheers!

    Every so often, I jump out of my usual genres to look at films that I normally wouldn't bother with. Rom-coms have never been of much interest to me (usually because so many are insipid and shallow) and "Sliding doors" is no exception. The one clever device in this film is the use of a single event (see the title) to permit the film to show alternate plot lines (or, "stories," as they might aspire to be). Taken individually, the plot lines are vapid and uninteresting. (After all, who gives a flip about imaginary romances involving mostly basically unlikable and stupid people, especially when poorly acted?) Unfortunately, this movie does not make good use of the one clever device that might have saved it. It's not used to advance either story and the efforts to build tension with the parallel stories just falls flat. I spent the last 100 minutes just waiting for something interesting to happen. BTW, the editing in this film is just abysmal. I felt like I was getting whiplash from snapping back and forth between the characters during virtually every conversation. I'll be generous and assume that it was an attempt at visually representing some sort of dislocation. Three stars for the idea alone, minus one star for crummy execution.

    I must confess that romantic comedies are not my type of film, but I make an exception for Sliding Doors. I have watched this film many times now and it still brings tears to my eyes. I don't know why because I know the story inside out by now. The story is about Helen, a young PR girl, who is having no luck with her job or with her boyfriend. She shares a home with her wayward boyfriend Gerry, a man who is trying to write his first novel and having a secret affair. At the start of the film she gets sacked from her job and then the film gets very interesting because two story lines develop as she makes her way home. As she gets on the tube, the train's sliding doors close and one story begins, but then the sliding doors open and the alternate story begins. The two stories revolve around Helen and her boyfriend Gerry, and two other people James, and Lydia. One story shows one twist of fate as she misses the train, the other story shows another set of circumstances as she gets on the train. Both stories play out scene by scene in a delightful romantic comedy. It is the great performances by all the cast, a brilliant idea, and a witty script that make this film a classic in its genre in my opinion. As with the best comedy, there is also tragedy that befalls the players in this drama, and you end up realising how complicated life is and how fate plays a big part in our lives. As someone who hates rom coms, I have to say that Sliding Doors is still one of my favourite films, and I watch it whenever it comes on the TV. There is so much to watch in this film: the growing love between Helen and James, or the comical attempts by Gerry to hide his affair with Lydia, or there is the twists and turns as the rocky relationships reach a climax by the end of the film. British films don't get much better than this. A great movie.

    When I first heard about this movie, I was really intrigued by the "gimmick" that there were two parallel plots: One where Gwyneth Paltrow catches a train, and one where she misses it, with both stories told together in real time. I really wondered how they could pull that off. The good news is: The two parallel plots are very easy to sort out and keep clear. And some of the "sub-gimmicks" are interesting. For example, in the first plot line Paltrow slowly develops a close relationship with another character, while in the second parallel plot she barely pays attention to that same character. So kudos to the filmmakers for pulling this off. However, as a whole: It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, not tense enough to be a drama, and there wasn't enough spark between the characters to be an effective romance. None of the lines were particularly memorable, and as proof, I direct you to the "Quotes" section of the Sliding Doors IMDb site. Go ahead, read through them. Not that great, right? Perhaps in some parallel universe there is a version of this film that I really love. But the version I saw can best be described as a noble experiment.

    This film could have been told along two different plot lines. Instead, they cleverly told the story along both plot lines...a sort of "what if" approach. I always give films extra points when they do something different...and this is a different kind of film. As we move back and forth between the two possible plot lines, sometimes it gets just a little confusing...at least briefly...which plot line are we in now? But that never lasts long. This is also very much a film dependent on strong performances. And there are some. I've long thought that Gwyneth Paltrow is one of those actresses who will be around for a long time; this film only bolsters that opinion. I'm not very familiar with John Hannah, but I enjoyed him a lot in this film. John Lynch (who shares my last name) stutters around too much in this film, but I suspect that was the way he was directed to act; I did laugh when Paltrow accuses him of acting like Woody Allen. Jeanne Tripplehorn comes across as a total (fill in the blank) here; nasty roles can be juicy, but I tire of an actor when he or she often plays the villain. The rest of the cast here are truly just supporting actors...important to film, but none stand out. You'll focus on the 3 primary characters...and they each have a lot of screen time since they are part of 2 different story lines. This is one film where the two endings allow you to be satisfied one way or the other.

    This is one of my all-time favourite movies. It's a bit too soppy and cringe-worthy at times (particularly when Helen gets involved with James), but I can live with that. It's an excellent concept, though. Something everyone can relate to. Makes you think... Speaking of James... unlike most people, I did not find his character in the least endearing. If anything, he was annoying as hell most of the time. I don't suppose Gwyneth Paltrow is a very good actress in general, but I'd say she did an O.K. job for this particular role - kind of. She always appears emotionless and unnatural - in most of her roles - and this was no exception. This was the main downside for me, though... the lead character is characterless (one-dimensional, no depth, unlikeable). Then again... maybe it was meant that way. But the rest of the cast were excellent - especially Jerry and Lydia. Jeanne Tripplehorn is gorgeous and very talented! Jerry was very funny, I'll give him that. Supreme acting. He could be the next Woody Allen. But the whole Jerry-Helen-Lydia thing was less than convincing. I mean, Helen does not appear to be ugly/stupid/desperate, nor does she seem to be head-over-heals in love with Jerry to begin with, so why the hell a woman like her would sign up for this whole thing and keep busting her a*** to support him financially? And Lydia... a successful, beautiful businesswoman chasing (madly!) after that kind of loser, and going to such trouble to win him back? Not very realistic at all. But anyway... I think it's a very good movie. I have seen it countless times and never really get tired of it. It's actually quite deep and thought-provoking, but some might need to watch it several times before they "get" it. A must-see for those, who enjoy this genre.

    Unlike most romcoms Sliding Doors has a touch more intelligence, wit and depth. It uses as its pivotal moment how one woman's life splits at the missing or catching of a train and the different consequences of each event. We've all said "what would have happened if..." and this film opens with that premise. The film is average, although there are great performances. I love John Hannah and he's always convincing and steady whatever he plays. Gwyneth Paltrow playing the two parallel life Helens is good, not brilliant, and a little bit flat, but it was perhaps perfect for this role where she goes through quite a bit. John Lynch and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both rather wooden) and a great Zara Turner adding a few laughs as the feisty supportive best friend are the supporting cast. Whilst quite a dark film, there's a fair bit of comedy. Set in a rather sterile looking London (I've never seen the Tube look so perfect), it's an intriguing concept and is executed well, the split easily and not-improbably identified via Helen's change of hair length and colour, and so you follow the two Helen's to the conclusion implying that - like all love stories - true love (probably) triumphs no matter how bumpy the road. Like time travel films (this is a similar though a different phenomenon) there are possible loopholes that you can talk yourself around to ponder. Sliding Doors is interesting and different, and whilst it's not Shakespeare in Love (my fav Paltrow film) or anything high brow it's good entertainment and greatly thought provoking.

    Very well made with a nice witty script and a decent pace so it doesn't get bogged down too much. It does look slightly dated though, but that's mostly to do with things like fashion and technology. I must admit I did find the premise of this film quite interesting; how just a couple of seconds at a crucial moment can make drastic changes to a life did intrigue me. I did enjoy the way it was done but ultimately it is about feelings and relationships which is fine as far as it goes. It did leave me with a few questions by the end and I see that as a good thing; there were certain things open to interpretation and any film that does that is always going to be worth a look, in my view. I will admit I did enjoy it up to a point; I found the characters quite engaging, there is some great dialogue and I even recognised one or two of the tunes! Over all, worth a look but I feel its one of those I'll only watch once (although I've been wrong about that before). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 7.2/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe the horse was lost. For want of a horse the rider was lost. For want of a rider the message was lost. For want of a message the battle was lost. For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail. This is a famous rhyme that resonates deeply within so many of us as it spells out to what extent a single simple incident can affect the whole course of a person's life or even the course of history. This movie examines this very idea by putting Helen(Paltrow), the protagonist, in a situation where her entire life is influenced by whether or not she catches a train. In the original scenario, she misses the train. But there is an alternate scenario outlining what could've happened had she caught it. Many people, particularly those who are facing a rough patch in their lives, spend a lot of time brooding on the question "how would my life have turned out if I had done this or that differently?" But rarely do we ever wonder "is it destined to be so?" The Kingdom might've fallen for want of a horseshoe nail, but was its time passed? This is what, by alternating between the two different scenarios, the movie tries to say. In the end, the Helen who caught the train ended up more successful but also ended up dead while the Helen who missed the train survived and could put her life together in future. Thus, instead of brooding over what could've been and what's lost, it's better to count your blessings, if any and make "what is" better for yourself. It might not be easy but if it's meant to happen, it will. All in all, while the movie is not exactly Oscar material, it's got depth and should be seen despite any and all flaws My rating-8/10

    The central plot device notwithstanding, "Sliding Doors" is a formulaic romantic comedy, with Paltrow a seemingly reluctant constant in the middle of the formula. (Peter Howitt, writer and director, does deserve credit for not trying to explain how the two wormholes through the romantic cosmos diverge--rather just presenting the intertwined versions of Helen's life). Jeanne Tripplehorn and John Lynch are each a lot of fun to watch. Lynch maintains a wonderfully dazed and confused demeanor in the face of womankind on the warpath, and Tripplehorn trods said warpath with great brio. Their lines aren't original, but they get into the spirit. The climax of the movie (no spoilers here) seems way contrived, and it disturbs whatever flow has been developed: writer-running-out-of-ideas material. Douglas McFerran, as Gerry's de rigueur funny mate, does a workmanlike job in magnifying Gerry's angst.

All she wants is a helpful, rich guy, a guy who takes care of his mother, funny and can make her laugh.

    For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe the horse was lost. For want of a horse the rider was lost. For want of a rider the message was lost. For want of a message the battle was lost. For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail. This is a famous rhyme that resonates deeply within so many of us as it spells out to what extent a single simple incident can affect the whole course of a person's life or even the course of history. This movie examines this very idea by putting Helen(Paltrow), the protagonist, in a situation where her entire life is influenced by whether or not she catches a train. In the original scenario, she misses the train. But there is an alternate scenario outlining what could've happened had she caught it. Many people, particularly those who are facing a rough patch in their lives, spend a lot of time brooding on the question "how would my life have turned out if I had done this or that differently?" But rarely do we ever wonder "is it destined to be so?" The Kingdom might've fallen for want of a horseshoe nail, but was its time passed? This is what, by alternating between the two different scenarios, the movie tries to say. In the end, the Helen who caught the train ended up more successful but also ended up dead while the Helen who missed the train survived and could put her life together in future. Thus, instead of brooding over what could've been and what's lost, it's better to count your blessings, if any and make "what is" better for yourself. It might not be easy but if it's meant to happen, it will. All in all, while the movie is not exactly Oscar material, it's got depth and should be seen despite any and all flaws My rating-8/10

    The central plot device notwithstanding, "Sliding Doors" is a formulaic romantic comedy, with Paltrow a seemingly reluctant constant in the middle of the formula. (Peter Howitt, writer and director, does deserve credit for not trying to explain how the two wormholes through the romantic cosmos diverge--rather just presenting the intertwined versions of Helen's life). Jeanne Tripplehorn and John Lynch are each a lot of fun to watch. Lynch maintains a wonderfully dazed and confused demeanor in the face of womankind on the warpath, and Tripplehorn trods said warpath with great brio. Their lines aren't original, but they get into the spirit. The climax of the movie (no spoilers here) seems way contrived, and it disturbs whatever flow has been developed: writer-running-out-of-ideas material. Douglas McFerran, as Gerry's de rigueur funny mate, does a workmanlike job in magnifying Gerry's angst.

    That is what I want to tell the writers and producers of this movie! What this movie is trying to say is: Guys are normally cheaters and juggling multiple women, while the woman is working her ass off to support him. Then there is the helpful BFF who is the only person that is trustworthy and dependable. And the guy also has that buddy who helps him in his indiscretions and lies. All she wants is a helpful, rich guy, a guy who takes care of his mother, funny and can make her laugh. And then there are those movies which show just the opposite, cheating girls who have bitchy poisonous girlfriends, etc, etc. Just clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d and clich&eacute;d................... Hope you have read the official story line. You might feel that there is some sort of fantasy/sci-fi/special thing going on here. That premise that they talk of is just too thin. And I am now more and more a believable of the rating here at IMDb - see a rating less than 7 - then whatever good review someone might have posted about - or how intriguing the plot seems to be - not to see that movie. I have just seen this movie and I am sad to say, I feel it wasted my time. The print (dvd) is also too outdated for this day and age (2012), and this movie seemed too blurry. So even if you decide to see, if its a DVD, then avoid it. I don't thing a blue ray is even available. So I can't recommend this movie even for its visuals or something of that sort. Recommended - sorry, no. I recently saw some very good movies like the Help, Kungfu Panda 2, Drive, Ides of March, etc. There are too many good movies out there for us to choose from. Maybe even re-watching an old exemplary classic like Its a Wonderful Life........ Cheers!

    Every so often, I jump out of my usual genres to look at films that I normally wouldn't bother with. Rom-coms have never been of much interest to me (usually because so many are insipid and shallow) and "Sliding doors" is no exception. The one clever device in this film is the use of a single event (see the title) to permit the film to show alternate plot lines (or, "stories," as they might aspire to be). Taken individually, the plot lines are vapid and uninteresting. (After all, who gives a flip about imaginary romances involving mostly basically unlikable and stupid people, especially when poorly acted?) Unfortunately, this movie does not make good use of the one clever device that might have saved it. It's not used to advance either story and the efforts to build tension with the parallel stories just falls flat. I spent the last 100 minutes just waiting for something interesting to happen. BTW, the editing in this film is just abysmal. I felt like I was getting whiplash from snapping back and forth between the characters during virtually every conversation. I'll be generous and assume that it was an attempt at visually representing some sort of dislocation. Three stars for the idea alone, minus one star for crummy execution.

    I must confess that romantic comedies are not my type of film, but I make an exception for Sliding Doors. I have watched this film many times now and it still brings tears to my eyes. I don't know why because I know the story inside out by now. The story is about Helen, a young PR girl, who is having no luck with her job or with her boyfriend. She shares a home with her wayward boyfriend Gerry, a man who is trying to write his first novel and having a secret affair. At the start of the film she gets sacked from her job and then the film gets very interesting because two story lines develop as she makes her way home. As she gets on the tube, the train's sliding doors close and one story begins, but then the sliding doors open and the alternate story begins. The two stories revolve around Helen and her boyfriend Gerry, and two other people James, and Lydia. One story shows one twist of fate as she misses the train, the other story shows another set of circumstances as she gets on the train. Both stories play out scene by scene in a delightful romantic comedy. It is the great performances by all the cast, a brilliant idea, and a witty script that make this film a classic in its genre in my opinion. As with the best comedy, there is also tragedy that befalls the players in this drama, and you end up realising how complicated life is and how fate plays a big part in our lives. As someone who hates rom coms, I have to say that Sliding Doors is still one of my favourite films, and I watch it whenever it comes on the TV. There is so much to watch in this film: the growing love between Helen and James, or the comical attempts by Gerry to hide his affair with Lydia, or there is the twists and turns as the rocky relationships reach a climax by the end of the film. British films don't get much better than this. A great movie.

    When I first heard about this movie, I was really intrigued by the "gimmick" that there were two parallel plots: One where Gwyneth Paltrow catches a train, and one where she misses it, with both stories told together in real time. I really wondered how they could pull that off. The good news is: The two parallel plots are very easy to sort out and keep clear. And some of the "sub-gimmicks" are interesting. For example, in the first plot line Paltrow slowly develops a close relationship with another character, while in the second parallel plot she barely pays attention to that same character. So kudos to the filmmakers for pulling this off. However, as a whole: It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, not tense enough to be a drama, and there wasn't enough spark between the characters to be an effective romance. None of the lines were particularly memorable, and as proof, I direct you to the "Quotes" section of the Sliding Doors IMDb site. Go ahead, read through them. Not that great, right? Perhaps in some parallel universe there is a version of this film that I really love. But the version I saw can best be described as a noble experiment.

    This film could have been told along two different plot lines. Instead, they cleverly told the story along both plot lines...a sort of "what if" approach. I always give films extra points when they do something different...and this is a different kind of film. As we move back and forth between the two possible plot lines, sometimes it gets just a little confusing...at least briefly...which plot line are we in now? But that never lasts long. This is also very much a film dependent on strong performances. And there are some. I've long thought that Gwyneth Paltrow is one of those actresses who will be around for a long time; this film only bolsters that opinion. I'm not very familiar with John Hannah, but I enjoyed him a lot in this film. John Lynch (who shares my last name) stutters around too much in this film, but I suspect that was the way he was directed to act; I did laugh when Paltrow accuses him of acting like Woody Allen. Jeanne Tripplehorn comes across as a total (fill in the blank) here; nasty roles can be juicy, but I tire of an actor when he or she often plays the villain. The rest of the cast here are truly just supporting actors...important to film, but none stand out. You'll focus on the 3 primary characters...and they each have a lot of screen time since they are part of 2 different story lines. This is one film where the two endings allow you to be satisfied one way or the other.

    This is one of my all-time favourite movies. It's a bit too soppy and cringe-worthy at times (particularly when Helen gets involved with James), but I can live with that. It's an excellent concept, though. Something everyone can relate to. Makes you think... Speaking of James... unlike most people, I did not find his character in the least endearing. If anything, he was annoying as hell most of the time. I don't suppose Gwyneth Paltrow is a very good actress in general, but I'd say she did an O.K. job for this particular role - kind of. She always appears emotionless and unnatural - in most of her roles - and this was no exception. This was the main downside for me, though... the lead character is characterless (one-dimensional, no depth, unlikeable). Then again... maybe it was meant that way. But the rest of the cast were excellent - especially Jerry and Lydia. Jeanne Tripplehorn is gorgeous and very talented! Jerry was very funny, I'll give him that. Supreme acting. He could be the next Woody Allen. But the whole Jerry-Helen-Lydia thing was less than convincing. I mean, Helen does not appear to be ugly/stupid/desperate, nor does she seem to be head-over-heals in love with Jerry to begin with, so why the hell a woman like her would sign up for this whole thing and keep busting her a*** to support him financially? And Lydia... a successful, beautiful businesswoman chasing (madly!) after that kind of loser, and going to such trouble to win him back? Not very realistic at all. But anyway... I think it's a very good movie. I have seen it countless times and never really get tired of it. It's actually quite deep and thought-provoking, but some might need to watch it several times before they "get" it. A must-see for those, who enjoy this genre.

    Unlike most romcoms Sliding Doors has a touch more intelligence, wit and depth. It uses as its pivotal moment how one woman's life splits at the missing or catching of a train and the different consequences of each event. We've all said "what would have happened if..." and this film opens with that premise. The film is average, although there are great performances. I love John Hannah and he's always convincing and steady whatever he plays. Gwyneth Paltrow playing the two parallel life Helens is good, not brilliant, and a little bit flat, but it was perhaps perfect for this role where she goes through quite a bit. John Lynch and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both rather wooden) and a great Zara Turner adding a few laughs as the feisty supportive best friend are the supporting cast. Whilst quite a dark film, there's a fair bit of comedy. Set in a rather sterile looking London (I've never seen the Tube look so perfect), it's an intriguing concept and is executed well, the split easily and not-improbably identified via Helen's change of hair length and colour, and so you follow the two Helen's to the conclusion implying that - like all love stories - true love (probably) triumphs no matter how bumpy the road. Like time travel films (this is a similar though a different phenomenon) there are possible loopholes that you can talk yourself around to ponder. Sliding Doors is interesting and different, and whilst it's not Shakespeare in Love (my fav Paltrow film) or anything high brow it's good entertainment and greatly thought provoking.

    Very well made with a nice witty script and a decent pace so it doesn't get bogged down too much. It does look slightly dated though, but that's mostly to do with things like fashion and technology. I must admit I did find the premise of this film quite interesting; how just a couple of seconds at a crucial moment can make drastic changes to a life did intrigue me. I did enjoy the way it was done but ultimately it is about feelings and relationships which is fine as far as it goes. It did leave me with a few questions by the end and I see that as a good thing; there were certain things open to interpretation and any film that does that is always going to be worth a look, in my view. I will admit I did enjoy it up to a point; I found the characters quite engaging, there is some great dialogue and I even recognised one or two of the tunes! Over all, worth a look but I feel its one of those I'll only watch once (although I've been wrong about that before). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 7.2/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

It uses as its pivotal moment how one woman's life splits at the missing or catching of a train and the different consequences of each event. We've all said "what would have happened if..." and this film opens with that premise. The film is average, although there are great performances. I love John Hannah and he's always convincing and steady whatever he plays. Gwyneth Paltrow playing the two parallel life Helens is good, not brilliant, and a little bit flat, but it was perhaps perfect for this role where she goes through quite a bit. John Lynch and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both rather wooden) and a great Zara Turner adding a few laughs as the feisty supportive best friend are the supporting cast. Whilst quite a dark film, there's a fair bit of comedy. Set in a rather sterile looking London (I've never seen the Tube look so perfect), it's an intriguing concept and is executed well, the split easily and not-improbably identified via Helen's change of hair length and colour, and so you follow the two Helen's to the conclusion implying that - like all love stories - true love (probably) triumphs no matter how bumpy the road. Like time travel films (this is a similar though a different phenomenon) there are possible loopholes that you can talk yourself around to ponder. Sliding Doors is interesting and different, and whilst it's not Shakespeare in Love (my fav Paltrow film) or anything high brow it's good entertainment and greatly thought provoking.

    Very well made with a nice witty script and a decent pace so it doesn't get bogged down too much. It does look slightly dated though, but that's mostly to do with things like fashion and technology. I must admit I did find the premise of this film quite interesting; how just a couple of seconds at a crucial moment can make drastic changes to a life did intrigue me. I did enjoy the way it was done but ultimately it is about feelings and relationships which is fine as far as it goes. It did leave me with a few questions by the end and I see that as a good thing; there were certain things open to interpretation and any film that does that is always going to be worth a look, in my view. I will admit I did enjoy it up to a point; I found the characters quite engaging, there is some great dialogue and I even recognised one or two of the tunes! Over all, worth a look but I feel its one of those I'll only watch once (although I've been wrong about that before). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 7.2/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe the horse was lost. For want of a horse the rider was lost. For want of a rider the message was lost. For want of a message the battle was lost. For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail. This is a famous rhyme that resonates deeply within so many of us as it spells out to what extent a single simple incident can affect the whole course of a person's life or even the course of history. This movie examines this very idea by putting Helen(Paltrow), the protagonist, in a situation where her entire life is influenced by whether or not she catches a train. In the original scenario, she misses the train. But there is an alternate scenario outlining what could've happened had she caught it. Many people, particularly those who are facing a rough patch in their lives, spend a lot of time brooding on the question "how would my life have turned out if I had done this or that differently?" But rarely do we ever wonder "is it destined to be so?" The Kingdom might've fallen for want of a horseshoe nail, but was its time passed? This is what, by alternating between the two different scenarios, the movie tries to say. In the end, the Helen who caught the train ended up more successful but also ended up dead while the Helen who missed the train survived and could put her life together in future. Thus, instead of brooding over what could've been and what's lost, it's better to count your blessings, if any and make "what is" better for yourself. It might not be easy but if it's meant to happen, it will. All in all, while the movie is not exactly Oscar material, it's got depth and should be seen despite any and all flaws My rating-8/10

    The central plot device notwithstanding, "Sliding Doors" is a formulaic romantic comedy, with Paltrow a seemingly reluctant constant in the middle of the formula. (Peter Howitt, writer and director, does deserve credit for not trying to explain how the two wormholes through the romantic cosmos diverge--rather just presenting the intertwined versions of Helen's life). Jeanne Tripplehorn and John Lynch are each a lot of fun to watch. Lynch maintains a wonderfully dazed and confused demeanor in the face of womankind on the warpath, and Tripplehorn trods said warpath with great brio. Their lines aren't original, but they get into the spirit. The climax of the movie (no spoilers here) seems way contrived, and it disturbs whatever flow has been developed: writer-running-out-of-ideas material. Douglas McFerran, as Gerry's de rigueur funny mate, does a workmanlike job in magnifying Gerry's angst.

    That is what I want to tell the writers and producers of this movie! What this movie is trying to say is: Guys are normally cheaters and juggling multiple women, while the woman is working her ass off to support him. Then there is the helpful BFF who is the only person that is trustworthy and dependable. And the guy also has that buddy who helps him in his indiscretions and lies. All she wants is a helpful, rich guy, a guy who takes care of his mother, funny and can make her laugh. And then there are those movies which show just the opposite, cheating girls who have bitchy poisonous girlfriends, etc, etc. Just clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d and clich&eacute;d................... Hope you have read the official story line. You might feel that there is some sort of fantasy/sci-fi/special thing going on here. That premise that they talk of is just too thin. And I am now more and more a believable of the rating here at IMDb - see a rating less than 7 - then whatever good review someone might have posted about - or how intriguing the plot seems to be - not to see that movie. I have just seen this movie and I am sad to say, I feel it wasted my time. The print (dvd) is also too outdated for this day and age (2012), and this movie seemed too blurry. So even if you decide to see, if its a DVD, then avoid it. I don't thing a blue ray is even available. So I can't recommend this movie even for its visuals or something of that sort. Recommended - sorry, no. I recently saw some very good movies like the Help, Kungfu Panda 2, Drive, Ides of March, etc. There are too many good movies out there for us to choose from. Maybe even re-watching an old exemplary classic like Its a Wonderful Life........ Cheers!

    Every so often, I jump out of my usual genres to look at films that I normally wouldn't bother with. Rom-coms have never been of much interest to me (usually because so many are insipid and shallow) and "Sliding doors" is no exception. The one clever device in this film is the use of a single event (see the title) to permit the film to show alternate plot lines (or, "stories," as they might aspire to be). Taken individually, the plot lines are vapid and uninteresting. (After all, who gives a flip about imaginary romances involving mostly basically unlikable and stupid people, especially when poorly acted?) Unfortunately, this movie does not make good use of the one clever device that might have saved it. It's not used to advance either story and the efforts to build tension with the parallel stories just falls flat. I spent the last 100 minutes just waiting for something interesting to happen. BTW, the editing in this film is just abysmal. I felt like I was getting whiplash from snapping back and forth between the characters during virtually every conversation. I'll be generous and assume that it was an attempt at visually representing some sort of dislocation. Three stars for the idea alone, minus one star for crummy execution.

    I must confess that romantic comedies are not my type of film, but I make an exception for Sliding Doors. I have watched this film many times now and it still brings tears to my eyes. I don't know why because I know the story inside out by now. The story is about Helen, a young PR girl, who is having no luck with her job or with her boyfriend. She shares a home with her wayward boyfriend Gerry, a man who is trying to write his first novel and having a secret affair. At the start of the film she gets sacked from her job and then the film gets very interesting because two story lines develop as she makes her way home. As she gets on the tube, the train's sliding doors close and one story begins, but then the sliding doors open and the alternate story begins. The two stories revolve around Helen and her boyfriend Gerry, and two other people James, and Lydia. One story shows one twist of fate as she misses the train, the other story shows another set of circumstances as she gets on the train. Both stories play out scene by scene in a delightful romantic comedy. It is the great performances by all the cast, a brilliant idea, and a witty script that make this film a classic in its genre in my opinion. As with the best comedy, there is also tragedy that befalls the players in this drama, and you end up realising how complicated life is and how fate plays a big part in our lives. As someone who hates rom coms, I have to say that Sliding Doors is still one of my favourite films, and I watch it whenever it comes on the TV. There is so much to watch in this film: the growing love between Helen and James, or the comical attempts by Gerry to hide his affair with Lydia, or there is the twists and turns as the rocky relationships reach a climax by the end of the film. British films don't get much better than this. A great movie.

    When I first heard about this movie, I was really intrigued by the "gimmick" that there were two parallel plots: One where Gwyneth Paltrow catches a train, and one where she misses it, with both stories told together in real time. I really wondered how they could pull that off. The good news is: The two parallel plots are very easy to sort out and keep clear. And some of the "sub-gimmicks" are interesting. For example, in the first plot line Paltrow slowly develops a close relationship with another character, while in the second parallel plot she barely pays attention to that same character. So kudos to the filmmakers for pulling this off. However, as a whole: It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, not tense enough to be a drama, and there wasn't enough spark between the characters to be an effective romance. None of the lines were particularly memorable, and as proof, I direct you to the "Quotes" section of the Sliding Doors IMDb site. Go ahead, read through them. Not that great, right? Perhaps in some parallel universe there is a version of this film that I really love. But the version I saw can best be described as a noble experiment.

    This film could have been told along two different plot lines. Instead, they cleverly told the story along both plot lines...a sort of "what if" approach. I always give films extra points when they do something different...and this is a different kind of film. As we move back and forth between the two possible plot lines, sometimes it gets just a little confusing...at least briefly...which plot line are we in now? But that never lasts long. This is also very much a film dependent on strong performances. And there are some. I've long thought that Gwyneth Paltrow is one of those actresses who will be around for a long time; this film only bolsters that opinion. I'm not very familiar with John Hannah, but I enjoyed him a lot in this film. John Lynch (who shares my last name) stutters around too much in this film, but I suspect that was the way he was directed to act; I did laugh when Paltrow accuses him of acting like Woody Allen. Jeanne Tripplehorn comes across as a total (fill in the blank) here; nasty roles can be juicy, but I tire of an actor when he or she often plays the villain. The rest of the cast here are truly just supporting actors...important to film, but none stand out. You'll focus on the 3 primary characters...and they each have a lot of screen time since they are part of 2 different story lines. This is one film where the two endings allow you to be satisfied one way or the other.

    This is one of my all-time favourite movies. It's a bit too soppy and cringe-worthy at times (particularly when Helen gets involved with James), but I can live with that. It's an excellent concept, though. Something everyone can relate to. Makes you think... Speaking of James... unlike most people, I did not find his character in the least endearing. If anything, he was annoying as hell most of the time. I don't suppose Gwyneth Paltrow is a very good actress in general, but I'd say she did an O.K. job for this particular role - kind of. She always appears emotionless and unnatural - in most of her roles - and this was no exception. This was the main downside for me, though... the lead character is characterless (one-dimensional, no depth, unlikeable). Then again... maybe it was meant that way. But the rest of the cast were excellent - especially Jerry and Lydia. Jeanne Tripplehorn is gorgeous and very talented! Jerry was very funny, I'll give him that. Supreme acting. He could be the next Woody Allen. But the whole Jerry-Helen-Lydia thing was less than convincing. I mean, Helen does not appear to be ugly/stupid/desperate, nor does she seem to be head-over-heals in love with Jerry to begin with, so why the hell a woman like her would sign up for this whole thing and keep busting her a*** to support him financially? And Lydia... a successful, beautiful businesswoman chasing (madly!) after that kind of loser, and going to such trouble to win him back? Not very realistic at all. But anyway... I think it's a very good movie. I have seen it countless times and never really get tired of it. It's actually quite deep and thought-provoking, but some might need to watch it several times before they "get" it. A must-see for those, who enjoy this genre.

John Lynch (who shares my last name) stutters around too much in this film, but I suspect that was the way he was directed to act; I did laugh when Paltrow accuses him of acting like Woody Allen. Jeanne Tripplehorn comes across as a total (fill in the blank) here; nasty roles can be juicy, but I tire of an actor when he or she often plays the villain. The rest of the cast here are truly just supporting actors...important to film, but none stand out. You'll focus on the 3 primary characters...and they each have a lot of screen time since they are part of 2 different story lines. This is one film where the two endings allow you to be satisfied one way or the other.

    This is one of my all-time favourite movies. It's a bit too soppy and cringe-worthy at times (particularly when Helen gets involved with James), but I can live with that. It's an excellent concept, though. Something everyone can relate to. Makes you think... Speaking of James... unlike most people, I did not find his character in the least endearing. If anything, he was annoying as hell most of the time. I don't suppose Gwyneth Paltrow is a very good actress in general, but I'd say she did an O.K. job for this particular role - kind of. She always appears emotionless and unnatural - in most of her roles - and this was no exception. This was the main downside for me, though... the lead character is characterless (one-dimensional, no depth, unlikeable). Then again... maybe it was meant that way. But the rest of the cast were excellent - especially Jerry and Lydia. Jeanne Tripplehorn is gorgeous and very talented! Jerry was very funny, I'll give him that. Supreme acting. He could be the next Woody Allen. But the whole Jerry-Helen-Lydia thing was less than convincing. I mean, Helen does not appear to be ugly/stupid/desperate, nor does she seem to be head-over-heals in love with Jerry to begin with, so why the hell a woman like her would sign up for this whole thing and keep busting her a*** to support him financially? And Lydia... a successful, beautiful businesswoman chasing (madly!) after that kind of loser, and going to such trouble to win him back? Not very realistic at all. But anyway... I think it's a very good movie. I have seen it countless times and never really get tired of it. It's actually quite deep and thought-provoking, but some might need to watch it several times before they "get" it. A must-see for those, who enjoy this genre.

    Unlike most romcoms Sliding Doors has a touch more intelligence, wit and depth. It uses as its pivotal moment how one woman's life splits at the missing or catching of a train and the different consequences of each event. We've all said "what would have happened if..." and this film opens with that premise. The film is average, although there are great performances. I love John Hannah and he's always convincing and steady whatever he plays. Gwyneth Paltrow playing the two parallel life Helens is good, not brilliant, and a little bit flat, but it was perhaps perfect for this role where she goes through quite a bit. John Lynch and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both rather wooden) and a great Zara Turner adding a few laughs as the feisty supportive best friend are the supporting cast. Whilst quite a dark film, there's a fair bit of comedy. Set in a rather sterile looking London (I've never seen the Tube look so perfect), it's an intriguing concept and is executed well, the split easily and not-improbably identified via Helen's change of hair length and colour, and so you follow the two Helen's to the conclusion implying that - like all love stories - true love (probably) triumphs no matter how bumpy the road. Like time travel films (this is a similar though a different phenomenon) there are possible loopholes that you can talk yourself around to ponder. Sliding Doors is interesting and different, and whilst it's not Shakespeare in Love (my fav Paltrow film) or anything high brow it's good entertainment and greatly thought provoking.

    Very well made with a nice witty script and a decent pace so it doesn't get bogged down too much. It does look slightly dated though, but that's mostly to do with things like fashion and technology. I must admit I did find the premise of this film quite interesting; how just a couple of seconds at a crucial moment can make drastic changes to a life did intrigue me. I did enjoy the way it was done but ultimately it is about feelings and relationships which is fine as far as it goes. It did leave me with a few questions by the end and I see that as a good thing; there were certain things open to interpretation and any film that does that is always going to be worth a look, in my view. I will admit I did enjoy it up to a point; I found the characters quite engaging, there is some great dialogue and I even recognised one or two of the tunes! Over all, worth a look but I feel its one of those I'll only watch once (although I've been wrong about that before). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 7.2/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe the horse was lost. For want of a horse the rider was lost. For want of a rider the message was lost. For want of a message the battle was lost. For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail. This is a famous rhyme that resonates deeply within so many of us as it spells out to what extent a single simple incident can affect the whole course of a person's life or even the course of history. This movie examines this very idea by putting Helen(Paltrow), the protagonist, in a situation where her entire life is influenced by whether or not she catches a train. In the original scenario, she misses the train. But there is an alternate scenario outlining what could've happened had she caught it. Many people, particularly those who are facing a rough patch in their lives, spend a lot of time brooding on the question "how would my life have turned out if I had done this or that differently?" But rarely do we ever wonder "is it destined to be so?" The Kingdom might've fallen for want of a horseshoe nail, but was its time passed? This is what, by alternating between the two different scenarios, the movie tries to say. In the end, the Helen who caught the train ended up more successful but also ended up dead while the Helen who missed the train survived and could put her life together in future. Thus, instead of brooding over what could've been and what's lost, it's better to count your blessings, if any and make "what is" better for yourself. It might not be easy but if it's meant to happen, it will. All in all, while the movie is not exactly Oscar material, it's got depth and should be seen despite any and all flaws My rating-8/10

    The central plot device notwithstanding, "Sliding Doors" is a formulaic romantic comedy, with Paltrow a seemingly reluctant constant in the middle of the formula. (Peter Howitt, writer and director, does deserve credit for not trying to explain how the two wormholes through the romantic cosmos diverge--rather just presenting the intertwined versions of Helen's life). Jeanne Tripplehorn and John Lynch are each a lot of fun to watch. Lynch maintains a wonderfully dazed and confused demeanor in the face of womankind on the warpath, and Tripplehorn trods said warpath with great brio. Their lines aren't original, but they get into the spirit. The climax of the movie (no spoilers here) seems way contrived, and it disturbs whatever flow has been developed: writer-running-out-of-ideas material. Douglas McFerran, as Gerry's de rigueur funny mate, does a workmanlike job in magnifying Gerry's angst.

    That is what I want to tell the writers and producers of this movie! What this movie is trying to say is: Guys are normally cheaters and juggling multiple women, while the woman is working her ass off to support him. Then there is the helpful BFF who is the only person that is trustworthy and dependable. And the guy also has that buddy who helps him in his indiscretions and lies. All she wants is a helpful, rich guy, a guy who takes care of his mother, funny and can make her laugh. And then there are those movies which show just the opposite, cheating girls who have bitchy poisonous girlfriends, etc, etc. Just clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d and clich&eacute;d................... Hope you have read the official story line. You might feel that there is some sort of fantasy/sci-fi/special thing going on here. That premise that they talk of is just too thin. And I am now more and more a believable of the rating here at IMDb - see a rating less than 7 - then whatever good review someone might have posted about - or how intriguing the plot seems to be - not to see that movie. I have just seen this movie and I am sad to say, I feel it wasted my time. The print (dvd) is also too outdated for this day and age (2012), and this movie seemed too blurry. So even if you decide to see, if its a DVD, then avoid it. I don't thing a blue ray is even available. So I can't recommend this movie even for its visuals or something of that sort. Recommended - sorry, no. I recently saw some very good movies like the Help, Kungfu Panda 2, Drive, Ides of March, etc. There are too many good movies out there for us to choose from. Maybe even re-watching an old exemplary classic like Its a Wonderful Life........ Cheers!

    Every so often, I jump out of my usual genres to look at films that I normally wouldn't bother with. Rom-coms have never been of much interest to me (usually because so many are insipid and shallow) and "Sliding doors" is no exception. The one clever device in this film is the use of a single event (see the title) to permit the film to show alternate plot lines (or, "stories," as they might aspire to be). Taken individually, the plot lines are vapid and uninteresting. (After all, who gives a flip about imaginary romances involving mostly basically unlikable and stupid people, especially when poorly acted?) Unfortunately, this movie does not make good use of the one clever device that might have saved it. It's not used to advance either story and the efforts to build tension with the parallel stories just falls flat. I spent the last 100 minutes just waiting for something interesting to happen. BTW, the editing in this film is just abysmal. I felt like I was getting whiplash from snapping back and forth between the characters during virtually every conversation. I'll be generous and assume that it was an attempt at visually representing some sort of dislocation. Three stars for the idea alone, minus one star for crummy execution.

    I must confess that romantic comedies are not my type of film, but I make an exception for Sliding Doors. I have watched this film many times now and it still brings tears to my eyes. I don't know why because I know the story inside out by now. The story is about Helen, a young PR girl, who is having no luck with her job or with her boyfriend. She shares a home with her wayward boyfriend Gerry, a man who is trying to write his first novel and having a secret affair. At the start of the film she gets sacked from her job and then the film gets very interesting because two story lines develop as she makes her way home. As she gets on the tube, the train's sliding doors close and one story begins, but then the sliding doors open and the alternate story begins. The two stories revolve around Helen and her boyfriend Gerry, and two other people James, and Lydia. One story shows one twist of fate as she misses the train, the other story shows another set of circumstances as she gets on the train. Both stories play out scene by scene in a delightful romantic comedy. It is the great performances by all the cast, a brilliant idea, and a witty script that make this film a classic in its genre in my opinion. As with the best comedy, there is also tragedy that befalls the players in this drama, and you end up realising how complicated life is and how fate plays a big part in our lives. As someone who hates rom coms, I have to say that Sliding Doors is still one of my favourite films, and I watch it whenever it comes on the TV. There is so much to watch in this film: the growing love between Helen and James, or the comical attempts by Gerry to hide his affair with Lydia, or there is the twists and turns as the rocky relationships reach a climax by the end of the film. British films don't get much better than this. A great movie.

    When I first heard about this movie, I was really intrigued by the "gimmick" that there were two parallel plots: One where Gwyneth Paltrow catches a train, and one where she misses it, with both stories told together in real time. I really wondered how they could pull that off. The good news is: The two parallel plots are very easy to sort out and keep clear. And some of the "sub-gimmicks" are interesting. For example, in the first plot line Paltrow slowly develops a close relationship with another character, while in the second parallel plot she barely pays attention to that same character. So kudos to the filmmakers for pulling this off. However, as a whole: It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, not tense enough to be a drama, and there wasn't enough spark between the characters to be an effective romance. None of the lines were particularly memorable, and as proof, I direct you to the "Quotes" section of the Sliding Doors IMDb site. Go ahead, read through them. Not that great, right? Perhaps in some parallel universe there is a version of this film that I really love. But the version I saw can best be described as a noble experiment.

    This film could have been told along two different plot lines. Instead, they cleverly told the story along both plot lines...a sort of "what if" approach. I always give films extra points when they do something different...and this is a different kind of film. As we move back and forth between the two possible plot lines, sometimes it gets just a little confusing...at least briefly...which plot line are we in now? But that never lasts long. This is also very much a film dependent on strong performances. And there are some. I've long thought that Gwyneth Paltrow is one of those actresses who will be around for a long time; this film only bolsters that opinion. I'm not very familiar with John Hannah, but I enjoyed him a lot in this film. John Lynch (who shares my last name) stutters around too much in this film, but I suspect that was the way he was directed to act; I did laugh when Paltrow accuses him of acting like Woody Allen. Jeanne Tripplehorn comes across as a total (fill in the blank) here; nasty roles can be juicy, but I tire of an actor when he or she often plays the villain. The rest of the cast here are truly just supporting actors...important to film, but none stand out. You'll focus on the 3 primary characters...and they each have a lot of screen time since they are part of 2 different story lines. This is one film where the two endings allow you to be satisfied one way or the other.

Both stories play out scene by scene in a delightful romantic comedy. It is the great performances by all the cast, a brilliant idea, and a witty script that make this film a classic in its genre in my opinion. As with the best comedy, there is also tragedy that befalls the players in this drama, and you end up realising how complicated life is and how fate plays a big part in our lives. As someone who hates rom coms, I have to say that Sliding Doors is still one of my favourite films, and I watch it whenever it comes on the TV. There is so much to watch in this film: the growing love between Helen and James, or the comical attempts by Gerry to hide his affair with Lydia, or there is the twists and turns as the rocky relationships reach a climax by the end of the film. British films don't get much better than this. A great movie.

    When I first heard about this movie, I was really intrigued by the "gimmick" that there were two parallel plots: One where Gwyneth Paltrow catches a train, and one where she misses it, with both stories told together in real time. I really wondered how they could pull that off. The good news is: The two parallel plots are very easy to sort out and keep clear. And some of the "sub-gimmicks" are interesting. For example, in the first plot line Paltrow slowly develops a close relationship with another character, while in the second parallel plot she barely pays attention to that same character. So kudos to the filmmakers for pulling this off. However, as a whole: It wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, not tense enough to be a drama, and there wasn't enough spark between the characters to be an effective romance. None of the lines were particularly memorable, and as proof, I direct you to the "Quotes" section of the Sliding Doors IMDb site. Go ahead, read through them. Not that great, right? Perhaps in some parallel universe there is a version of this film that I really love. But the version I saw can best be described as a noble experiment.

    This film could have been told along two different plot lines. Instead, they cleverly told the story along both plot lines...a sort of "what if" approach. I always give films extra points when they do something different...and this is a different kind of film. As we move back and forth between the two possible plot lines, sometimes it gets just a little confusing...at least briefly...which plot line are we in now? But that never lasts long. This is also very much a film dependent on strong performances. And there are some. I've long thought that Gwyneth Paltrow is one of those actresses who will be around for a long time; this film only bolsters that opinion. I'm not very familiar with John Hannah, but I enjoyed him a lot in this film. John Lynch (who shares my last name) stutters around too much in this film, but I suspect that was the way he was directed to act; I did laugh when Paltrow accuses him of acting like Woody Allen. Jeanne Tripplehorn comes across as a total (fill in the blank) here; nasty roles can be juicy, but I tire of an actor when he or she often plays the villain. The rest of the cast here are truly just supporting actors...important to film, but none stand out. You'll focus on the 3 primary characters...and they each have a lot of screen time since they are part of 2 different story lines. This is one film where the two endings allow you to be satisfied one way or the other.

    This is one of my all-time favourite movies. It's a bit too soppy and cringe-worthy at times (particularly when Helen gets involved with James), but I can live with that. It's an excellent concept, though. Something everyone can relate to. Makes you think... Speaking of James... unlike most people, I did not find his character in the least endearing. If anything, he was annoying as hell most of the time. I don't suppose Gwyneth Paltrow is a very good actress in general, but I'd say she did an O.K. job for this particular role - kind of. She always appears emotionless and unnatural - in most of her roles - and this was no exception. This was the main downside for me, though... the lead character is characterless (one-dimensional, no depth, unlikeable). Then again... maybe it was meant that way. But the rest of the cast were excellent - especially Jerry and Lydia. Jeanne Tripplehorn is gorgeous and very talented! Jerry was very funny, I'll give him that. Supreme acting. He could be the next Woody Allen. But the whole Jerry-Helen-Lydia thing was less than convincing. I mean, Helen does not appear to be ugly/stupid/desperate, nor does she seem to be head-over-heals in love with Jerry to begin with, so why the hell a woman like her would sign up for this whole thing and keep busting her a*** to support him financially? And Lydia... a successful, beautiful businesswoman chasing (madly!) after that kind of loser, and going to such trouble to win him back? Not very realistic at all. But anyway... I think it's a very good movie. I have seen it countless times and never really get tired of it. It's actually quite deep and thought-provoking, but some might need to watch it several times before they "get" it. A must-see for those, who enjoy this genre.

    Unlike most romcoms Sliding Doors has a touch more intelligence, wit and depth. It uses as its pivotal moment how one woman's life splits at the missing or catching of a train and the different consequences of each event. We've all said "what would have happened if..." and this film opens with that premise. The film is average, although there are great performances. I love John Hannah and he's always convincing and steady whatever he plays. Gwyneth Paltrow playing the two parallel life Helens is good, not brilliant, and a little bit flat, but it was perhaps perfect for this role where she goes through quite a bit. John Lynch and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both rather wooden) and a great Zara Turner adding a few laughs as the feisty supportive best friend are the supporting cast. Whilst quite a dark film, there's a fair bit of comedy. Set in a rather sterile looking London (I've never seen the Tube look so perfect), it's an intriguing concept and is executed well, the split easily and not-improbably identified via Helen's change of hair length and colour, and so you follow the two Helen's to the conclusion implying that - like all love stories - true love (probably) triumphs no matter how bumpy the road. Like time travel films (this is a similar though a different phenomenon) there are possible loopholes that you can talk yourself around to ponder. Sliding Doors is interesting and different, and whilst it's not Shakespeare in Love (my fav Paltrow film) or anything high brow it's good entertainment and greatly thought provoking.

    Very well made with a nice witty script and a decent pace so it doesn't get bogged down too much. It does look slightly dated though, but that's mostly to do with things like fashion and technology. I must admit I did find the premise of this film quite interesting; how just a couple of seconds at a crucial moment can make drastic changes to a life did intrigue me. I did enjoy the way it was done but ultimately it is about feelings and relationships which is fine as far as it goes. It did leave me with a few questions by the end and I see that as a good thing; there were certain things open to interpretation and any film that does that is always going to be worth a look, in my view. I will admit I did enjoy it up to a point; I found the characters quite engaging, there is some great dialogue and I even recognised one or two of the tunes! Over all, worth a look but I feel its one of those I'll only watch once (although I've been wrong about that before). SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 7.2/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe the horse was lost. For want of a horse the rider was lost. For want of a rider the message was lost. For want of a message the battle was lost. For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail. This is a famous rhyme that resonates deeply within so many of us as it spells out to what extent a single simple incident can affect the whole course of a person's life or even the course of history. This movie examines this very idea by putting Helen(Paltrow), the protagonist, in a situation where her entire life is influenced by whether or not she catches a train. In the original scenario, she misses the train. But there is an alternate scenario outlining what could've happened had she caught it. Many people, particularly those who are facing a rough patch in their lives, spend a lot of time brooding on the question "how would my life have turned out if I had done this or that differently?" But rarely do we ever wonder "is it destined to be so?" The Kingdom might've fallen for want of a horseshoe nail, but was its time passed? This is what, by alternating between the two different scenarios, the movie tries to say. In the end, the Helen who caught the train ended up more successful but also ended up dead while the Helen who missed the train survived and could put her life together in future. Thus, instead of brooding over what could've been and what's lost, it's better to count your blessings, if any and make "what is" better for yourself. It might not be easy but if it's meant to happen, it will. All in all, while the movie is not exactly Oscar material, it's got depth and should be seen despite any and all flaws My rating-8/10

    The central plot device notwithstanding, "Sliding Doors" is a formulaic romantic comedy, with Paltrow a seemingly reluctant constant in the middle of the formula. (Peter Howitt, writer and director, does deserve credit for not trying to explain how the two wormholes through the romantic cosmos diverge--rather just presenting the intertwined versions of Helen's life). Jeanne Tripplehorn and John Lynch are each a lot of fun to watch. Lynch maintains a wonderfully dazed and confused demeanor in the face of womankind on the warpath, and Tripplehorn trods said warpath with great brio. Their lines aren't original, but they get into the spirit. The climax of the movie (no spoilers here) seems way contrived, and it disturbs whatever flow has been developed: writer-running-out-of-ideas material. Douglas McFerran, as Gerry's de rigueur funny mate, does a workmanlike job in magnifying Gerry's angst.

    That is what I want to tell the writers and producers of this movie! What this movie is trying to say is: Guys are normally cheaters and juggling multiple women, while the woman is working her ass off to support him. Then there is the helpful BFF who is the only person that is trustworthy and dependable. And the guy also has that buddy who helps him in his indiscretions and lies. All she wants is a helpful, rich guy, a guy who takes care of his mother, funny and can make her laugh. And then there are those movies which show just the opposite, cheating girls who have bitchy poisonous girlfriends, etc, etc. Just clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d, clich&eacute;d and clich&eacute;d................... Hope you have read the official story line. You might feel that there is some sort of fantasy/sci-fi/special thing going on here. That premise that they talk of is just too thin. And I am now more and more a believable of the rating here at IMDb - see a rating less than 7 - then whatever good review someone might have posted about - or how intriguing the plot seems to be - not to see that movie. I have just seen this movie and I am sad to say, I feel it wasted my time. The print (dvd) is also too outdated for this day and age (2012), and this movie seemed too blurry. So even if you decide to see, if its a DVD, then avoid it. I don't thing a blue ray is even available. So I can't recommend this movie even for its visuals or something of that sort. Recommended - sorry, no. I recently saw some very good movies like the Help, Kungfu Panda 2, Drive, Ides of March, etc. There are too many good movies out there for us to choose from. Maybe even re-watching an old exemplary classic like Its a Wonderful Life........ Cheers!

    Every so often, I jump out of my usual genres to look at films that I normally wouldn't bother with. Rom-coms have never been of much interest to me (usually because so many are insipid and shallow) and "Sliding doors" is no exception. The one clever device in this film is the use of a single event (see the title) to permit the film to show alternate plot lines (or, "stories," as they might aspire to be). Taken individually, the plot lines are vapid and uninteresting. (After all, who gives a flip about imaginary romances involving mostly basically unlikable and stupid people, especially when poorly acted?) Unfortunately, this movie does not make good use of the one clever device that might have saved it. It's not used to advance either story and the efforts to build tension with the parallel stories just falls flat. I spent the last 100 minutes just waiting for something interesting to happen. BTW, the editing in this film is just abysmal. I felt like I was getting whiplash from snapping back and forth between the characters during virtually every conversation. I'll be generous and assume that it was an attempt at visually representing some sort of dislocation. Three stars for the idea alone, minus one star for crummy execution.

    I must confess that romantic comedies are not my type of film, but I make an exception for Sliding Doors. I have watched this film many times now and it still brings tears to my eyes. I don't know why because I know the story inside out by now. The story is about Helen, a young PR girl, who is having no luck with her job or with her boyfriend. She shares a home with her wayward boyfriend Gerry, a man who is trying to write his first novel and having a secret affair. At the start of the film she gets sacked from her job and then the film gets very interesting because two story lines develop as she makes her way home. As she gets on the tube, the train's sliding doors close and one story begins, but then the sliding doors open and the alternate story begins. The two stories revolve around Helen and her boyfriend Gerry, and two other people James, and Lydia. One story shows one twist of fate as she misses the train, the other story shows another set of circumstances as she gets on the train. Both stories play out scene by scene in a delightful romantic comedy. It is the great performances by all the cast, a brilliant idea, and a witty script that make this film a classic in its genre in my opinion. As with the best comedy, there is also tragedy that befalls the players in this drama, and you end up realising how complicated life is and how fate plays a big part in our lives. As someone who hates rom coms, I have to say that Sliding Doors is still one of my favourite films, and I watch it whenever it comes on the TV. There is so much to watch in this film: the growing love between Helen and James, or the comical attempts by Gerry to hide his affair with Lydia, or there is the twists and turns as the rocky relationships reach a climax by the end of the film. British films don't get much better than this. A great movie.
