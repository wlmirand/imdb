 <sinopse>
  The story of the original US Mercury 7 astronauts and their macho, seat-of-the-pants approach to the space program.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Tom Wolfe's book on the history of the U.S. Space program reads like a novel, and the film has that same fictional quality. It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager to the Mercury 7 astronauts, showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select people to be in it. Thrilling, funny, charming and electrifying all at once.

    Philip Kaufman's soaring adaptation of Tom Wolfe's biographical account of the space program, starting with Chuck Yeager's(played by Sam Shepherd) breaking the sound barrier, to the Mercury 7, the first American astronauts(played by Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Lance Henriksen, and others) to go into outer space. Film details the process of selection and training involved in preparing the astronauts for flight, as well as focusing on how they handle the media and each other. They are portrayed as real men, not cardboard cutouts, which is refreshing. A very well directed, written, and acted film is truly inspiring in how it portrays the successes and failures of these brave men, and the women in their lives. Though over three hours, it doesn't drag much, and is a most satisfying true story.

    "Is that a man?" asks the pilot of a rescue plane headed towards the crash site of Chuck Yeager's attempt to reach the edge of space in a Lockheed NF-104A. An outline of a man appears on the horizon, blurred by heat and mirage, his face bloody and burned, walking at pace with his helmet in his hand. Yeager's good friend Jack Ridley sits in the passenger seat, having seen Yeager conquer several near-suicidal flight records, including the first to break the sound barrier. Ridley smiles. "You're damn right it is!". The Right Stuff, adapted from Tom Wolfe's best-selling account of the test-pilots in the Mercury Space Program, shows what it takes to be a man; to have the 'right stuff' inhabited by these fearless men, who were the only ones crazy enough to risk everything, on live TV, to beat the Russians in the space race. Besides the many fascinating and frequently hilarious vignettes involving the test pilots - played by a stellar cast of Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Charles Frank, Lance Henriksen, Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin - the movie's real ace-in-the-hole is the juxtaposition of this story with that of Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a man thought of by his peers to be the finest pilot in the world. Played stoically by an Oscar- nominated Sam Shepard, he is brooding, dusty, a true man's man, but without the college degree needed to join the space program. He is the polar opposite of the 'hot dog's' of the Mercury Program, and when he is not off chasing his wild wife Glennis (Barbara Hershey), he is making sure he is still the fastest man in the world. Even at over 3 hours, the movie is packed with great and memorable scenes. Director Philip Kaufman managed to retain Wolfe's skill for absurd humour, so we get to see the President crawling on the floor to plug in a projector, two astronauts' slow walk to the bathroom following an enema, and a hilarious moment involving humming and sperm samples. It has an observational aesthetic that America conquered in the 1970's, made even better by some amazing aviation and space travel scenes, easily more exciting than the CGI-laden movies we get nowadays. It's often called the second-best movie of the 1980's behind Raging Bull (1980), and, although I don't necessarily agree with that statement (Blue Velvet (1986), anyone?), it's one of the finest movies to come out of it's era, feeling almost classical despite being modern. Like Shepard's Chuck Yeager, The Right Stuff seems old before its time, encompassing wisdom and poignancy with ease. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Writer/director Phil Kaufman makes the mistake of simply reading Tom Wolfe's excellent novel of the same name, and then filming this movie accordingly. This was a recipe for disaster. Wolfe talks a lot about astronaut Gordon Cooper, but in no way was Cooper the 'center' of the early western space program and Wolfe did not imply such a thing. All original seven astronauts were equally responsible for the program's success, yet Kaufman interprets Cooper's involvement as being the most important.... wrong. Cooper is mentioned near the end of the novel, so Kaufman ended his film with a red, white, and blue fanfare to present Cooper's flight as the pinnacle of everything cosmic. Apparently Kaufman did not research his subject. Good points: attention to period detail and the cameo appearance of General Chuck Yeager as a bartender.

    Director Phil Kaufmann and Producer Alan Ladd brought to the screen a movie masterpiece in The Right Stuff. Starring Sam Shephard and a roster of great actors such as Ed Harris, Charles Frank, Barbara Hershey a truly ensemble cast. Two cast members stand out the superb Kim Stanley one of the great all time actresses and Dennis Quaid who is memorable as Gordon Cooper. The ending is one of the best ever of all time. I also want to mention the thrilling score of the film. Memorable! I love this movie and as a Veteran of our Armed Forces, the greatest in the World, it is a paen to Aemrica and to the valor of the American Military!. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This Movie should have won the Academy Award, not its competitor Terms of Endearment.

    This is one of my favourite movies but it is not perfect but that has more to do with the book on which it is based. Tom Wolfe doesn't seem to be sure about whether he wants to write about breaking the sound barrier or the early days of the space program which makes it somewhat bi-polar. I tend to view it as two movies in one and can separate and appreciate both aspects. On the whole it is very well executed and certainly the desert scenes bring a realism to the early test pilot days. I am not sure about some of the acting in the astronaut sequences. I find Dennis Quaid to be especially irritating but don't know whether he is playing character to type, or over-hamming it. I thought his role could have been throttled back somewhat. I also thought the character of Lyndon Johnson was also a bit over-cooked although quite entertaining. My favourite line is when he asks Werner von Braun whether or not 'we can beat the Ruskies?' to which WVB replies 'of course, our Germans are better than their Germans'. Classic. Highly recommended and makes a good companion piece to Apollo 13 and From the Earth to the Moon.

    I caught this movie on one of the movie channels again the other night, and realized how much I love this movie. I am a flight/space buff so of course it appeals to me. But aside from that, the acting, special effects, story line, everything is good to the point of making it a good film. It has just the right mix of seriousness and comic relief to make it enjoyable to watch and entertaining as well. The movie shows how pitifully far behind the Russians we were in the space race, yet we somehow managed to catch up. The one issue I have with the movie is how it portrays Gus Grissom being at fault for blowing the hatch to his capsule, while in actuality NASA concluded that he was correct. The astronauts had to punch a large switch with the side of their closed fist to blow the hatch, leaving tell-tale bruising on their hands. Grissom never had any bruising on his hand so could not have blown the hatch himself. However, this is one of those movies which I've seen several times, but every time it comes on again I'll want to sit and watch the whole thing.

    I am a movie fanatic and this movie is one of my all time favorites. I loved how this movie had several themes going on: The best pilot did not have a college degree so he could not be considered for the project. (Yeager) All the tests they gave without having any idea which were really needed since no one had been in space before. There were some very funny scenes and suspense and emotions. One of my favorite scenes was when they all had a big bar-b-que celebration and with all the activities going on, each one of the team looks at each other and communicate without saying a word. I have seen this move at least 20 times and could watch it again tonight and enjoy it once more.

    This story broadly painted deals with the beginnings of the US space career and the first seven Mercury astronauts , being based on Tom Wolf's nonfiction novel . The space began when Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard who played legendary pilot , is actually afraid of flying) broke the sound barrier and scorching Mach 2 and following to other aviation pioneers , the Mercury mission with 7 astronauts , the suicide squadron who volunteer for astronaut training is formed by a motley cast (Fred Ward , Dennis Quaid , Lance Henriksen , Ed Harris , Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin) , showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select volunteers to be in it. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to surpass at their trail of glory in the sky . Electrifying film with credible interpretations but overlong and oddly uninvolving , based on Tom Wolfe's ambitious book about the history of the U.S. Space program , it reads like a novel . However , Tom Wolfe, was unhappy with the film because he felt it made too many changes to the book. William Goldman, the original screenwriter before he left the project also disliked it because he didn't like the way Philip Kaufman portrayed Chuck Yeager as the only hero in the film, while the rest of the astronauts only got lucky and didn't match up to him in any way. The film has that same fictional quality ; furthermore is thrilling , imaginative , rowdy and overlong -at more than three hours , including unnecessary material - all at once . The picture attempts hardly to tell the tale of human beings as well as the space conquest . The movie tries to narrate parallel stories , though it never quite successfully integrate them . It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager -Sam Shepard- as a test pilot of the old breed , giving a nice and charming performance . It provides an all-star-cast who bolster a fine movie with special mention to Ed Harris playing John Glen who subsequently was running for President . The main cast is perfectly completed by known secondaries as Barbara Hershey , Pamela Reed , Veronica Cartwright , Kathy Baker , David Clennon , Scott Wilson , Jeff Goldblum , Royal Dano , Donald Moffat among others . Special effects work and production design by Geoffrey Kirkland is spectacular and could hardly be bettered ; however , some moments relies heavily from stock-shots . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Caleb Deschanel , the role of Annie Glenn was the first film role for his wife , Mary Jo Deschanel . Imaginative and evocative musical score composed and conducted by Bill Conti . The film's music temp track consisted of music from Holst's The Planets, Henry Mancini's score for The White Dawn and various other classical pieces which were favorites of Director 'Philip Kaufman'. &uml;Right stuff&uml; results to be Philip Kaufman's one of the most successful films . He's a good filmmaker and little prolific who left some great moments in histories that not be forgotten , giving enough inspired images to make linger in the memory such as happens in &uml;Right stuff&uml; . Kaufman realized a Western &uml;Great Northfield Minnessota Raid&uml;, a youthful tale as &uml;The Wanderers&uml;, Sci-Fi &uml; as &uml;Invasion body snatchers&uml;and two sexual stories &uml;Unbearable lightness of being&uml; and &uml;Henry and June&uml;.

    Never really understood why some people are treating astronauts like real life heroes but after watching "The Right Stuff" I always get a better sense and understanding of it! This has always really been one of my favorite movies to watch and one that I'm literally always in the mood for. And this is quite an accomplishment for a movie that is well over 3 hours long! It's just simply one that never drags or starts to become uninteresting at any point, due to the incredible diversity in its story and with its many characters. I think the biggest reason why this movie works out so well is due to how it finds a perfect balance, with basically everything in it. You could really say that the movie is being very heroic and patriotic but at the same time it also shows all of the flaws of the characters and how things went very wrong at times, due to human error or even sheer stupidity at times. The movie is balanced like this with about everything! The movie is a serious one and of course based on true stories but yet it is being brought as great entertainment, with also plenty of comical situations in it. The movie is never too dramatic or heavy but also never too goofy or comical. It's a real pleasant balance that works out oh so well for this movie. It's really great how this movie is telling an important true historical story, by telling it in a mostly very entertaining way. I believe that because of this, this movie works out 10 times better and more interesting, as it would had, had it been done as a complete serious and very straightforward 3 hour+ historical epic. It also gives "The Right Stuff" so much re-playability value to it! It's truly a movie you can watch over and over again and get grabbed by it every time. It's still really a respectful movie toward the first astronauts, as well as to the test-pilots of the '40's/'50's, who pretty much were the predecessors of the first astronauts and did lots of important and dangerously groundbreaking stuff to get the first space program off the ground. It's equally paying attention to most of the first astronauts, as well as to test-pilot Chuck Yeager. It's hard to say who plays the lead role of this movie really, since there is not one main character, that it constantly follows, throughout the entire movie. It also follows the stories of the women behind the men, who of course were just as important and had to endure a lot. Basically all of the characters are really likable ones because they are portrayed like real humans, each with their own flaws and needs. It was refreshing to see real men as astronauts for a change. Men who enjoyed having a drink, the night before they had to go up into space, as opposed to all of the generic and serious scientists they are blasting off into space now days. It makes me respect the earliest astronauts all the more because they were just common men, who volunteered to do some not so very common things and constantly risked their own lives to get the job done. True pioneers of our time and also true heroes in my opinion. It's also great to see them getting played by some great and well known actors, who all suit their roles very well and also often really look like the person they are playing. It's really an all-star cast, with people such as Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, Donald Moffat and Jeff Goldblum involved but it never feels like a celebrity overkill, since everyone suits their roles so extremely well. It's such a great written and fine told movie, not only by its actors but also really by its director Philip Kaufman, who directed the movie with a lot of eye for detail. I also really loved how I really couldn't tell when the movie was using real archive footage or footage shot specifically for the movie. It adds so much realism to the movie and its overall feeling and effectiveness. Something that also deserves special attention is the wonderful musical score by Bill Conti. It also earned him an Oscar and the movie won 3 more, while it got also nominated for 4 others, including best picture. This truly is how all historical, 3 hour+ long movies, should be like! 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Unfortunately, those fifteen seconds come during the last 15 seconds of the film when there's a cheesy bit of completely unnecessary narration. The film would have benefited from written information to convey what Kaufman was trying to say. The rest of the film is a 10. In the future, I will stop this film with Yeager walking, battered and bruised in the desert. The last bit of narration is just completely out of place. It's cheesy, and it's takes away from all the successful character development of the film. If the film sets any character apart, it's Yeager. The ending contradicts those efforts, and makes the last 5 minutes of the film a bit anti-climactic. Now, for the rest of it. What an EPIC movie! It's three hours of pure entertainment. The music, the overall sound, that character development, the superb pacing of the three hours; to say this film is awesome might be an understatement. I respect James L. Brooks' "Terms of Endearment". It's his best film, but I'm not quite sure how it beat-out Kaufman's "The Right Stuff" for best picture honors for 1983. It must have been close, and that last fifteen seconds of narration in TRS might have helped. The film did win Oscars for sound and score. The way Conti's score is seamlessly woven into the film is amazing. There is a great amount of detail in the visuals and the period, and the film stands up to this day without any indication of being made in 1983. If we weren't familiar with the actors - it could have been released a month ago - and without a doubt it would have been the best film of 2011. "The Right Stuff" does for the American space race what "Das Boot" did for submariners. This film basically writes the book for this subject matter. The audience roots for nearly every character in the film. The pre-cold-war undertones are rightfully downplayed to concentrate the films' focus on those involved and their gripping heroism and humanity. The film is as much of a visual feast as it is a treat for the auditory senses. All the flight sequences show the strength of Kaufman's direction as he maintains a degree of realism and minimization that doesn't detract from the film at all. Instead of unrealistic shots of models or modern-day-CGI - we get an extremely artistic and personal take of the cockpit. It's not what's going on outside of the cockpit - it's what's going on inside. And even when Kaufman ventures outside of that cockpit - it comes off as dreamlike/out-of-this-world. In that way, the film draws more from Kubrick films like CLockwork Orange, and 2001, and sends the audience into sensory over-drive. 93/100 You'll like this if you liked: JFK, The Great Escape, Apollo 13, and The King's Speech. If you don't like this - someone needs to check your pulse. Some have criticized that the film didn't flesh-out every character. In this aspect it's a strength not a weakness. We only get to know 4 of the astronauts on the cover, and the films' better for it! There can be times when a films length can be a distraction, but this is the fastest 3 hours and fifteen minutes in Hollywood history. This is an extremely "tight" film considering the number of characters, and the years and subjects covered.

The one issue I have with the movie is how it portrays Gus Grissom being at fault for blowing the hatch to his capsule, while in actuality NASA concluded that he was correct. The astronauts had to punch a large switch with the side of their closed fist to blow the hatch, leaving tell-tale bruising on their hands. Grissom never had any bruising on his hand so could not have blown the hatch himself. However, this is one of those movies which I've seen several times, but every time it comes on again I'll want to sit and watch the whole thing.

    I am a movie fanatic and this movie is one of my all time favorites. I loved how this movie had several themes going on: The best pilot did not have a college degree so he could not be considered for the project. (Yeager) All the tests they gave without having any idea which were really needed since no one had been in space before. There were some very funny scenes and suspense and emotions. One of my favorite scenes was when they all had a big bar-b-que celebration and with all the activities going on, each one of the team looks at each other and communicate without saying a word. I have seen this move at least 20 times and could watch it again tonight and enjoy it once more.

    This story broadly painted deals with the beginnings of the US space career and the first seven Mercury astronauts , being based on Tom Wolf's nonfiction novel . The space began when Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard who played legendary pilot , is actually afraid of flying) broke the sound barrier and scorching Mach 2 and following to other aviation pioneers , the Mercury mission with 7 astronauts , the suicide squadron who volunteer for astronaut training is formed by a motley cast (Fred Ward , Dennis Quaid , Lance Henriksen , Ed Harris , Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin) , showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select volunteers to be in it. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to surpass at their trail of glory in the sky . Electrifying film with credible interpretations but overlong and oddly uninvolving , based on Tom Wolfe's ambitious book about the history of the U.S. Space program , it reads like a novel . However , Tom Wolfe, was unhappy with the film because he felt it made too many changes to the book. William Goldman, the original screenwriter before he left the project also disliked it because he didn't like the way Philip Kaufman portrayed Chuck Yeager as the only hero in the film, while the rest of the astronauts only got lucky and didn't match up to him in any way. The film has that same fictional quality ; furthermore is thrilling , imaginative , rowdy and overlong -at more than three hours , including unnecessary material - all at once . The picture attempts hardly to tell the tale of human beings as well as the space conquest . The movie tries to narrate parallel stories , though it never quite successfully integrate them . It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager -Sam Shepard- as a test pilot of the old breed , giving a nice and charming performance . It provides an all-star-cast who bolster a fine movie with special mention to Ed Harris playing John Glen who subsequently was running for President . The main cast is perfectly completed by known secondaries as Barbara Hershey , Pamela Reed , Veronica Cartwright , Kathy Baker , David Clennon , Scott Wilson , Jeff Goldblum , Royal Dano , Donald Moffat among others . Special effects work and production design by Geoffrey Kirkland is spectacular and could hardly be bettered ; however , some moments relies heavily from stock-shots . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Caleb Deschanel , the role of Annie Glenn was the first film role for his wife , Mary Jo Deschanel . Imaginative and evocative musical score composed and conducted by Bill Conti . The film's music temp track consisted of music from Holst's The Planets, Henry Mancini's score for The White Dawn and various other classical pieces which were favorites of Director 'Philip Kaufman'. &uml;Right stuff&uml; results to be Philip Kaufman's one of the most successful films .

    Never really understood why some people are treating astronauts like real life heroes but after watching "The Right Stuff" I always get a better sense and understanding of it! This has always really been one of my favorite movies to watch and one that I'm literally always in the mood for. And this is quite an accomplishment for a movie that is well over 3 hours long! It's just simply one that never drags or starts to become uninteresting at any point, due to the incredible diversity in its story and with its many characters. I think the biggest reason why this movie works out so well is due to how it finds a perfect balance, with basically everything in it. You could really say that the movie is being very heroic and patriotic but at the same time it also shows all of the flaws of the characters and how things went very wrong at times, due to human error or even sheer stupidity at times. The movie is balanced like this with about everything! The movie is a serious one and of course based on true stories but yet it is being brought as great entertainment, with also plenty of comical situations in it. The movie is never too dramatic or heavy but also never too goofy or comical. It's a real pleasant balance that works out oh so well for this movie. It's really great how this movie is telling an important true historical story, by telling it in a mostly very entertaining way. I believe that because of this, this movie works out 10 times better and more interesting, as it would had, had it been done as a complete serious and very straightforward 3 hour+ historical epic. It also gives "The Right Stuff" so much re-playability value to it! It's truly a movie you can watch over and over again and get grabbed by it every time. It's still really a respectful movie toward the first astronauts, as well as to the test-pilots of the '40's/'50's, who pretty much were the predecessors of the first astronauts and did lots of important and dangerously groundbreaking stuff to get the first space program off the ground. It's equally paying attention to most of the first astronauts, as well as to test-pilot Chuck Yeager. It's hard to say who plays the lead role of this movie really, since there is not one main character, that it constantly follows, throughout the entire movie. It also follows the stories of the women behind the men, who of course were just as important and had to endure a lot. Basically all of the characters are really likable ones because they are portrayed like real humans, each with their own flaws and needs. It was refreshing to see real men as astronauts for a change. Men who enjoyed having a drink, the night before they had to go up into space, as opposed to all of the generic and serious scientists they are blasting off into space now days. It makes me respect the earliest astronauts all the more because they were just common men, who volunteered to do some not so very common things and constantly risked their own lives to get the job done. True pioneers of our time and also true heroes in my opinion. It's also great to see them getting played by some great and well known actors, who all suit their roles very well and also often really look like the person they are playing. It's really an all-star cast, with people such as Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, Donald Moffat and Jeff Goldblum involved but it never feels like a celebrity overkill, since everyone suits their roles so extremely well. It's such a great written and fine told movie, not only by its actors but also really by its director Philip Kaufman, who directed the movie with a lot of eye for detail. I also really loved how I really couldn't tell when the movie was using real archive footage or footage shot specifically for the movie. It adds so much realism to the movie and its overall feeling and effectiveness. Something that also deserves special attention is the wonderful musical score by Bill Conti. It also earned him an Oscar and the movie won 3 more, while it got also nominated for 4 others, including best picture. This truly is how all historical, 3 hour+ long movies, should be like! 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Unfortunately, those fifteen seconds come during the last 15 seconds of the film when there's a cheesy bit of completely unnecessary narration. The film would have benefited from written information to convey what Kaufman was trying to say. The rest of the film is a 10. In the future, I will stop this film with Yeager walking, battered and bruised in the desert. The last bit of narration is just completely out of place. It's cheesy, and it's takes away from all the successful character development of the film. If the film sets any character apart, it's Yeager. The ending contradicts those efforts, and makes the last 5 minutes of the film a bit anti-climactic. Now, for the rest of it. What an EPIC movie! It's three hours of pure entertainment. The music, the overall sound, that character development, the superb pacing of the three hours; to say this film is awesome might be an understatement. I respect James L. Brooks' "Terms of Endearment". It's his best film, but I'm not quite sure how it beat-out Kaufman's "The Right Stuff" for best picture honors for 1983. It must have been close, and that last fifteen seconds of narration in TRS might have helped. The film did win Oscars for sound and score. The way Conti's score is seamlessly woven into the film is amazing. There is a great amount of detail in the visuals and the period, and the film stands up to this day without any indication of being made in 1983. If we weren't familiar with the actors - it could have been released a month ago - and without a doubt it would have been the best film of 2011. "The Right Stuff" does for the American space race what "Das Boot" did for submariners. This film basically writes the book for this subject matter. The audience roots for nearly every character in the film. The pre-cold-war undertones are rightfully downplayed to concentrate the films' focus on those involved and their gripping heroism and humanity. The film is as much of a visual feast as it is a treat for the auditory senses. All the flight sequences show the strength of Kaufman's direction as he maintains a degree of realism and minimization that doesn't detract from the film at all. Instead of unrealistic shots of models or modern-day-CGI - we get an extremely artistic and personal take of the cockpit. It's not what's going on outside of the cockpit - it's what's going on inside. And even when Kaufman ventures outside of that cockpit - it comes off as dreamlike/out-of-this-world. In that way, the film draws more from Kubrick films like CLockwork Orange, and 2001, and sends the audience into sensory over-drive. 93/100 You'll like this if you liked: JFK, The Great Escape, Apollo 13, and The King's Speech. If you don't like this - someone needs to check your pulse. Some have criticized that the film didn't flesh-out every character. In this aspect it's a strength not a weakness. We only get to know 4 of the astronauts on the cover, and the films' better for it! There can be times when a films length can be a distraction, but this is the fastest 3 hours and fifteen minutes in Hollywood history. This is an extremely "tight" film considering the number of characters, and the years and subjects covered.

    Philip Kaufman's soaring adaptation of Tom Wolfe's biographical account of the space program, starting with Chuck Yeager's(played by Sam Shepherd) breaking the sound barrier, to the Mercury 7, the first American astronauts(played by Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Lance Henriksen, and others) to go into outer space. Film details the process of selection and training involved in preparing the astronauts for flight, as well as focusing on how they handle the media and each other. They are portrayed as real men, not cardboard cutouts, which is refreshing. A very well directed, written, and acted film is truly inspiring in how it portrays the successes and failures of these brave men, and the women in their lives. Though over three hours, it doesn't drag much, and is a most satisfying true story.

    "Is that a man?" asks the pilot of a rescue plane headed towards the crash site of Chuck Yeager's attempt to reach the edge of space in a Lockheed NF-104A. An outline of a man appears on the horizon, blurred by heat and mirage, his face bloody and burned, walking at pace with his helmet in his hand. Yeager's good friend Jack Ridley sits in the passenger seat, having seen Yeager conquer several near-suicidal flight records, including the first to break the sound barrier. Ridley smiles. "You're damn right it is!". The Right Stuff, adapted from Tom Wolfe's best-selling account of the test-pilots in the Mercury Space Program, shows what it takes to be a man; to have the 'right stuff' inhabited by these fearless men, who were the only ones crazy enough to risk everything, on live TV, to beat the Russians in the space race. Besides the many fascinating and frequently hilarious vignettes involving the test pilots - played by a stellar cast of Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Charles Frank, Lance Henriksen, Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin - the movie's real ace-in-the-hole is the juxtaposition of this story with that of Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a man thought of by his peers to be the finest pilot in the world. Played stoically by an Oscar- nominated Sam Shepard, he is brooding, dusty, a true man's man, but without the college degree needed to join the space program. He is the polar opposite of the 'hot dog's' of the Mercury Program, and when he is not off chasing his wild wife Glennis (Barbara Hershey), he is making sure he is still the fastest man in the world. Even at over 3 hours, the movie is packed with great and memorable scenes. Director Philip Kaufman managed to retain Wolfe's skill for absurd humour, so we get to see the President crawling on the floor to plug in a projector, two astronauts' slow walk to the bathroom following an enema, and a hilarious moment involving humming and sperm samples. It has an observational aesthetic that America conquered in the 1970's, made even better by some amazing aviation and space travel scenes, easily more exciting than the CGI-laden movies we get nowadays. It's often called the second-best movie of the 1980's behind Raging Bull (1980), and, although I don't necessarily agree with that statement (Blue Velvet (1986), anyone?), it's one of the finest movies to come out of it's era, feeling almost classical despite being modern. Like Shepard's Chuck Yeager, The Right Stuff seems old before its time, encompassing wisdom and poignancy with ease. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Writer/director Phil Kaufman makes the mistake of simply reading Tom Wolfe's excellent novel of the same name, and then filming this movie accordingly. This was a recipe for disaster. Wolfe talks a lot about astronaut Gordon Cooper, but in no way was Cooper the 'center' of the early western space program and Wolfe did not imply such a thing. All original seven astronauts were equally responsible for the program's success, yet Kaufman interprets Cooper's involvement as being the most important.... wrong. Cooper is mentioned near the end of the novel, so Kaufman ended his film with a red, white, and blue fanfare to present Cooper's flight as the pinnacle of everything cosmic. Apparently Kaufman did not research his subject. Good points: attention to period detail and the cameo appearance of General Chuck Yeager as a bartender.

    Director Phil Kaufmann and Producer Alan Ladd brought to the screen a movie masterpiece in The Right Stuff. Starring Sam Shephard and a roster of great actors such as Ed Harris, Charles Frank, Barbara Hershey a truly ensemble cast. Two cast members stand out the superb Kim Stanley one of the great all time actresses and Dennis Quaid who is memorable as Gordon Cooper. The ending is one of the best ever of all time. I also want to mention the thrilling score of the film. Memorable! I love this movie and as a Veteran of our Armed Forces, the greatest in the World, it is a paen to Aemrica and to the valor of the American Military!. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This Movie should have won the Academy Award, not its competitor Terms of Endearment.

    This is one of my favourite movies but it is not perfect but that has more to do with the book on which it is based. Tom Wolfe doesn't seem to be sure about whether he wants to write about breaking the sound barrier or the early days of the space program which makes it somewhat bi-polar. I tend to view it as two movies in one and can separate and appreciate both aspects. On the whole it is very well executed and certainly the desert scenes bring a realism to the early test pilot days. I am not sure about some of the acting in the astronaut sequences. I find Dennis Quaid to be especially irritating but don't know whether he is playing character to type, or over-hamming it. I thought his role could have been throttled back somewhat. I also thought the character of Lyndon Johnson was also a bit over-cooked although quite entertaining. My favourite line is when he asks Werner von Braun whether or not 'we can beat the Ruskies?' to which WVB replies 'of course, our Germans are better than their Germans'. Classic. Highly recommended and makes a good companion piece to Apollo 13 and From the Earth to the Moon.

    I caught this movie on one of the movie channels again the other night, and realized how much I love this movie. I am a flight/space buff so of course it appeals to me. But aside from that, the acting, special effects, story line, everything is good to the point of making it a good film. It has just the right mix of seriousness and comic relief to make it enjoyable to watch and entertaining as well.

Brooks' "Terms of Endearment". It's his best film, but I'm not quite sure how it beat-out Kaufman's "The Right Stuff" for best picture honors for 1983. It must have been close, and that last fifteen seconds of narration in TRS might have helped. The film did win Oscars for sound and score. The way Conti's score is seamlessly woven into the film is amazing. There is a great amount of detail in the visuals and the period, and the film stands up to this day without any indication of being made in 1983. If we weren't familiar with the actors - it could have been released a month ago - and without a doubt it would have been the best film of 2011. "The Right Stuff" does for the American space race what "Das Boot" did for submariners. This film basically writes the book for this subject matter. The audience roots for nearly every character in the film. The pre-cold-war undertones are rightfully downplayed to concentrate the films' focus on those involved and their gripping heroism and humanity. The film is as much of a visual feast as it is a treat for the auditory senses. All the flight sequences show the strength of Kaufman's direction as he maintains a degree of realism and minimization that doesn't detract from the film at all. Instead of unrealistic shots of models or modern-day-CGI - we get an extremely artistic and personal take of the cockpit. It's not what's going on outside of the cockpit - it's what's going on inside. And even when Kaufman ventures outside of that cockpit - it comes off as dreamlike/out-of-this-world. In that way, the film draws more from Kubrick films like CLockwork Orange, and 2001, and sends the audience into sensory over-drive. 93/100 You'll like this if you liked: JFK, The Great Escape, Apollo 13, and The King's Speech. If you don't like this - someone needs to check your pulse. Some have criticized that the film didn't flesh-out every character. In this aspect it's a strength not a weakness. We only get to know 4 of the astronauts on the cover, and the films' better for it! There can be times when a films length can be a distraction, but this is the fastest 3 hours and fifteen minutes in Hollywood history. This is an extremely "tight" film considering the number of characters, and the years and subjects covered.

    Philip Kaufman's soaring adaptation of Tom Wolfe's biographical account of the space program, starting with Chuck Yeager's(played by Sam Shepherd) breaking the sound barrier, to the Mercury 7, the first American astronauts(played by Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Lance Henriksen, and others) to go into outer space. Film details the process of selection and training involved in preparing the astronauts for flight, as well as focusing on how they handle the media and each other. They are portrayed as real men, not cardboard cutouts, which is refreshing. A very well directed, written, and acted film is truly inspiring in how it portrays the successes and failures of these brave men, and the women in their lives. Though over three hours, it doesn't drag much, and is a most satisfying true story.

    "Is that a man?" asks the pilot of a rescue plane headed towards the crash site of Chuck Yeager's attempt to reach the edge of space in a Lockheed NF-104A. An outline of a man appears on the horizon, blurred by heat and mirage, his face bloody and burned, walking at pace with his helmet in his hand. Yeager's good friend Jack Ridley sits in the passenger seat, having seen Yeager conquer several near-suicidal flight records, including the first to break the sound barrier. Ridley smiles. "You're damn right it is!". The Right Stuff, adapted from Tom Wolfe's best-selling account of the test-pilots in the Mercury Space Program, shows what it takes to be a man; to have the 'right stuff' inhabited by these fearless men, who were the only ones crazy enough to risk everything, on live TV, to beat the Russians in the space race. Besides the many fascinating and frequently hilarious vignettes involving the test pilots - played by a stellar cast of Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Charles Frank, Lance Henriksen, Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin - the movie's real ace-in-the-hole is the juxtaposition of this story with that of Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a man thought of by his peers to be the finest pilot in the world. Played stoically by an Oscar- nominated Sam Shepard, he is brooding, dusty, a true man's man, but without the college degree needed to join the space program. He is the polar opposite of the 'hot dog's' of the Mercury Program, and when he is not off chasing his wild wife Glennis (Barbara Hershey), he is making sure he is still the fastest man in the world. Even at over 3 hours, the movie is packed with great and memorable scenes. Director Philip Kaufman managed to retain Wolfe's skill for absurd humour, so we get to see the President crawling on the floor to plug in a projector, two astronauts' slow walk to the bathroom following an enema, and a hilarious moment involving humming and sperm samples. It has an observational aesthetic that America conquered in the 1970's, made even better by some amazing aviation and space travel scenes, easily more exciting than the CGI-laden movies we get nowadays. It's often called the second-best movie of the 1980's behind Raging Bull (1980), and, although I don't necessarily agree with that statement (Blue Velvet (1986), anyone?), it's one of the finest movies to come out of it's era, feeling almost classical despite being modern. Like Shepard's Chuck Yeager, The Right Stuff seems old before its time, encompassing wisdom and poignancy with ease. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Writer/director Phil Kaufman makes the mistake of simply reading Tom Wolfe's excellent novel of the same name, and then filming this movie accordingly. This was a recipe for disaster. Wolfe talks a lot about astronaut Gordon Cooper, but in no way was Cooper the 'center' of the early western space program and Wolfe did not imply such a thing. All original seven astronauts were equally responsible for the program's success, yet Kaufman interprets Cooper's involvement as being the most important.... wrong. Cooper is mentioned near the end of the novel, so Kaufman ended his film with a red, white, and blue fanfare to present Cooper's flight as the pinnacle of everything cosmic. Apparently Kaufman did not research his subject. Good points: attention to period detail and the cameo appearance of General Chuck Yeager as a bartender.

    Director Phil Kaufmann and Producer Alan Ladd brought to the screen a movie masterpiece in The Right Stuff. Starring Sam Shephard and a roster of great actors such as Ed Harris, Charles Frank, Barbara Hershey a truly ensemble cast. Two cast members stand out the superb Kim Stanley one of the great all time actresses and Dennis Quaid who is memorable as Gordon Cooper. The ending is one of the best ever of all time. I also want to mention the thrilling score of the film. Memorable! I love this movie and as a Veteran of our Armed Forces, the greatest in the World, it is a paen to Aemrica and to the valor of the American Military!. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This Movie should have won the Academy Award, not its competitor Terms of Endearment.

    This is one of my favourite movies but it is not perfect but that has more to do with the book on which it is based. Tom Wolfe doesn't seem to be sure about whether he wants to write about breaking the sound barrier or the early days of the space program which makes it somewhat bi-polar. I tend to view it as two movies in one and can separate and appreciate both aspects. On the whole it is very well executed and certainly the desert scenes bring a realism to the early test pilot days. I am not sure about some of the acting in the astronaut sequences. I find Dennis Quaid to be especially irritating but don't know whether he is playing character to type, or over-hamming it. I thought his role could have been throttled back somewhat. I also thought the character of Lyndon Johnson was also a bit over-cooked although quite entertaining. My favourite line is when he asks Werner von Braun whether or not 'we can beat the Ruskies?' to which WVB replies 'of course, our Germans are better than their Germans'. Classic. Highly recommended and makes a good companion piece to Apollo 13 and From the Earth to the Moon.

    I caught this movie on one of the movie channels again the other night, and realized how much I love this movie. I am a flight/space buff so of course it appeals to me. But aside from that, the acting, special effects, story line, everything is good to the point of making it a good film. It has just the right mix of seriousness and comic relief to make it enjoyable to watch and entertaining as well. The movie shows how pitifully far behind the Russians we were in the space race, yet we somehow managed to catch up. The one issue I have with the movie is how it portrays Gus Grissom being at fault for blowing the hatch to his capsule, while in actuality NASA concluded that he was correct. The astronauts had to punch a large switch with the side of their closed fist to blow the hatch, leaving tell-tale bruising on their hands. Grissom never had any bruising on his hand so could not have blown the hatch himself. However, this is one of those movies which I've seen several times, but every time it comes on again I'll want to sit and watch the whole thing.

    I am a movie fanatic and this movie is one of my all time favorites. I loved how this movie had several themes going on: The best pilot did not have a college degree so he could not be considered for the project. (Yeager) All the tests they gave without having any idea which were really needed since no one had been in space before. There were some very funny scenes and suspense and emotions. One of my favorite scenes was when they all had a big bar-b-que celebration and with all the activities going on, each one of the team looks at each other and communicate without saying a word. I have seen this move at least 20 times and could watch it again tonight and enjoy it once more.

    This story broadly painted deals with the beginnings of the US space career and the first seven Mercury astronauts , being based on Tom Wolf's nonfiction novel . The space began when Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard who played legendary pilot , is actually afraid of flying) broke the sound barrier and scorching Mach 2 and following to other aviation pioneers , the Mercury mission with 7 astronauts , the suicide squadron who volunteer for astronaut training is formed by a motley cast (Fred Ward , Dennis Quaid , Lance Henriksen , Ed Harris , Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin) , showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select volunteers to be in it. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to surpass at their trail of glory in the sky . Electrifying film with credible interpretations but overlong and oddly uninvolving , based on Tom Wolfe's ambitious book about the history of the U.S. Space program , it reads like a novel . However , Tom Wolfe, was unhappy with the film because he felt it made too many changes to the book. William Goldman, the original screenwriter before he left the project also disliked it because he didn't like the way Philip Kaufman portrayed Chuck Yeager as the only hero in the film, while the rest of the astronauts only got lucky and didn't match up to him in any way. The film has that same fictional quality ; furthermore is thrilling , imaginative , rowdy and overlong -at more than three hours , including unnecessary material - all at once . The picture attempts hardly to tell the tale of human beings as well as the space conquest . The movie tries to narrate parallel stories , though it never quite successfully integrate them . It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager -Sam Shepard- as a test pilot of the old breed , giving a nice and charming performance . It provides an all-star-cast who bolster a fine movie with special mention to Ed Harris playing John Glen who subsequently was running for President . The main cast is perfectly completed by known secondaries as Barbara Hershey , Pamela Reed , Veronica Cartwright , Kathy Baker , David Clennon , Scott Wilson , Jeff Goldblum , Royal Dano , Donald Moffat among others . Special effects work and production design by Geoffrey Kirkland is spectacular and could hardly be bettered ; however , some moments relies heavily from stock-shots . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Caleb Deschanel , the role of Annie Glenn was the first film role for his wife , Mary Jo Deschanel . Imaginative and evocative musical score composed and conducted by Bill Conti . The film's music temp track consisted of music from Holst's The Planets, Henry Mancini's score for The White Dawn and various other classical pieces which were favorites of Director 'Philip Kaufman'. &uml;Right stuff&uml; results to be Philip Kaufman's one of the most successful films . He's a good filmmaker and little prolific who left some great moments in histories that not be forgotten , giving enough inspired images to make linger in the memory such as happens in &uml;Right stuff&uml; . Kaufman realized a Western &uml;Great Northfield Minnessota Raid&uml;, a youthful tale as &uml;The Wanderers&uml;, Sci-Fi &uml; as &uml;Invasion body snatchers&uml;and two sexual stories &uml;Unbearable lightness of being&uml; and &uml;Henry and June&uml;.

    Never really understood why some people are treating astronauts like real life heroes but after watching "The Right Stuff" I always get a better sense and understanding of it! This has always really been one of my favorite movies to watch and one that I'm literally always in the mood for. And this is quite an accomplishment for a movie that is well over 3 hours long! It's just simply one that never drags or starts to become uninteresting at any point, due to the incredible diversity in its story and with its many characters. I think the biggest reason why this movie works out so well is due to how it finds a perfect balance, with basically everything in it. You could really say that the movie is being very heroic and patriotic but at the same time it also shows all of the flaws of the characters and how things went very wrong at times, due to human error or even sheer stupidity at times. The movie is balanced like this with about everything! The movie is a serious one and of course based on true stories but yet it is being brought as great entertainment, with also plenty of comical situations in it. The movie is never too dramatic or heavy but also never too goofy or comical. It's a real pleasant balance that works out oh so well for this movie. It's really great how this movie is telling an important true historical story, by telling it in a mostly very entertaining way. I believe that because of this, this movie works out 10 times better and more interesting, as it would had, had it been done as a complete serious and very straightforward 3 hour+ historical epic. It also gives "The Right Stuff" so much re-playability value to it! It's truly a movie you can watch over and over again and get grabbed by it every time. It's still really a respectful movie toward the first astronauts, as well as to the test-pilots of the '40's/'50's, who pretty much were the predecessors of the first astronauts and did lots of important and dangerously groundbreaking stuff to get the first space program off the ground. It's equally paying attention to most of the first astronauts, as well as to test-pilot Chuck Yeager. It's hard to say who plays the lead role of this movie really, since there is not one main character, that it constantly follows, throughout the entire movie. It also follows the stories of the women behind the men, who of course were just as important and had to endure a lot. Basically all of the characters are really likable ones because they are portrayed like real humans, each with their own flaws and needs. It was refreshing to see real men as astronauts for a change. Men who enjoyed having a drink, the night before they had to go up into space, as opposed to all of the generic and serious scientists they are blasting off into space now days. It makes me respect the earliest astronauts all the more because they were just common men, who volunteered to do some not so very common things and constantly risked their own lives to get the job done. True pioneers of our time and also true heroes in my opinion. It's also great to see them getting played by some great and well known actors, who all suit their roles very well and also often really look like the person they are playing. It's really an all-star cast, with people such as Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, Donald Moffat and Jeff Goldblum involved but it never feels like a celebrity overkill, since everyone suits their roles so extremely well. It's such a great written and fine told movie, not only by its actors but also really by its director Philip Kaufman, who directed the movie with a lot of eye for detail. I also really loved how I really couldn't tell when the movie was using real archive footage or footage shot specifically for the movie. It adds so much realism to the movie and its overall feeling and effectiveness. Something that also deserves special attention is the wonderful musical score by Bill Conti. It also earned him an Oscar and the movie won 3 more, while it got also nominated for 4 others, including best picture. This truly is how all historical, 3 hour+ long movies, should be like! 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Unfortunately, those fifteen seconds come during the last 15 seconds of the film when there's a cheesy bit of completely unnecessary narration. The film would have benefited from written information to convey what Kaufman was trying to say. The rest of the film is a 10. In the future, I will stop this film with Yeager walking, battered and bruised in the desert. The last bit of narration is just completely out of place. It's cheesy, and it's takes away from all the successful character development of the film. If the film sets any character apart, it's Yeager. The ending contradicts those efforts, and makes the last 5 minutes of the film a bit anti-climactic. Now, for the rest of it. What an EPIC movie! It's three hours of pure entertainment. The music, the overall sound, that character development, the superb pacing of the three hours; to say this film is awesome might be an understatement. I respect James L.

But aside from that, the acting, special effects, story line, everything is good to the point of making it a good film. It has just the right mix of seriousness and comic relief to make it enjoyable to watch and entertaining as well. The movie shows how pitifully far behind the Russians we were in the space race, yet we somehow managed to catch up. The one issue I have with the movie is how it portrays Gus Grissom being at fault for blowing the hatch to his capsule, while in actuality NASA concluded that he was correct. The astronauts had to punch a large switch with the side of their closed fist to blow the hatch, leaving tell-tale bruising on their hands. Grissom never had any bruising on his hand so could not have blown the hatch himself. However, this is one of those movies which I've seen several times, but every time it comes on again I'll want to sit and watch the whole thing.

    I am a movie fanatic and this movie is one of my all time favorites. I loved how this movie had several themes going on: The best pilot did not have a college degree so he could not be considered for the project. (Yeager) All the tests they gave without having any idea which were really needed since no one had been in space before. There were some very funny scenes and suspense and emotions. One of my favorite scenes was when they all had a big bar-b-que celebration and with all the activities going on, each one of the team looks at each other and communicate without saying a word. I have seen this move at least 20 times and could watch it again tonight and enjoy it once more.

    This story broadly painted deals with the beginnings of the US space career and the first seven Mercury astronauts , being based on Tom Wolf's nonfiction novel . The space began when Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard who played legendary pilot , is actually afraid of flying) broke the sound barrier and scorching Mach 2 and following to other aviation pioneers , the Mercury mission with 7 astronauts , the suicide squadron who volunteer for astronaut training is formed by a motley cast (Fred Ward , Dennis Quaid , Lance Henriksen , Ed Harris , Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin) , showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select volunteers to be in it. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to surpass at their trail of glory in the sky . Electrifying film with credible interpretations but overlong and oddly uninvolving , based on Tom Wolfe's ambitious book about the history of the U.S. Space program , it reads like a novel . However , Tom Wolfe, was unhappy with the film because he felt it made too many changes to the book. William Goldman, the original screenwriter before he left the project also disliked it because he didn't like the way Philip Kaufman portrayed Chuck Yeager as the only hero in the film, while the rest of the astronauts only got lucky and didn't match up to him in any way. The film has that same fictional quality ; furthermore is thrilling , imaginative , rowdy and overlong -at more than three hours , including unnecessary material - all at once . The picture attempts hardly to tell the tale of human beings as well as the space conquest . The movie tries to narrate parallel stories , though it never quite successfully integrate them . It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager -Sam Shepard- as a test pilot of the old breed , giving a nice and charming performance . It provides an all-star-cast who bolster a fine movie with special mention to Ed Harris playing John Glen who subsequently was running for President . The main cast is perfectly completed by known secondaries as Barbara Hershey , Pamela Reed , Veronica Cartwright , Kathy Baker , David Clennon , Scott Wilson , Jeff Goldblum , Royal Dano , Donald Moffat among others . Special effects work and production design by Geoffrey Kirkland is spectacular and could hardly be bettered ; however , some moments relies heavily from stock-shots . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Caleb Deschanel , the role of Annie Glenn was the first film role for his wife , Mary Jo Deschanel . Imaginative and evocative musical score composed and conducted by Bill Conti . The film's music temp track consisted of music from Holst's The Planets, Henry Mancini's score for The White Dawn and various other classical pieces which were favorites of Director 'Philip Kaufman'. &uml;Right stuff&uml; results to be Philip Kaufman's one of the most successful films . He's a good filmmaker and little prolific who left some great moments in histories that not be forgotten , giving enough inspired images to make linger in the memory such as happens in &uml;Right stuff&uml; .

    Never really understood why some people are treating astronauts like real life heroes but after watching "The Right Stuff" I always get a better sense and understanding of it! This has always really been one of my favorite movies to watch and one that I'm literally always in the mood for. And this is quite an accomplishment for a movie that is well over 3 hours long! It's just simply one that never drags or starts to become uninteresting at any point, due to the incredible diversity in its story and with its many characters. I think the biggest reason why this movie works out so well is due to how it finds a perfect balance, with basically everything in it. You could really say that the movie is being very heroic and patriotic but at the same time it also shows all of the flaws of the characters and how things went very wrong at times, due to human error or even sheer stupidity at times. The movie is balanced like this with about everything! The movie is a serious one and of course based on true stories but yet it is being brought as great entertainment, with also plenty of comical situations in it. The movie is never too dramatic or heavy but also never too goofy or comical. It's a real pleasant balance that works out oh so well for this movie. It's really great how this movie is telling an important true historical story, by telling it in a mostly very entertaining way. I believe that because of this, this movie works out 10 times better and more interesting, as it would had, had it been done as a complete serious and very straightforward 3 hour+ historical epic. It also gives "The Right Stuff" so much re-playability value to it! It's truly a movie you can watch over and over again and get grabbed by it every time. It's still really a respectful movie toward the first astronauts, as well as to the test-pilots of the '40's/'50's, who pretty much were the predecessors of the first astronauts and did lots of important and dangerously groundbreaking stuff to get the first space program off the ground. It's equally paying attention to most of the first astronauts, as well as to test-pilot Chuck Yeager. It's hard to say who plays the lead role of this movie really, since there is not one main character, that it constantly follows, throughout the entire movie. It also follows the stories of the women behind the men, who of course were just as important and had to endure a lot. Basically all of the characters are really likable ones because they are portrayed like real humans, each with their own flaws and needs. It was refreshing to see real men as astronauts for a change. Men who enjoyed having a drink, the night before they had to go up into space, as opposed to all of the generic and serious scientists they are blasting off into space now days. It makes me respect the earliest astronauts all the more because they were just common men, who volunteered to do some not so very common things and constantly risked their own lives to get the job done. True pioneers of our time and also true heroes in my opinion. It's also great to see them getting played by some great and well known actors, who all suit their roles very well and also often really look like the person they are playing. It's really an all-star cast, with people such as Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, Donald Moffat and Jeff Goldblum involved but it never feels like a celebrity overkill, since everyone suits their roles so extremely well. It's such a great written and fine told movie, not only by its actors but also really by its director Philip Kaufman, who directed the movie with a lot of eye for detail. I also really loved how I really couldn't tell when the movie was using real archive footage or footage shot specifically for the movie. It adds so much realism to the movie and its overall feeling and effectiveness. Something that also deserves special attention is the wonderful musical score by Bill Conti. It also earned him an Oscar and the movie won 3 more, while it got also nominated for 4 others, including best picture. This truly is how all historical, 3 hour+ long movies, should be like! 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Unfortunately, those fifteen seconds come during the last 15 seconds of the film when there's a cheesy bit of completely unnecessary narration. The film would have benefited from written information to convey what Kaufman was trying to say. The rest of the film is a 10. In the future, I will stop this film with Yeager walking, battered and bruised in the desert. The last bit of narration is just completely out of place. It's cheesy, and it's takes away from all the successful character development of the film. If the film sets any character apart, it's Yeager. The ending contradicts those efforts, and makes the last 5 minutes of the film a bit anti-climactic. Now, for the rest of it. What an EPIC movie! It's three hours of pure entertainment. The music, the overall sound, that character development, the superb pacing of the three hours; to say this film is awesome might be an understatement. I respect James L. Brooks' "Terms of Endearment". It's his best film, but I'm not quite sure how it beat-out Kaufman's "The Right Stuff" for best picture honors for 1983. It must have been close, and that last fifteen seconds of narration in TRS might have helped. The film did win Oscars for sound and score. The way Conti's score is seamlessly woven into the film is amazing. There is a great amount of detail in the visuals and the period, and the film stands up to this day without any indication of being made in 1983. If we weren't familiar with the actors - it could have been released a month ago - and without a doubt it would have been the best film of 2011. "The Right Stuff" does for the American space race what "Das Boot" did for submariners. This film basically writes the book for this subject matter. The audience roots for nearly every character in the film. The pre-cold-war undertones are rightfully downplayed to concentrate the films' focus on those involved and their gripping heroism and humanity. The film is as much of a visual feast as it is a treat for the auditory senses. All the flight sequences show the strength of Kaufman's direction as he maintains a degree of realism and minimization that doesn't detract from the film at all. Instead of unrealistic shots of models or modern-day-CGI - we get an extremely artistic and personal take of the cockpit. It's not what's going on outside of the cockpit - it's what's going on inside. And even when Kaufman ventures outside of that cockpit - it comes off as dreamlike/out-of-this-world. In that way, the film draws more from Kubrick films like CLockwork Orange, and 2001, and sends the audience into sensory over-drive. 93/100 You'll like this if you liked: JFK, The Great Escape, Apollo 13, and The King's Speech. If you don't like this - someone needs to check your pulse. Some have criticized that the film didn't flesh-out every character. In this aspect it's a strength not a weakness. We only get to know 4 of the astronauts on the cover, and the films' better for it! There can be times when a films length can be a distraction, but this is the fastest 3 hours and fifteen minutes in Hollywood history. This is an extremely "tight" film considering the number of characters, and the years and subjects covered.

    Philip Kaufman's soaring adaptation of Tom Wolfe's biographical account of the space program, starting with Chuck Yeager's(played by Sam Shepherd) breaking the sound barrier, to the Mercury 7, the first American astronauts(played by Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Lance Henriksen, and others) to go into outer space. Film details the process of selection and training involved in preparing the astronauts for flight, as well as focusing on how they handle the media and each other. They are portrayed as real men, not cardboard cutouts, which is refreshing. A very well directed, written, and acted film is truly inspiring in how it portrays the successes and failures of these brave men, and the women in their lives. Though over three hours, it doesn't drag much, and is a most satisfying true story.

    "Is that a man?" asks the pilot of a rescue plane headed towards the crash site of Chuck Yeager's attempt to reach the edge of space in a Lockheed NF-104A. An outline of a man appears on the horizon, blurred by heat and mirage, his face bloody and burned, walking at pace with his helmet in his hand. Yeager's good friend Jack Ridley sits in the passenger seat, having seen Yeager conquer several near-suicidal flight records, including the first to break the sound barrier. Ridley smiles. "You're damn right it is!". The Right Stuff, adapted from Tom Wolfe's best-selling account of the test-pilots in the Mercury Space Program, shows what it takes to be a man; to have the 'right stuff' inhabited by these fearless men, who were the only ones crazy enough to risk everything, on live TV, to beat the Russians in the space race. Besides the many fascinating and frequently hilarious vignettes involving the test pilots - played by a stellar cast of Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Charles Frank, Lance Henriksen, Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin - the movie's real ace-in-the-hole is the juxtaposition of this story with that of Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a man thought of by his peers to be the finest pilot in the world. Played stoically by an Oscar- nominated Sam Shepard, he is brooding, dusty, a true man's man, but without the college degree needed to join the space program. He is the polar opposite of the 'hot dog's' of the Mercury Program, and when he is not off chasing his wild wife Glennis (Barbara Hershey), he is making sure he is still the fastest man in the world. Even at over 3 hours, the movie is packed with great and memorable scenes. Director Philip Kaufman managed to retain Wolfe's skill for absurd humour, so we get to see the President crawling on the floor to plug in a projector, two astronauts' slow walk to the bathroom following an enema, and a hilarious moment involving humming and sperm samples. It has an observational aesthetic that America conquered in the 1970's, made even better by some amazing aviation and space travel scenes, easily more exciting than the CGI-laden movies we get nowadays. It's often called the second-best movie of the 1980's behind Raging Bull (1980), and, although I don't necessarily agree with that statement (Blue Velvet (1986), anyone?), it's one of the finest movies to come out of it's era, feeling almost classical despite being modern. Like Shepard's Chuck Yeager, The Right Stuff seems old before its time, encompassing wisdom and poignancy with ease. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Writer/director Phil Kaufman makes the mistake of simply reading Tom Wolfe's excellent novel of the same name, and then filming this movie accordingly. This was a recipe for disaster. Wolfe talks a lot about astronaut Gordon Cooper, but in no way was Cooper the 'center' of the early western space program and Wolfe did not imply such a thing. All original seven astronauts were equally responsible for the program's success, yet Kaufman interprets Cooper's involvement as being the most important.... wrong. Cooper is mentioned near the end of the novel, so Kaufman ended his film with a red, white, and blue fanfare to present Cooper's flight as the pinnacle of everything cosmic. Apparently Kaufman did not research his subject. Good points: attention to period detail and the cameo appearance of General Chuck Yeager as a bartender.

    Director Phil Kaufmann and Producer Alan Ladd brought to the screen a movie masterpiece in The Right Stuff. Starring Sam Shephard and a roster of great actors such as Ed Harris, Charles Frank, Barbara Hershey a truly ensemble cast. Two cast members stand out the superb Kim Stanley one of the great all time actresses and Dennis Quaid who is memorable as Gordon Cooper. The ending is one of the best ever of all time. I also want to mention the thrilling score of the film. Memorable! I love this movie and as a Veteran of our Armed Forces, the greatest in the World, it is a paen to Aemrica and to the valor of the American Military!. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This Movie should have won the Academy Award, not its competitor Terms of Endearment.

    This is one of my favourite movies but it is not perfect but that has more to do with the book on which it is based. Tom Wolfe doesn't seem to be sure about whether he wants to write about breaking the sound barrier or the early days of the space program which makes it somewhat bi-polar. I tend to view it as two movies in one and can separate and appreciate both aspects. On the whole it is very well executed and certainly the desert scenes bring a realism to the early test pilot days. I am not sure about some of the acting in the astronaut sequences. I find Dennis Quaid to be especially irritating but don't know whether he is playing character to type, or over-hamming it. I thought his role could have been throttled back somewhat. I also thought the character of Lyndon Johnson was also a bit over-cooked although quite entertaining. My favourite line is when he asks Werner von Braun whether or not 'we can beat the Ruskies?' to which WVB replies 'of course, our Germans are better than their Germans'. Classic. Highly recommended and makes a good companion piece to Apollo 13 and From the Earth to the Moon.

The ending contradicts those efforts, and makes the last 5 minutes of the film a bit anti-climactic. Now, for the rest of it. What an EPIC movie! It's three hours of pure entertainment. The music, the overall sound, that character development, the superb pacing of the three hours; to say this film is awesome might be an understatement. I respect James L. Brooks' "Terms of Endearment". It's his best film, but I'm not quite sure how it beat-out Kaufman's "The Right Stuff" for best picture honors for 1983. It must have been close, and that last fifteen seconds of narration in TRS might have helped. The film did win Oscars for sound and score. The way Conti's score is seamlessly woven into the film is amazing. There is a great amount of detail in the visuals and the period, and the film stands up to this day without any indication of being made in 1983. If we weren't familiar with the actors - it could have been released a month ago - and without a doubt it would have been the best film of 2011. "The Right Stuff" does for the American space race what "Das Boot" did for submariners. This film basically writes the book for this subject matter. The audience roots for nearly every character in the film. The pre-cold-war undertones are rightfully downplayed to concentrate the films' focus on those involved and their gripping heroism and humanity. The film is as much of a visual feast as it is a treat for the auditory senses. All the flight sequences show the strength of Kaufman's direction as he maintains a degree of realism and minimization that doesn't detract from the film at all. Instead of unrealistic shots of models or modern-day-CGI - we get an extremely artistic and personal take of the cockpit. It's not what's going on outside of the cockpit - it's what's going on inside. And even when Kaufman ventures outside of that cockpit - it comes off as dreamlike/out-of-this-world. In that way, the film draws more from Kubrick films like CLockwork Orange, and 2001, and sends the audience into sensory over-drive. 93/100 You'll like this if you liked: JFK, The Great Escape, Apollo 13, and The King's Speech. If you don't like this - someone needs to check your pulse. Some have criticized that the film didn't flesh-out every character. In this aspect it's a strength not a weakness. We only get to know 4 of the astronauts on the cover, and the films' better for it! There can be times when a films length can be a distraction, but this is the fastest 3 hours and fifteen minutes in Hollywood history. This is an extremely "tight" film considering the number of characters, and the years and subjects covered.

    Philip Kaufman's soaring adaptation of Tom Wolfe's biographical account of the space program, starting with Chuck Yeager's(played by Sam Shepherd) breaking the sound barrier, to the Mercury 7, the first American astronauts(played by Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Lance Henriksen, and others) to go into outer space. Film details the process of selection and training involved in preparing the astronauts for flight, as well as focusing on how they handle the media and each other. They are portrayed as real men, not cardboard cutouts, which is refreshing. A very well directed, written, and acted film is truly inspiring in how it portrays the successes and failures of these brave men, and the women in their lives. Though over three hours, it doesn't drag much, and is a most satisfying true story.

    "Is that a man?" asks the pilot of a rescue plane headed towards the crash site of Chuck Yeager's attempt to reach the edge of space in a Lockheed NF-104A. An outline of a man appears on the horizon, blurred by heat and mirage, his face bloody and burned, walking at pace with his helmet in his hand. Yeager's good friend Jack Ridley sits in the passenger seat, having seen Yeager conquer several near-suicidal flight records, including the first to break the sound barrier. Ridley smiles. "You're damn right it is!". The Right Stuff, adapted from Tom Wolfe's best-selling account of the test-pilots in the Mercury Space Program, shows what it takes to be a man; to have the 'right stuff' inhabited by these fearless men, who were the only ones crazy enough to risk everything, on live TV, to beat the Russians in the space race. Besides the many fascinating and frequently hilarious vignettes involving the test pilots - played by a stellar cast of Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Charles Frank, Lance Henriksen, Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin - the movie's real ace-in-the-hole is the juxtaposition of this story with that of Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a man thought of by his peers to be the finest pilot in the world. Played stoically by an Oscar- nominated Sam Shepard, he is brooding, dusty, a true man's man, but without the college degree needed to join the space program. He is the polar opposite of the 'hot dog's' of the Mercury Program, and when he is not off chasing his wild wife Glennis (Barbara Hershey), he is making sure he is still the fastest man in the world. Even at over 3 hours, the movie is packed with great and memorable scenes. Director Philip Kaufman managed to retain Wolfe's skill for absurd humour, so we get to see the President crawling on the floor to plug in a projector, two astronauts' slow walk to the bathroom following an enema, and a hilarious moment involving humming and sperm samples. It has an observational aesthetic that America conquered in the 1970's, made even better by some amazing aviation and space travel scenes, easily more exciting than the CGI-laden movies we get nowadays. It's often called the second-best movie of the 1980's behind Raging Bull (1980), and, although I don't necessarily agree with that statement (Blue Velvet (1986), anyone?), it's one of the finest movies to come out of it's era, feeling almost classical despite being modern. Like Shepard's Chuck Yeager, The Right Stuff seems old before its time, encompassing wisdom and poignancy with ease. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Writer/director Phil Kaufman makes the mistake of simply reading Tom Wolfe's excellent novel of the same name, and then filming this movie accordingly. This was a recipe for disaster. Wolfe talks a lot about astronaut Gordon Cooper, but in no way was Cooper the 'center' of the early western space program and Wolfe did not imply such a thing. All original seven astronauts were equally responsible for the program's success, yet Kaufman interprets Cooper's involvement as being the most important.... wrong. Cooper is mentioned near the end of the novel, so Kaufman ended his film with a red, white, and blue fanfare to present Cooper's flight as the pinnacle of everything cosmic. Apparently Kaufman did not research his subject. Good points: attention to period detail and the cameo appearance of General Chuck Yeager as a bartender.

    Director Phil Kaufmann and Producer Alan Ladd brought to the screen a movie masterpiece in The Right Stuff. Starring Sam Shephard and a roster of great actors such as Ed Harris, Charles Frank, Barbara Hershey a truly ensemble cast. Two cast members stand out the superb Kim Stanley one of the great all time actresses and Dennis Quaid who is memorable as Gordon Cooper. The ending is one of the best ever of all time. I also want to mention the thrilling score of the film. Memorable! I love this movie and as a Veteran of our Armed Forces, the greatest in the World, it is a paen to Aemrica and to the valor of the American Military!. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This Movie should have won the Academy Award, not its competitor Terms of Endearment.

    This is one of my favourite movies but it is not perfect but that has more to do with the book on which it is based. Tom Wolfe doesn't seem to be sure about whether he wants to write about breaking the sound barrier or the early days of the space program which makes it somewhat bi-polar. I tend to view it as two movies in one and can separate and appreciate both aspects. On the whole it is very well executed and certainly the desert scenes bring a realism to the early test pilot days. I am not sure about some of the acting in the astronaut sequences. I find Dennis Quaid to be especially irritating but don't know whether he is playing character to type, or over-hamming it. I thought his role could have been throttled back somewhat. I also thought the character of Lyndon Johnson was also a bit over-cooked although quite entertaining. My favourite line is when he asks Werner von Braun whether or not 'we can beat the Ruskies?' to which WVB replies 'of course, our Germans are better than their Germans'. Classic. Highly recommended and makes a good companion piece to Apollo 13 and From the Earth to the Moon.

    I caught this movie on one of the movie channels again the other night, and realized how much I love this movie. I am a flight/space buff so of course it appeals to me. But aside from that, the acting, special effects, story line, everything is good to the point of making it a good film. It has just the right mix of seriousness and comic relief to make it enjoyable to watch and entertaining as well. The movie shows how pitifully far behind the Russians we were in the space race, yet we somehow managed to catch up. The one issue I have with the movie is how it portrays Gus Grissom being at fault for blowing the hatch to his capsule, while in actuality NASA concluded that he was correct. The astronauts had to punch a large switch with the side of their closed fist to blow the hatch, leaving tell-tale bruising on their hands. Grissom never had any bruising on his hand so could not have blown the hatch himself. However, this is one of those movies which I've seen several times, but every time it comes on again I'll want to sit and watch the whole thing.

    I am a movie fanatic and this movie is one of my all time favorites. I loved how this movie had several themes going on: The best pilot did not have a college degree so he could not be considered for the project. (Yeager) All the tests they gave without having any idea which were really needed since no one had been in space before. There were some very funny scenes and suspense and emotions. One of my favorite scenes was when they all had a big bar-b-que celebration and with all the activities going on, each one of the team looks at each other and communicate without saying a word. I have seen this move at least 20 times and could watch it again tonight and enjoy it once more.

    This story broadly painted deals with the beginnings of the US space career and the first seven Mercury astronauts , being based on Tom Wolf's nonfiction novel . The space began when Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard who played legendary pilot , is actually afraid of flying) broke the sound barrier and scorching Mach 2 and following to other aviation pioneers , the Mercury mission with 7 astronauts , the suicide squadron who volunteer for astronaut training is formed by a motley cast (Fred Ward , Dennis Quaid , Lance Henriksen , Ed Harris , Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin) , showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select volunteers to be in it. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to surpass at their trail of glory in the sky . Electrifying film with credible interpretations but overlong and oddly uninvolving , based on Tom Wolfe's ambitious book about the history of the U.S. Space program , it reads like a novel . However , Tom Wolfe, was unhappy with the film because he felt it made too many changes to the book. William Goldman, the original screenwriter before he left the project also disliked it because he didn't like the way Philip Kaufman portrayed Chuck Yeager as the only hero in the film, while the rest of the astronauts only got lucky and didn't match up to him in any way. The film has that same fictional quality ; furthermore is thrilling , imaginative , rowdy and overlong -at more than three hours , including unnecessary material - all at once . The picture attempts hardly to tell the tale of human beings as well as the space conquest . The movie tries to narrate parallel stories , though it never quite successfully integrate them . It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager -Sam Shepard- as a test pilot of the old breed , giving a nice and charming performance . It provides an all-star-cast who bolster a fine movie with special mention to Ed Harris playing John Glen who subsequently was running for President . The main cast is perfectly completed by known secondaries as Barbara Hershey , Pamela Reed , Veronica Cartwright , Kathy Baker , David Clennon , Scott Wilson , Jeff Goldblum , Royal Dano , Donald Moffat among others . Special effects work and production design by Geoffrey Kirkland is spectacular and could hardly be bettered ; however , some moments relies heavily from stock-shots . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Caleb Deschanel , the role of Annie Glenn was the first film role for his wife , Mary Jo Deschanel . Imaginative and evocative musical score composed and conducted by Bill Conti . The film's music temp track consisted of music from Holst's The Planets, Henry Mancini's score for The White Dawn and various other classical pieces which were favorites of Director 'Philip Kaufman'. &uml;Right stuff&uml; results to be Philip Kaufman's one of the most successful films . He's a good filmmaker and little prolific who left some great moments in histories that not be forgotten , giving enough inspired images to make linger in the memory such as happens in &uml;Right stuff&uml; . Kaufman realized a Western &uml;Great Northfield Minnessota Raid&uml;, a youthful tale as &uml;The Wanderers&uml;, Sci-Fi &uml; as &uml;Invasion body snatchers&uml;and two sexual stories &uml;Unbearable lightness of being&uml; and &uml;Henry and June&uml;.

    Never really understood why some people are treating astronauts like real life heroes but after watching "The Right Stuff" I always get a better sense and understanding of it! This has always really been one of my favorite movies to watch and one that I'm literally always in the mood for. And this is quite an accomplishment for a movie that is well over 3 hours long! It's just simply one that never drags or starts to become uninteresting at any point, due to the incredible diversity in its story and with its many characters. I think the biggest reason why this movie works out so well is due to how it finds a perfect balance, with basically everything in it. You could really say that the movie is being very heroic and patriotic but at the same time it also shows all of the flaws of the characters and how things went very wrong at times, due to human error or even sheer stupidity at times. The movie is balanced like this with about everything! The movie is a serious one and of course based on true stories but yet it is being brought as great entertainment, with also plenty of comical situations in it. The movie is never too dramatic or heavy but also never too goofy or comical. It's a real pleasant balance that works out oh so well for this movie. It's really great how this movie is telling an important true historical story, by telling it in a mostly very entertaining way. I believe that because of this, this movie works out 10 times better and more interesting, as it would had, had it been done as a complete serious and very straightforward 3 hour+ historical epic. It also gives "The Right Stuff" so much re-playability value to it! It's truly a movie you can watch over and over again and get grabbed by it every time. It's still really a respectful movie toward the first astronauts, as well as to the test-pilots of the '40's/'50's, who pretty much were the predecessors of the first astronauts and did lots of important and dangerously groundbreaking stuff to get the first space program off the ground. It's equally paying attention to most of the first astronauts, as well as to test-pilot Chuck Yeager. It's hard to say who plays the lead role of this movie really, since there is not one main character, that it constantly follows, throughout the entire movie. It also follows the stories of the women behind the men, who of course were just as important and had to endure a lot. Basically all of the characters are really likable ones because they are portrayed like real humans, each with their own flaws and needs. It was refreshing to see real men as astronauts for a change. Men who enjoyed having a drink, the night before they had to go up into space, as opposed to all of the generic and serious scientists they are blasting off into space now days. It makes me respect the earliest astronauts all the more because they were just common men, who volunteered to do some not so very common things and constantly risked their own lives to get the job done. True pioneers of our time and also true heroes in my opinion. It's also great to see them getting played by some great and well known actors, who all suit their roles very well and also often really look like the person they are playing. It's really an all-star cast, with people such as Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, Donald Moffat and Jeff Goldblum involved but it never feels like a celebrity overkill, since everyone suits their roles so extremely well. It's such a great written and fine told movie, not only by its actors but also really by its director Philip Kaufman, who directed the movie with a lot of eye for detail. I also really loved how I really couldn't tell when the movie was using real archive footage or footage shot specifically for the movie. It adds so much realism to the movie and its overall feeling and effectiveness. Something that also deserves special attention is the wonderful musical score by Bill Conti. It also earned him an Oscar and the movie won 3 more, while it got also nominated for 4 others, including best picture. This truly is how all historical, 3 hour+ long movies, should be like! 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Unfortunately, those fifteen seconds come during the last 15 seconds of the film when there's a cheesy bit of completely unnecessary narration. The film would have benefited from written information to convey what Kaufman was trying to say. The rest of the film is a 10. In the future, I will stop this film with Yeager walking, battered and bruised in the desert. The last bit of narration is just completely out of place. It's cheesy, and it's takes away from all the successful character development of the film. If the film sets any character apart, it's Yeager.

    I caught this movie on one of the movie channels again the other night, and realized how much I love this movie. I am a flight/space buff so of course it appeals to me. But aside from that, the acting, special effects, story line, everything is good to the point of making it a good film. It has just the right mix of seriousness and comic relief to make it enjoyable to watch and entertaining as well. The movie shows how pitifully far behind the Russians we were in the space race, yet we somehow managed to catch up. The one issue I have with the movie is how it portrays Gus Grissom being at fault for blowing the hatch to his capsule, while in actuality NASA concluded that he was correct. The astronauts had to punch a large switch with the side of their closed fist to blow the hatch, leaving tell-tale bruising on their hands. Grissom never had any bruising on his hand so could not have blown the hatch himself. However, this is one of those movies which I've seen several times, but every time it comes on again I'll want to sit and watch the whole thing.

    I am a movie fanatic and this movie is one of my all time favorites. I loved how this movie had several themes going on: The best pilot did not have a college degree so he could not be considered for the project. (Yeager) All the tests they gave without having any idea which were really needed since no one had been in space before. There were some very funny scenes and suspense and emotions. One of my favorite scenes was when they all had a big bar-b-que celebration and with all the activities going on, each one of the team looks at each other and communicate without saying a word. I have seen this move at least 20 times and could watch it again tonight and enjoy it once more.

    This story broadly painted deals with the beginnings of the US space career and the first seven Mercury astronauts , being based on Tom Wolf's nonfiction novel . The space began when Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard who played legendary pilot , is actually afraid of flying) broke the sound barrier and scorching Mach 2 and following to other aviation pioneers , the Mercury mission with 7 astronauts , the suicide squadron who volunteer for astronaut training is formed by a motley cast (Fred Ward , Dennis Quaid , Lance Henriksen , Ed Harris , Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin) , showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select volunteers to be in it. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to surpass at their trail of glory in the sky . Electrifying film with credible interpretations but overlong and oddly uninvolving , based on Tom Wolfe's ambitious book about the history of the U.S. Space program , it reads like a novel . However , Tom Wolfe, was unhappy with the film because he felt it made too many changes to the book. William Goldman, the original screenwriter before he left the project also disliked it because he didn't like the way Philip Kaufman portrayed Chuck Yeager as the only hero in the film, while the rest of the astronauts only got lucky and didn't match up to him in any way. The film has that same fictional quality ; furthermore is thrilling , imaginative , rowdy and overlong -at more than three hours , including unnecessary material - all at once . The picture attempts hardly to tell the tale of human beings as well as the space conquest . The movie tries to narrate parallel stories , though it never quite successfully integrate them . It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager -Sam Shepard- as a test pilot of the old breed , giving a nice and charming performance . It provides an all-star-cast who bolster a fine movie with special mention to Ed Harris playing John Glen who subsequently was running for President . The main cast is perfectly completed by known secondaries as Barbara Hershey , Pamela Reed , Veronica Cartwright , Kathy Baker , David Clennon , Scott Wilson , Jeff Goldblum , Royal Dano , Donald Moffat among others . Special effects work and production design by Geoffrey Kirkland is spectacular and could hardly be bettered ; however , some moments relies heavily from stock-shots . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Caleb Deschanel , the role of Annie Glenn was the first film role for his wife , Mary Jo Deschanel . Imaginative and evocative musical score composed and conducted by Bill Conti . The film's music temp track consisted of music from Holst's The Planets, Henry Mancini's score for The White Dawn and various other classical pieces which were favorites of Director 'Philip Kaufman'. &uml;Right stuff&uml; results to be Philip Kaufman's one of the most successful films . He's a good filmmaker and little prolific who left some great moments in histories that not be forgotten , giving enough inspired images to make linger in the memory such as happens in &uml;Right stuff&uml; .

    Never really understood why some people are treating astronauts like real life heroes but after watching "The Right Stuff" I always get a better sense and understanding of it! This has always really been one of my favorite movies to watch and one that I'm literally always in the mood for. And this is quite an accomplishment for a movie that is well over 3 hours long! It's just simply one that never drags or starts to become uninteresting at any point, due to the incredible diversity in its story and with its many characters. I think the biggest reason why this movie works out so well is due to how it finds a perfect balance, with basically everything in it. You could really say that the movie is being very heroic and patriotic but at the same time it also shows all of the flaws of the characters and how things went very wrong at times, due to human error or even sheer stupidity at times. The movie is balanced like this with about everything! The movie is a serious one and of course based on true stories but yet it is being brought as great entertainment, with also plenty of comical situations in it. The movie is never too dramatic or heavy but also never too goofy or comical. It's a real pleasant balance that works out oh so well for this movie. It's really great how this movie is telling an important true historical story, by telling it in a mostly very entertaining way. I believe that because of this, this movie works out 10 times better and more interesting, as it would had, had it been done as a complete serious and very straightforward 3 hour+ historical epic. It also gives "The Right Stuff" so much re-playability value to it! It's truly a movie you can watch over and over again and get grabbed by it every time. It's still really a respectful movie toward the first astronauts, as well as to the test-pilots of the '40's/'50's, who pretty much were the predecessors of the first astronauts and did lots of important and dangerously groundbreaking stuff to get the first space program off the ground. It's equally paying attention to most of the first astronauts, as well as to test-pilot Chuck Yeager. It's hard to say who plays the lead role of this movie really, since there is not one main character, that it constantly follows, throughout the entire movie. It also follows the stories of the women behind the men, who of course were just as important and had to endure a lot. Basically all of the characters are really likable ones because they are portrayed like real humans, each with their own flaws and needs. It was refreshing to see real men as astronauts for a change. Men who enjoyed having a drink, the night before they had to go up into space, as opposed to all of the generic and serious scientists they are blasting off into space now days. It makes me respect the earliest astronauts all the more because they were just common men, who volunteered to do some not so very common things and constantly risked their own lives to get the job done. True pioneers of our time and also true heroes in my opinion. It's also great to see them getting played by some great and well known actors, who all suit their roles very well and also often really look like the person they are playing. It's really an all-star cast, with people such as Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, Donald Moffat and Jeff Goldblum involved but it never feels like a celebrity overkill, since everyone suits their roles so extremely well. It's such a great written and fine told movie, not only by its actors but also really by its director Philip Kaufman, who directed the movie with a lot of eye for detail. I also really loved how I really couldn't tell when the movie was using real archive footage or footage shot specifically for the movie. It adds so much realism to the movie and its overall feeling and effectiveness. Something that also deserves special attention is the wonderful musical score by Bill Conti. It also earned him an Oscar and the movie won 3 more, while it got also nominated for 4 others, including best picture. This truly is how all historical, 3 hour+ long movies, should be like! 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Unfortunately, those fifteen seconds come during the last 15 seconds of the film when there's a cheesy bit of completely unnecessary narration. The film would have benefited from written information to convey what Kaufman was trying to say. The rest of the film is a 10. In the future, I will stop this film with Yeager walking, battered and bruised in the desert. The last bit of narration is just completely out of place. It's cheesy, and it's takes away from all the successful character development of the film. If the film sets any character apart, it's Yeager. The ending contradicts those efforts, and makes the last 5 minutes of the film a bit anti-climactic. Now, for the rest of it. What an EPIC movie! It's three hours of pure entertainment. The music, the overall sound, that character development, the superb pacing of the three hours; to say this film is awesome might be an understatement. I respect James L. Brooks' "Terms of Endearment". It's his best film, but I'm not quite sure how it beat-out Kaufman's "The Right Stuff" for best picture honors for 1983. It must have been close, and that last fifteen seconds of narration in TRS might have helped. The film did win Oscars for sound and score. The way Conti's score is seamlessly woven into the film is amazing. There is a great amount of detail in the visuals and the period, and the film stands up to this day without any indication of being made in 1983. If we weren't familiar with the actors - it could have been released a month ago - and without a doubt it would have been the best film of 2011. "The Right Stuff" does for the American space race what "Das Boot" did for submariners. This film basically writes the book for this subject matter. The audience roots for nearly every character in the film. The pre-cold-war undertones are rightfully downplayed to concentrate the films' focus on those involved and their gripping heroism and humanity. The film is as much of a visual feast as it is a treat for the auditory senses. All the flight sequences show the strength of Kaufman's direction as he maintains a degree of realism and minimization that doesn't detract from the film at all. Instead of unrealistic shots of models or modern-day-CGI - we get an extremely artistic and personal take of the cockpit. It's not what's going on outside of the cockpit - it's what's going on inside. And even when Kaufman ventures outside of that cockpit - it comes off as dreamlike/out-of-this-world. In that way, the film draws more from Kubrick films like CLockwork Orange, and 2001, and sends the audience into sensory over-drive. 93/100 You'll like this if you liked: JFK, The Great Escape, Apollo 13, and The King's Speech. If you don't like this - someone needs to check your pulse. Some have criticized that the film didn't flesh-out every character. In this aspect it's a strength not a weakness. We only get to know 4 of the astronauts on the cover, and the films' better for it! There can be times when a films length can be a distraction, but this is the fastest 3 hours and fifteen minutes in Hollywood history. This is an extremely "tight" film considering the number of characters, and the years and subjects covered.

    Philip Kaufman's soaring adaptation of Tom Wolfe's biographical account of the space program, starting with Chuck Yeager's(played by Sam Shepherd) breaking the sound barrier, to the Mercury 7, the first American astronauts(played by Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Lance Henriksen, and others) to go into outer space. Film details the process of selection and training involved in preparing the astronauts for flight, as well as focusing on how they handle the media and each other. They are portrayed as real men, not cardboard cutouts, which is refreshing. A very well directed, written, and acted film is truly inspiring in how it portrays the successes and failures of these brave men, and the women in their lives. Though over three hours, it doesn't drag much, and is a most satisfying true story.

    "Is that a man?" asks the pilot of a rescue plane headed towards the crash site of Chuck Yeager's attempt to reach the edge of space in a Lockheed NF-104A. An outline of a man appears on the horizon, blurred by heat and mirage, his face bloody and burned, walking at pace with his helmet in his hand. Yeager's good friend Jack Ridley sits in the passenger seat, having seen Yeager conquer several near-suicidal flight records, including the first to break the sound barrier. Ridley smiles. "You're damn right it is!". The Right Stuff, adapted from Tom Wolfe's best-selling account of the test-pilots in the Mercury Space Program, shows what it takes to be a man; to have the 'right stuff' inhabited by these fearless men, who were the only ones crazy enough to risk everything, on live TV, to beat the Russians in the space race. Besides the many fascinating and frequently hilarious vignettes involving the test pilots - played by a stellar cast of Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Charles Frank, Lance Henriksen, Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin - the movie's real ace-in-the-hole is the juxtaposition of this story with that of Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a man thought of by his peers to be the finest pilot in the world. Played stoically by an Oscar- nominated Sam Shepard, he is brooding, dusty, a true man's man, but without the college degree needed to join the space program. He is the polar opposite of the 'hot dog's' of the Mercury Program, and when he is not off chasing his wild wife Glennis (Barbara Hershey), he is making sure he is still the fastest man in the world. Even at over 3 hours, the movie is packed with great and memorable scenes. Director Philip Kaufman managed to retain Wolfe's skill for absurd humour, so we get to see the President crawling on the floor to plug in a projector, two astronauts' slow walk to the bathroom following an enema, and a hilarious moment involving humming and sperm samples. It has an observational aesthetic that America conquered in the 1970's, made even better by some amazing aviation and space travel scenes, easily more exciting than the CGI-laden movies we get nowadays. It's often called the second-best movie of the 1980's behind Raging Bull (1980), and, although I don't necessarily agree with that statement (Blue Velvet (1986), anyone?), it's one of the finest movies to come out of it's era, feeling almost classical despite being modern. Like Shepard's Chuck Yeager, The Right Stuff seems old before its time, encompassing wisdom and poignancy with ease. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Writer/director Phil Kaufman makes the mistake of simply reading Tom Wolfe's excellent novel of the same name, and then filming this movie accordingly. This was a recipe for disaster. Wolfe talks a lot about astronaut Gordon Cooper, but in no way was Cooper the 'center' of the early western space program and Wolfe did not imply such a thing. All original seven astronauts were equally responsible for the program's success, yet Kaufman interprets Cooper's involvement as being the most important.... wrong. Cooper is mentioned near the end of the novel, so Kaufman ended his film with a red, white, and blue fanfare to present Cooper's flight as the pinnacle of everything cosmic. Apparently Kaufman did not research his subject. Good points: attention to period detail and the cameo appearance of General Chuck Yeager as a bartender.

    Director Phil Kaufmann and Producer Alan Ladd brought to the screen a movie masterpiece in The Right Stuff. Starring Sam Shephard and a roster of great actors such as Ed Harris, Charles Frank, Barbara Hershey a truly ensemble cast. Two cast members stand out the superb Kim Stanley one of the great all time actresses and Dennis Quaid who is memorable as Gordon Cooper. The ending is one of the best ever of all time. I also want to mention the thrilling score of the film. Memorable! I love this movie and as a Veteran of our Armed Forces, the greatest in the World, it is a paen to Aemrica and to the valor of the American Military!. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This Movie should have won the Academy Award, not its competitor Terms of Endearment.

    This is one of my favourite movies but it is not perfect but that has more to do with the book on which it is based. Tom Wolfe doesn't seem to be sure about whether he wants to write about breaking the sound barrier or the early days of the space program which makes it somewhat bi-polar. I tend to view it as two movies in one and can separate and appreciate both aspects. On the whole it is very well executed and certainly the desert scenes bring a realism to the early test pilot days. I am not sure about some of the acting in the astronaut sequences. I find Dennis Quaid to be especially irritating but don't know whether he is playing character to type, or over-hamming it. I thought his role could have been throttled back somewhat. I also thought the character of Lyndon Johnson was also a bit over-cooked although quite entertaining. My favourite line is when he asks Werner von Braun whether or not 'we can beat the Ruskies?' to which WVB replies 'of course, our Germans are better than their Germans'. Classic. Highly recommended and makes a good companion piece to Apollo 13 and From the Earth to the Moon.

The ending contradicts those efforts, and makes the last 5 minutes of the film a bit anti-climactic. Now, for the rest of it. What an EPIC movie! It's three hours of pure entertainment. The music, the overall sound, that character development, the superb pacing of the three hours; to say this film is awesome might be an understatement. I respect James L. Brooks' "Terms of Endearment". It's his best film, but I'm not quite sure how it beat-out Kaufman's "The Right Stuff" for best picture honors for 1983. It must have been close, and that last fifteen seconds of narration in TRS might have helped. The film did win Oscars for sound and score. The way Conti's score is seamlessly woven into the film is amazing. There is a great amount of detail in the visuals and the period, and the film stands up to this day without any indication of being made in 1983. If we weren't familiar with the actors - it could have been released a month ago - and without a doubt it would have been the best film of 2011. "The Right Stuff" does for the American space race what "Das Boot" did for submariners. This film basically writes the book for this subject matter. The audience roots for nearly every character in the film. The pre-cold-war undertones are rightfully downplayed to concentrate the films' focus on those involved and their gripping heroism and humanity. The film is as much of a visual feast as it is a treat for the auditory senses. All the flight sequences show the strength of Kaufman's direction as he maintains a degree of realism and minimization that doesn't detract from the film at all. Instead of unrealistic shots of models or modern-day-CGI - we get an extremely artistic and personal take of the cockpit. It's not what's going on outside of the cockpit - it's what's going on inside. And even when Kaufman ventures outside of that cockpit - it comes off as dreamlike/out-of-this-world. In that way, the film draws more from Kubrick films like CLockwork Orange, and 2001, and sends the audience into sensory over-drive. 93/100 You'll like this if you liked: JFK, The Great Escape, Apollo 13, and The King's Speech. If you don't like this - someone needs to check your pulse. Some have criticized that the film didn't flesh-out every character. In this aspect it's a strength not a weakness. We only get to know 4 of the astronauts on the cover, and the films' better for it! There can be times when a films length can be a distraction, but this is the fastest 3 hours and fifteen minutes in Hollywood history. This is an extremely "tight" film considering the number of characters, and the years and subjects covered.

    Philip Kaufman's soaring adaptation of Tom Wolfe's biographical account of the space program, starting with Chuck Yeager's(played by Sam Shepherd) breaking the sound barrier, to the Mercury 7, the first American astronauts(played by Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Lance Henriksen, and others) to go into outer space. Film details the process of selection and training involved in preparing the astronauts for flight, as well as focusing on how they handle the media and each other. They are portrayed as real men, not cardboard cutouts, which is refreshing. A very well directed, written, and acted film is truly inspiring in how it portrays the successes and failures of these brave men, and the women in their lives. Though over three hours, it doesn't drag much, and is a most satisfying true story.

    "Is that a man?" asks the pilot of a rescue plane headed towards the crash site of Chuck Yeager's attempt to reach the edge of space in a Lockheed NF-104A. An outline of a man appears on the horizon, blurred by heat and mirage, his face bloody and burned, walking at pace with his helmet in his hand. Yeager's good friend Jack Ridley sits in the passenger seat, having seen Yeager conquer several near-suicidal flight records, including the first to break the sound barrier. Ridley smiles. "You're damn right it is!". The Right Stuff, adapted from Tom Wolfe's best-selling account of the test-pilots in the Mercury Space Program, shows what it takes to be a man; to have the 'right stuff' inhabited by these fearless men, who were the only ones crazy enough to risk everything, on live TV, to beat the Russians in the space race. Besides the many fascinating and frequently hilarious vignettes involving the test pilots - played by a stellar cast of Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Charles Frank, Lance Henriksen, Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin - the movie's real ace-in-the-hole is the juxtaposition of this story with that of Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a man thought of by his peers to be the finest pilot in the world. Played stoically by an Oscar- nominated Sam Shepard, he is brooding, dusty, a true man's man, but without the college degree needed to join the space program. He is the polar opposite of the 'hot dog's' of the Mercury Program, and when he is not off chasing his wild wife Glennis (Barbara Hershey), he is making sure he is still the fastest man in the world. Even at over 3 hours, the movie is packed with great and memorable scenes. Director Philip Kaufman managed to retain Wolfe's skill for absurd humour, so we get to see the President crawling on the floor to plug in a projector, two astronauts' slow walk to the bathroom following an enema, and a hilarious moment involving humming and sperm samples. It has an observational aesthetic that America conquered in the 1970's, made even better by some amazing aviation and space travel scenes, easily more exciting than the CGI-laden movies we get nowadays. It's often called the second-best movie of the 1980's behind Raging Bull (1980), and, although I don't necessarily agree with that statement (Blue Velvet (1986), anyone?), it's one of the finest movies to come out of it's era, feeling almost classical despite being modern. Like Shepard's Chuck Yeager, The Right Stuff seems old before its time, encompassing wisdom and poignancy with ease. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Writer/director Phil Kaufman makes the mistake of simply reading Tom Wolfe's excellent novel of the same name, and then filming this movie accordingly. This was a recipe for disaster. Wolfe talks a lot about astronaut Gordon Cooper, but in no way was Cooper the 'center' of the early western space program and Wolfe did not imply such a thing. All original seven astronauts were equally responsible for the program's success, yet Kaufman interprets Cooper's involvement as being the most important.... wrong. Cooper is mentioned near the end of the novel, so Kaufman ended his film with a red, white, and blue fanfare to present Cooper's flight as the pinnacle of everything cosmic. Apparently Kaufman did not research his subject. Good points: attention to period detail and the cameo appearance of General Chuck Yeager as a bartender.

    Director Phil Kaufmann and Producer Alan Ladd brought to the screen a movie masterpiece in The Right Stuff. Starring Sam Shephard and a roster of great actors such as Ed Harris, Charles Frank, Barbara Hershey a truly ensemble cast. Two cast members stand out the superb Kim Stanley one of the great all time actresses and Dennis Quaid who is memorable as Gordon Cooper. The ending is one of the best ever of all time. I also want to mention the thrilling score of the film. Memorable! I love this movie and as a Veteran of our Armed Forces, the greatest in the World, it is a paen to Aemrica and to the valor of the American Military!. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This Movie should have won the Academy Award, not its competitor Terms of Endearment.

    This is one of my favourite movies but it is not perfect but that has more to do with the book on which it is based. Tom Wolfe doesn't seem to be sure about whether he wants to write about breaking the sound barrier or the early days of the space program which makes it somewhat bi-polar. I tend to view it as two movies in one and can separate and appreciate both aspects. On the whole it is very well executed and certainly the desert scenes bring a realism to the early test pilot days. I am not sure about some of the acting in the astronaut sequences. I find Dennis Quaid to be especially irritating but don't know whether he is playing character to type, or over-hamming it. I thought his role could have been throttled back somewhat. I also thought the character of Lyndon Johnson was also a bit over-cooked although quite entertaining. My favourite line is when he asks Werner von Braun whether or not 'we can beat the Ruskies?' to which WVB replies 'of course, our Germans are better than their Germans'. Classic. Highly recommended and makes a good companion piece to Apollo 13 and From the Earth to the Moon.

    I caught this movie on one of the movie channels again the other night, and realized how much I love this movie. I am a flight/space buff so of course it appeals to me. But aside from that, the acting, special effects, story line, everything is good to the point of making it a good film. It has just the right mix of seriousness and comic relief to make it enjoyable to watch and entertaining as well. The movie shows how pitifully far behind the Russians we were in the space race, yet we somehow managed to catch up. The one issue I have with the movie is how it portrays Gus Grissom being at fault for blowing the hatch to his capsule, while in actuality NASA concluded that he was correct. The astronauts had to punch a large switch with the side of their closed fist to blow the hatch, leaving tell-tale bruising on their hands. Grissom never had any bruising on his hand so could not have blown the hatch himself. However, this is one of those movies which I've seen several times, but every time it comes on again I'll want to sit and watch the whole thing.

    I am a movie fanatic and this movie is one of my all time favorites. I loved how this movie had several themes going on: The best pilot did not have a college degree so he could not be considered for the project. (Yeager) All the tests they gave without having any idea which were really needed since no one had been in space before. There were some very funny scenes and suspense and emotions. One of my favorite scenes was when they all had a big bar-b-que celebration and with all the activities going on, each one of the team looks at each other and communicate without saying a word. I have seen this move at least 20 times and could watch it again tonight and enjoy it once more.

    This story broadly painted deals with the beginnings of the US space career and the first seven Mercury astronauts , being based on Tom Wolf's nonfiction novel . The space began when Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard who played legendary pilot , is actually afraid of flying) broke the sound barrier and scorching Mach 2 and following to other aviation pioneers , the Mercury mission with 7 astronauts , the suicide squadron who volunteer for astronaut training is formed by a motley cast (Fred Ward , Dennis Quaid , Lance Henriksen , Ed Harris , Scott Glenn and Scott Paulin) , showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select volunteers to be in it. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to surpass at their trail of glory in the sky . Electrifying film with credible interpretations but overlong and oddly uninvolving , based on Tom Wolfe's ambitious book about the history of the U.S. Space program , it reads like a novel . However , Tom Wolfe, was unhappy with the film because he felt it made too many changes to the book. William Goldman, the original screenwriter before he left the project also disliked it because he didn't like the way Philip Kaufman portrayed Chuck Yeager as the only hero in the film, while the rest of the astronauts only got lucky and didn't match up to him in any way. The film has that same fictional quality ; furthermore is thrilling , imaginative , rowdy and overlong -at more than three hours , including unnecessary material - all at once . The picture attempts hardly to tell the tale of human beings as well as the space conquest . The movie tries to narrate parallel stories , though it never quite successfully integrate them . It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager -Sam Shepard- as a test pilot of the old breed , giving a nice and charming performance . It provides an all-star-cast who bolster a fine movie with special mention to Ed Harris playing John Glen who subsequently was running for President . The main cast is perfectly completed by known secondaries as Barbara Hershey , Pamela Reed , Veronica Cartwright , Kathy Baker , David Clennon , Scott Wilson , Jeff Goldblum , Royal Dano , Donald Moffat among others . Special effects work and production design by Geoffrey Kirkland is spectacular and could hardly be bettered ; however , some moments relies heavily from stock-shots . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Caleb Deschanel , the role of Annie Glenn was the first film role for his wife , Mary Jo Deschanel . Imaginative and evocative musical score composed and conducted by Bill Conti . The film's music temp track consisted of music from Holst's The Planets, Henry Mancini's score for The White Dawn and various other classical pieces which were favorites of Director 'Philip Kaufman'. &uml;Right stuff&uml; results to be Philip Kaufman's one of the most successful films . He's a good filmmaker and little prolific who left some great moments in histories that not be forgotten , giving enough inspired images to make linger in the memory such as happens in &uml;Right stuff&uml; . Kaufman realized a Western &uml;Great Northfield Minnessota Raid&uml;, a youthful tale as &uml;The Wanderers&uml;, Sci-Fi &uml; as &uml;Invasion body snatchers&uml;and two sexual stories &uml;Unbearable lightness of being&uml; and &uml;Henry and June&uml;.

    Never really understood why some people are treating astronauts like real life heroes but after watching "The Right Stuff" I always get a better sense and understanding of it! This has always really been one of my favorite movies to watch and one that I'm literally always in the mood for. And this is quite an accomplishment for a movie that is well over 3 hours long! It's just simply one that never drags or starts to become uninteresting at any point, due to the incredible diversity in its story and with its many characters. I think the biggest reason why this movie works out so well is due to how it finds a perfect balance, with basically everything in it. You could really say that the movie is being very heroic and patriotic but at the same time it also shows all of the flaws of the characters and how things went very wrong at times, due to human error or even sheer stupidity at times. The movie is balanced like this with about everything! The movie is a serious one and of course based on true stories but yet it is being brought as great entertainment, with also plenty of comical situations in it. The movie is never too dramatic or heavy but also never too goofy or comical. It's a real pleasant balance that works out oh so well for this movie. It's really great how this movie is telling an important true historical story, by telling it in a mostly very entertaining way. I believe that because of this, this movie works out 10 times better and more interesting, as it would had, had it been done as a complete serious and very straightforward 3 hour+ historical epic. It also gives "The Right Stuff" so much re-playability value to it! It's truly a movie you can watch over and over again and get grabbed by it every time. It's still really a respectful movie toward the first astronauts, as well as to the test-pilots of the '40's/'50's, who pretty much were the predecessors of the first astronauts and did lots of important and dangerously groundbreaking stuff to get the first space program off the ground. It's equally paying attention to most of the first astronauts, as well as to test-pilot Chuck Yeager. It's hard to say who plays the lead role of this movie really, since there is not one main character, that it constantly follows, throughout the entire movie. It also follows the stories of the women behind the men, who of course were just as important and had to endure a lot. Basically all of the characters are really likable ones because they are portrayed like real humans, each with their own flaws and needs. It was refreshing to see real men as astronauts for a change. Men who enjoyed having a drink, the night before they had to go up into space, as opposed to all of the generic and serious scientists they are blasting off into space now days. It makes me respect the earliest astronauts all the more because they were just common men, who volunteered to do some not so very common things and constantly risked their own lives to get the job done. True pioneers of our time and also true heroes in my opinion. It's also great to see them getting played by some great and well known actors, who all suit their roles very well and also often really look like the person they are playing. It's really an all-star cast, with people such as Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, Donald Moffat and Jeff Goldblum involved but it never feels like a celebrity overkill, since everyone suits their roles so extremely well. It's such a great written and fine told movie, not only by its actors but also really by its director Philip Kaufman, who directed the movie with a lot of eye for detail. I also really loved how I really couldn't tell when the movie was using real archive footage or footage shot specifically for the movie. It adds so much realism to the movie and its overall feeling and effectiveness. Something that also deserves special attention is the wonderful musical score by Bill Conti. It also earned him an Oscar and the movie won 3 more, while it got also nominated for 4 others, including best picture. This truly is how all historical, 3 hour+ long movies, should be like! 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Unfortunately, those fifteen seconds come during the last 15 seconds of the film when there's a cheesy bit of completely unnecessary narration. The film would have benefited from written information to convey what Kaufman was trying to say. The rest of the film is a 10. In the future, I will stop this film with Yeager walking, battered and bruised in the desert. The last bit of narration is just completely out of place. It's cheesy, and it's takes away from all the successful character development of the film. If the film sets any character apart, it's Yeager.
