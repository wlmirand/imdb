    Questionable Disney film with Hayley Mills playing 2 roles; twins whose existence was kept from the other due to an improbable and cold-hearted decision by their selfish, divorced parents played by a lovely Maureen O'Hara and a tubby Brian Keith who's notably lacking in warmth. Mills doesn't make the twins distinctive though the special effects are fine and unobtrusive. The big problem with the film is that the adults are childish and unappealing and Keith and O' Hara don't belong together and what brought them together in the first place remains a mystery. Pity Joanna Barnes who was so good in Auntie Mame (1958), she has a thankless role and has been prematurely aged by hairstyle, make-up and photography. The supporting cast made up of familiar faces is dull and David Swift's direction of this big screen sitcom is anything but swift.

    After watching the 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan, I had to check out the 60's version which I thought was unbelievably filmed well! Firstly, before I start ranting on how great the film was, I will say that I don't think that this film doesn't match the remake. Usually I find remade films worse or less superior than the originals but for some reason I just found some more fun in the remake. The original however I think is still excellent and should still be viewed. The plot centers on two twins who discover each other at a girls camp. They find out who each other's parents are and then they decide to con-cock a mischievous plan into swapping places and getting to know each other's parents before meeting again, trying to reunite their parents. The acting, scenery and settings, music score, unique moments and memorable scenes were put together very well and the entire film still holds up to today's standards. My first thoughts were that the film wasn't going to be great at all and that it wasn't going to beat the remake. I was wrong about it being a well made masterpiece, but I was right about it not beating the remake in my opinion. I thought everything was a little different and more absurd whilst I still found more moments (especially the woods scenes). However, I did find the music a little bit too typical (very 50's-60's styled themed music, it sounded like anything else). Overall, I do love this film. I don't have anything negative to say about it, but there's just something about the remake which I found more special, but then again if we didn't have this film, we wouldn't have the remake!!! Anyway, I really believe the film is one of the best 1960's films, ranking right up with 60's horror such as Black Sabbath and Rosemary's Baby. 8.5/10

    No doubt as a penance for releasing scores of animated films without cogent family units, Disney released The Parent Trap; a Hayley Mills starring, anti-divorce film that had to have felt dated on arrival. In it, a set of estranged identical twins meet by sheer happenstance at camp, trade places, and attempt to bring their divorced parents back together again. The plot immediately appealed to me, even though I had seen the Lindsay Lohan remake. It's a story about the difficulties of preserving the family unit, the unfairness of divorce on young children and the implications of love when faced with the practicalities of life. So naturally Disney sidesteps such themes to make a film as fluffy and unnecessary as a feather boa. Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating a little. The young Hayley Mills who had just started her Disney movie blitz is at her best as the likable twins Susan and Sharon. Both characters have personalities that are just developed enough to tell them apart but in case its too subtle one has a bad case of Long Island lockjaw. Their hijinks are fun, their humor agreeable and the end result is one of the more charming performances to come from a child actor. I'm actually quite concerned for these kids who have to deal with such narcissistic parents. Sure Disney glosses over the reasons why they got divorced in the first place but its easy to see their personalities are just too self-absorbed to be loving partners...or parents. If you're the proud parents of twins or triplets or sextuplets, you'd be able to narrow in on who's Justin and Dustin wouldn't you? That puzzle would be even less difficult if one of them had been a stranger to you for thirteen or so years but this all seems to be above their heads. Its only when one of the twins finally blurts out the truth that the families discover there's something rotten in the state of Massachusetts. The parents get even worse when they reunite and start exchanging rancorous chit-chat. The father (Brian Keith) you see is about to marry a much younger gold digger who, of course, exemplifies the evil stepmother trope we've all come to expect. So it only makes sense that the man's ex-wife (Maureen O'Hara) takes a trip to the coast, unannounced, totting one of two Machiavellian moppets, making catty comments, and dressing in the man's bathrobe. She then prances around the grounds while he's entertaining in a twisted game of hide-and-seek. Once they actually meet up, they of course argue until she literally punches him in the face in front of their kids! By that point, the couple was one mimosa away from "Thunderdome". If either of them were smart they'd get a restraining order against each other and shuttle both kids back and forth between California and Massachusetts. Not an idyllic solution, but its better than living with "The War of the Roses" (1988) 24/7. But alas they do stick it out together in the end because everything is supposed to be cheery, rosy and bright. It's a Disney movie after all; there are no tears in Disney movies! I just fear that kids with divorced parents will see this movie and want to imitate it which is kind of sad when you think about it. Its a hard lesson to learn kids, but sometimes a divorced household is better than one where one parent's in the morgue and the other in jail.

    I first saw this movie on Sunday night TV Wonderful World of Disney in 1979 and was hooked. I bought the book at the school book fair and reread it a dozen times. My older sister had seen Parent Trap in the theater and knew all of the parts that 1970s TV had edited out. In the 1980s I finally got to see the whole film uncut on the Disney cable channel and finally got to figure out "the little dolls signing the parent trap song" my sister spoke of (there was 15 minutes I'd never get back).... Dorky animated cupids aside, as a kid I loved the movie's cross country saga. The camp cabin sabotage, the twins joining forces to prank dad's girlfriend. Although most kids will still enjoy the original movie's favorite kid moments of the punchbowl splashing into a chaperon, the timeless cake falling on Miss Inch's face, and Vicky's hissy fit, the movie's long pace might bore todays kids. Although some purists don't like the new remake of Parent Trap, I thought the remake kept the essence of the original story and updated it to match todays global travel, destigmatization of divorce, etc.

    Girls who look exactly like each other meet at a camp and take a ridiculously long time to figure out that they are twins. This silly comedy has some amusing moments but rambles on far too long, often becoming a drag. The whole premise of each parent taking a twin after divorce with no intention of ever meeting again seems preposterous. It is never explained why the twins speak with a British accent when they were born and brought up in the US. Did the filmmakers think that accent is genetic and was inherited from Irish (close enough to British) mom O'Hara? It is more likely that Mills was incapable of sporting an American accent.

    The other reviewers have already well defined the out-of-time charm of this nice Disney production. Most important to me is the fact that it stays a light movie with good characterization and fine dialogue. However, at over two hours this is way too long for a comedy. The prologue at the camp where the girls meet sets the pedestrian (family?) rhythm. Then, there are very few twists and turns but each are stretched for long sequences. Had the movie been any less good on other accounts - cast & characters, dialogue, settings and production values at large - it would surely look tedious.

    Pretty short-haired Hayley Mills (as Susan Evers) and pretty long-haired Hayley Mills (as Sharon McKendrick) meet at camp and discover they are twins who were separated at birth by divorcing parents Brian Keith (as Mitch) and Maureen O'Hara (as Maggie). At first, the thirteen-year-old girls don't get along, but they soon become fast friends. It doesn't take too much thinking to figure out the plot from here. The twins decide to switch places and bring their parents back together, since neither remarried. But, they must first stop Mr. Keith from marrying gold-digger Joanna Barnes (as Vicky Robinson)... After looking at Maureen O'Hara, I'd consider marrying her. After looking at Mr. Keith's California estate, I'd consider marrying him, too. So, I guess these parents stayed single because, at Ms. Mills deduces, they really do love each other. They sure fight like an old married couple. Why they separated their daughters, and hid them from each other, is inexplicable. While it's never revealed, the daughters must have spent many years in British finishing schools, without running into each other. The "split-screen" is very good, but Mr. Keith's hairpiece does not match properly. Okay, I'm marrying Hayley Mills. ***** The Parent Trap (6/12/61) David Swift ~ Hayley Mills, Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara, Joanna Barnes

    When people watch The Parent Trap, I wonder if they ever notice, like I have, a certain undercurrent of cruelty that even got past Walt Disney's watchful eye. If you didn't catch it, let me point it out: Mitch and Maggie Evers get divorced and decide to let an entire continent separate them. This is realistic so far. But their breakup is obviously so hostile and nasty that one takes Sharon, the other takes Susan, and mutually decide that neither twin shall ever know of their other sibling's existence. This is bad enough on its own. But to add icing to this inedible cake, Mitch and Maggie choose to forget about their other child at the other end of the country. Why inflict this on their girls? They didn't ask to be born, let alone cause the split. Okay, okay, I tend to look a little too close at this stuff today than when I was younger. After all, that is the plot, right? And the twins resolve this parental problem, right? And Disney would never end any movie on a sad note, right? Despite my observation, I enjoyed the rest of the movie. So go pop some popcorn and enjoy.

    one of Disney's all time favourite classics and beloved by many of all different ages. Hayley mills who quickly rose to stardom and recognition for her superb choice of roles shined in this family dramedy after twin sisters separated at birth after their parents divorce who took one girl each at birth. they would meet years later as teens at a summer camp not knowing the other existed. what ensues is hilarity at every corner and classic slapstick and physical comedy. mills is the perfect choice for the role as if she were born to play it and the added touch is her fun song performance mid-way through the film. i thought the film was perfectly cast and there was just great chemistry between all the actors. it's also nice to see that Maggie was portrayed as a fiercely independent and fiery individual who didn't take nonsense from anyone and stood up for herself. the script was expertly written without the story being overly sappy or melodramatic. plus there weren't any points where it dragged for too long or bored the audience. i didn't much care for the sequels that followed which also starred Hayley mills but as and adult. i recently saw the remake starring Lindsay lohan and it doesn't do it justice. you can't beat the original as it's always the first one you see.

    Hayley Mills here was just in the right place at the right time and in the right role. It turned out to be one of the finest screen performances by a child actor. That this was comedy made Mills' work all the more impressive, for this is a difficult, underrated genre in which to excel. Her every line, gesture and expression was perfect. It was Hayley's greatest work, and a triumph for the Disney Studios. The rest of the cast from Maureen O'Hara (at her most beautiful) to Brian Keith (at his most charming) was ideal. Ditto for the entire supporting cast. A truly wonderful comedy.

Hayley mills who quickly rose to stardom and recognition for her superb choice of roles shined in this family dramedy after twin sisters separated at birth after their parents divorce who took one girl each at birth. they would meet years later as teens at a summer camp not knowing the other existed. what ensues is hilarity at every corner and classic slapstick and physical comedy. mills is the perfect choice for the role as if she were born to play it and the added touch is her fun song performance mid-way through the film. i thought the film was perfectly cast and there was just great chemistry between all the actors. it's also nice to see that Maggie was portrayed as a fiercely independent and fiery individual who didn't take nonsense from anyone and stood up for herself. the script was expertly written without the story being overly sappy or melodramatic. plus there weren't any points where it dragged for too long or bored the audience. i didn't much care for the sequels that followed which also starred Hayley mills but as and adult. i recently saw the remake starring Lindsay lohan and it doesn't do it justice. you can't beat the original as it's always the first one you see.

    Hayley Mills here was just in the right place at the right time and in the right role. It turned out to be one of the finest screen performances by a child actor. That this was comedy made Mills' work all the more impressive, for this is a difficult, underrated genre in which to excel. Her every line, gesture and expression was perfect. It was Hayley's greatest work, and a triumph for the Disney Studios. The rest of the cast from Maureen O'Hara (at her most beautiful) to Brian Keith (at his most charming) was ideal. Ditto for the entire supporting cast. A truly wonderful comedy.

    Questionable Disney film with Hayley Mills playing 2 roles; twins whose existence was kept from the other due to an improbable and cold-hearted decision by their selfish, divorced parents played by a lovely Maureen O'Hara and a tubby Brian Keith who's notably lacking in warmth. Mills doesn't make the twins distinctive though the special effects are fine and unobtrusive. The big problem with the film is that the adults are childish and unappealing and Keith and O' Hara don't belong together and what brought them together in the first place remains a mystery. Pity Joanna Barnes who was so good in Auntie Mame (1958), she has a thankless role and has been prematurely aged by hairstyle, make-up and photography. The supporting cast made up of familiar faces is dull and David Swift's direction of this big screen sitcom is anything but swift.

    After watching the 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan, I had to check out the 60's version which I thought was unbelievably filmed well! Firstly, before I start ranting on how great the film was, I will say that I don't think that this film doesn't match the remake. Usually I find remade films worse or less superior than the originals but for some reason I just found some more fun in the remake. The original however I think is still excellent and should still be viewed. The plot centers on two twins who discover each other at a girls camp. They find out who each other's parents are and then they decide to con-cock a mischievous plan into swapping places and getting to know each other's parents before meeting again, trying to reunite their parents. The acting, scenery and settings, music score, unique moments and memorable scenes were put together very well and the entire film still holds up to today's standards. My first thoughts were that the film wasn't going to be great at all and that it wasn't going to beat the remake. I was wrong about it being a well made masterpiece, but I was right about it not beating the remake in my opinion. I thought everything was a little different and more absurd whilst I still found more moments (especially the woods scenes). However, I did find the music a little bit too typical (very 50's-60's styled themed music, it sounded like anything else). Overall, I do love this film. I don't have anything negative to say about it, but there's just something about the remake which I found more special, but then again if we didn't have this film, we wouldn't have the remake!!! Anyway, I really believe the film is one of the best 1960's films, ranking right up with 60's horror such as Black Sabbath and Rosemary's Baby. 8.5/10

    No doubt as a penance for releasing scores of animated films without cogent family units, Disney released The Parent Trap; a Hayley Mills starring, anti-divorce film that had to have felt dated on arrival. In it, a set of estranged identical twins meet by sheer happenstance at camp, trade places, and attempt to bring their divorced parents back together again. The plot immediately appealed to me, even though I had seen the Lindsay Lohan remake. It's a story about the difficulties of preserving the family unit, the unfairness of divorce on young children and the implications of love when faced with the practicalities of life. So naturally Disney sidesteps such themes to make a film as fluffy and unnecessary as a feather boa. Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating a little. The young Hayley Mills who had just started her Disney movie blitz is at her best as the likable twins Susan and Sharon. Both characters have personalities that are just developed enough to tell them apart but in case its too subtle one has a bad case of Long Island lockjaw. Their hijinks are fun, their humor agreeable and the end result is one of the more charming performances to come from a child actor. I'm actually quite concerned for these kids who have to deal with such narcissistic parents. Sure Disney glosses over the reasons why they got divorced in the first place but its easy to see their personalities are just too self-absorbed to be loving partners...or parents. If you're the proud parents of twins or triplets or sextuplets, you'd be able to narrow in on who's Justin and Dustin wouldn't you? That puzzle would be even less difficult if one of them had been a stranger to you for thirteen or so years but this all seems to be above their heads. Its only when one of the twins finally blurts out the truth that the families discover there's something rotten in the state of Massachusetts. The parents get even worse when they reunite and start exchanging rancorous chit-chat. The father (Brian Keith) you see is about to marry a much younger gold digger who, of course, exemplifies the evil stepmother trope we've all come to expect. So it only makes sense that the man's ex-wife (Maureen O'Hara) takes a trip to the coast, unannounced, totting one of two Machiavellian moppets, making catty comments, and dressing in the man's bathrobe. She then prances around the grounds while he's entertaining in a twisted game of hide-and-seek. Once they actually meet up, they of course argue until she literally punches him in the face in front of their kids! By that point, the couple was one mimosa away from "Thunderdome". If either of them were smart they'd get a restraining order against each other and shuttle both kids back and forth between California and Massachusetts. Not an idyllic solution, but its better than living with "The War of the Roses" (1988) 24/7. But alas they do stick it out together in the end because everything is supposed to be cheery, rosy and bright. It's a Disney movie after all; there are no tears in Disney movies! I just fear that kids with divorced parents will see this movie and want to imitate it which is kind of sad when you think about it. Its a hard lesson to learn kids, but sometimes a divorced household is better than one where one parent's in the morgue and the other in jail.

    I first saw this movie on Sunday night TV Wonderful World of Disney in 1979 and was hooked. I bought the book at the school book fair and reread it a dozen times. My older sister had seen Parent Trap in the theater and knew all of the parts that 1970s TV had edited out. In the 1980s I finally got to see the whole film uncut on the Disney cable channel and finally got to figure out "the little dolls signing the parent trap song" my sister spoke of (there was 15 minutes I'd never get back).... Dorky animated cupids aside, as a kid I loved the movie's cross country saga. The camp cabin sabotage, the twins joining forces to prank dad's girlfriend. Although most kids will still enjoy the original movie's favorite kid moments of the punchbowl splashing into a chaperon, the timeless cake falling on Miss Inch's face, and Vicky's hissy fit, the movie's long pace might bore todays kids. Although some purists don't like the new remake of Parent Trap, I thought the remake kept the essence of the original story and updated it to match todays global travel, destigmatization of divorce, etc.

    Girls who look exactly like each other meet at a camp and take a ridiculously long time to figure out that they are twins. This silly comedy has some amusing moments but rambles on far too long, often becoming a drag. The whole premise of each parent taking a twin after divorce with no intention of ever meeting again seems preposterous. It is never explained why the twins speak with a British accent when they were born and brought up in the US. Did the filmmakers think that accent is genetic and was inherited from Irish (close enough to British) mom O'Hara? It is more likely that Mills was incapable of sporting an American accent.

    The other reviewers have already well defined the out-of-time charm of this nice Disney production. Most important to me is the fact that it stays a light movie with good characterization and fine dialogue. However, at over two hours this is way too long for a comedy. The prologue at the camp where the girls meet sets the pedestrian (family?) rhythm. Then, there are very few twists and turns but each are stretched for long sequences. Had the movie been any less good on other accounts - cast & characters, dialogue, settings and production values at large - it would surely look tedious.

    Pretty short-haired Hayley Mills (as Susan Evers) and pretty long-haired Hayley Mills (as Sharon McKendrick) meet at camp and discover they are twins who were separated at birth by divorcing parents Brian Keith (as Mitch) and Maureen O'Hara (as Maggie). At first, the thirteen-year-old girls don't get along, but they soon become fast friends. It doesn't take too much thinking to figure out the plot from here. The twins decide to switch places and bring their parents back together, since neither remarried. But, they must first stop Mr. Keith from marrying gold-digger Joanna Barnes (as Vicky Robinson)... After looking at Maureen O'Hara, I'd consider marrying her. After looking at Mr. Keith's California estate, I'd consider marrying him, too. So, I guess these parents stayed single because, at Ms. Mills deduces, they really do love each other. They sure fight like an old married couple. Why they separated their daughters, and hid them from each other, is inexplicable. While it's never revealed, the daughters must have spent many years in British finishing schools, without running into each other. The "split-screen" is very good, but Mr. Keith's hairpiece does not match properly. Okay, I'm marrying Hayley Mills. ***** The Parent Trap (6/12/61) David Swift ~ Hayley Mills, Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara, Joanna Barnes

    When people watch The Parent Trap, I wonder if they ever notice, like I have, a certain undercurrent of cruelty that even got past Walt Disney's watchful eye. If you didn't catch it, let me point it out: Mitch and Maggie Evers get divorced and decide to let an entire continent separate them. This is realistic so far. But their breakup is obviously so hostile and nasty that one takes Sharon, the other takes Susan, and mutually decide that neither twin shall ever know of their other sibling's existence. This is bad enough on its own. But to add icing to this inedible cake, Mitch and Maggie choose to forget about their other child at the other end of the country. Why inflict this on their girls? They didn't ask to be born, let alone cause the split. Okay, okay, I tend to look a little too close at this stuff today than when I was younger. After all, that is the plot, right? And the twins resolve this parental problem, right? And Disney would never end any movie on a sad note, right? Despite my observation, I enjoyed the rest of the movie. So go pop some popcorn and enjoy.

Hayley mills who quickly rose to stardom and recognition for her superb choice of roles shined in this family dramedy after twin sisters separated at birth after their parents divorce who took one girl each at birth. they would meet years later as teens at a summer camp not knowing the other existed. what ensues is hilarity at every corner and classic slapstick and physical comedy. mills is the perfect choice for the role as if she were born to play it and the added touch is her fun song performance mid-way through the film. i thought the film was perfectly cast and there was just great chemistry between all the actors. it's also nice to see that Maggie was portrayed as a fiercely independent and fiery individual who didn't take nonsense from anyone and stood up for herself. the script was expertly written without the story being overly sappy or melodramatic. plus there weren't any points where it dragged for too long or bored the audience. i didn't much care for the sequels that followed which also starred Hayley mills but as and adult. i recently saw the remake starring Lindsay lohan and it doesn't do it justice. you can't beat the original as it's always the first one you see.

    Hayley Mills here was just in the right place at the right time and in the right role. It turned out to be one of the finest screen performances by a child actor. That this was comedy made Mills' work all the more impressive, for this is a difficult, underrated genre in which to excel. Her every line, gesture and expression was perfect. It was Hayley's greatest work, and a triumph for the Disney Studios. The rest of the cast from Maureen O'Hara (at her most beautiful) to Brian Keith (at his most charming) was ideal. Ditto for the entire supporting cast. A truly wonderful comedy.

    Questionable Disney film with Hayley Mills playing 2 roles; twins whose existence was kept from the other due to an improbable and cold-hearted decision by their selfish, divorced parents played by a lovely Maureen O'Hara and a tubby Brian Keith who's notably lacking in warmth. Mills doesn't make the twins distinctive though the special effects are fine and unobtrusive. The big problem with the film is that the adults are childish and unappealing and Keith and O' Hara don't belong together and what brought them together in the first place remains a mystery. Pity Joanna Barnes who was so good in Auntie Mame (1958), she has a thankless role and has been prematurely aged by hairstyle, make-up and photography. The supporting cast made up of familiar faces is dull and David Swift's direction of this big screen sitcom is anything but swift.

    After watching the 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan, I had to check out the 60's version which I thought was unbelievably filmed well! Firstly, before I start ranting on how great the film was, I will say that I don't think that this film doesn't match the remake. Usually I find remade films worse or less superior than the originals but for some reason I just found some more fun in the remake. The original however I think is still excellent and should still be viewed. The plot centers on two twins who discover each other at a girls camp. They find out who each other's parents are and then they decide to con-cock a mischievous plan into swapping places and getting to know each other's parents before meeting again, trying to reunite their parents. The acting, scenery and settings, music score, unique moments and memorable scenes were put together very well and the entire film still holds up to today's standards. My first thoughts were that the film wasn't going to be great at all and that it wasn't going to beat the remake. I was wrong about it being a well made masterpiece, but I was right about it not beating the remake in my opinion. I thought everything was a little different and more absurd whilst I still found more moments (especially the woods scenes). However, I did find the music a little bit too typical (very 50's-60's styled themed music, it sounded like anything else). Overall, I do love this film. I don't have anything negative to say about it, but there's just something about the remake which I found more special, but then again if we didn't have this film, we wouldn't have the remake!!! Anyway, I really believe the film is one of the best 1960's films, ranking right up with 60's horror such as Black Sabbath and Rosemary's Baby. 8.5/10

    No doubt as a penance for releasing scores of animated films without cogent family units, Disney released The Parent Trap; a Hayley Mills starring, anti-divorce film that had to have felt dated on arrival. In it, a set of estranged identical twins meet by sheer happenstance at camp, trade places, and attempt to bring their divorced parents back together again. The plot immediately appealed to me, even though I had seen the Lindsay Lohan remake. It's a story about the difficulties of preserving the family unit, the unfairness of divorce on young children and the implications of love when faced with the practicalities of life. So naturally Disney sidesteps such themes to make a film as fluffy and unnecessary as a feather boa. Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating a little. The young Hayley Mills who had just started her Disney movie blitz is at her best as the likable twins Susan and Sharon. Both characters have personalities that are just developed enough to tell them apart but in case its too subtle one has a bad case of Long Island lockjaw. Their hijinks are fun, their humor agreeable and the end result is one of the more charming performances to come from a child actor. I'm actually quite concerned for these kids who have to deal with such narcissistic parents. Sure Disney glosses over the reasons why they got divorced in the first place but its easy to see their personalities are just too self-absorbed to be loving partners...or parents. If you're the proud parents of twins or triplets or sextuplets, you'd be able to narrow in on who's Justin and Dustin wouldn't you? That puzzle would be even less difficult if one of them had been a stranger to you for thirteen or so years but this all seems to be above their heads. Its only when one of the twins finally blurts out the truth that the families discover there's something rotten in the state of Massachusetts. The parents get even worse when they reunite and start exchanging rancorous chit-chat. The father (Brian Keith) you see is about to marry a much younger gold digger who, of course, exemplifies the evil stepmother trope we've all come to expect. So it only makes sense that the man's ex-wife (Maureen O'Hara) takes a trip to the coast, unannounced, totting one of two Machiavellian moppets, making catty comments, and dressing in the man's bathrobe. She then prances around the grounds while he's entertaining in a twisted game of hide-and-seek. Once they actually meet up, they of course argue until she literally punches him in the face in front of their kids! By that point, the couple was one mimosa away from "Thunderdome". If either of them were smart they'd get a restraining order against each other and shuttle both kids back and forth between California and Massachusetts. Not an idyllic solution, but its better than living with "The War of the Roses" (1988) 24/7. But alas they do stick it out together in the end because everything is supposed to be cheery, rosy and bright. It's a Disney movie after all; there are no tears in Disney movies! I just fear that kids with divorced parents will see this movie and want to imitate it which is kind of sad when you think about it. Its a hard lesson to learn kids, but sometimes a divorced household is better than one where one parent's in the morgue and the other in jail.

    I first saw this movie on Sunday night TV Wonderful World of Disney in 1979 and was hooked. I bought the book at the school book fair and reread it a dozen times. My older sister had seen Parent Trap in the theater and knew all of the parts that 1970s TV had edited out. In the 1980s I finally got to see the whole film uncut on the Disney cable channel and finally got to figure out "the little dolls signing the parent trap song" my sister spoke of (there was 15 minutes I'd never get back).... Dorky animated cupids aside, as a kid I loved the movie's cross country saga. The camp cabin sabotage, the twins joining forces to prank dad's girlfriend. Although most kids will still enjoy the original movie's favorite kid moments of the punchbowl splashing into a chaperon, the timeless cake falling on Miss Inch's face, and Vicky's hissy fit, the movie's long pace might bore todays kids. Although some purists don't like the new remake of Parent Trap, I thought the remake kept the essence of the original story and updated it to match todays global travel, destigmatization of divorce, etc.

    Girls who look exactly like each other meet at a camp and take a ridiculously long time to figure out that they are twins. This silly comedy has some amusing moments but rambles on far too long, often becoming a drag. The whole premise of each parent taking a twin after divorce with no intention of ever meeting again seems preposterous. It is never explained why the twins speak with a British accent when they were born and brought up in the US. Did the filmmakers think that accent is genetic and was inherited from Irish (close enough to British) mom O'Hara? It is more likely that Mills was incapable of sporting an American accent.

    The other reviewers have already well defined the out-of-time charm of this nice Disney production. Most important to me is the fact that it stays a light movie with good characterization and fine dialogue. However, at over two hours this is way too long for a comedy. The prologue at the camp where the girls meet sets the pedestrian (family?) rhythm. Then, there are very few twists and turns but each are stretched for long sequences. Had the movie been any less good on other accounts - cast & characters, dialogue, settings and production values at large - it would surely look tedious.

    Pretty short-haired Hayley Mills (as Susan Evers) and pretty long-haired Hayley Mills (as Sharon McKendrick) meet at camp and discover they are twins who were separated at birth by divorcing parents Brian Keith (as Mitch) and Maureen O'Hara (as Maggie). At first, the thirteen-year-old girls don't get along, but they soon become fast friends. It doesn't take too much thinking to figure out the plot from here. The twins decide to switch places and bring their parents back together, since neither remarried. But, they must first stop Mr. Keith from marrying gold-digger Joanna Barnes (as Vicky Robinson)... After looking at Maureen O'Hara, I'd consider marrying her. After looking at Mr. Keith's California estate, I'd consider marrying him, too. So, I guess these parents stayed single because, at Ms. Mills deduces, they really do love each other. They sure fight like an old married couple. Why they separated their daughters, and hid them from each other, is inexplicable. While it's never revealed, the daughters must have spent many years in British finishing schools, without running into each other. The "split-screen" is very good, but Mr. Keith's hairpiece does not match properly. Okay, I'm marrying Hayley Mills. ***** The Parent Trap (6/12/61) David Swift ~ Hayley Mills, Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara, Joanna Barnes

    When people watch The Parent Trap, I wonder if they ever notice, like I have, a certain undercurrent of cruelty that even got past Walt Disney's watchful eye. If you didn't catch it, let me point it out: Mitch and Maggie Evers get divorced and decide to let an entire continent separate them. This is realistic so far. But their breakup is obviously so hostile and nasty that one takes Sharon, the other takes Susan, and mutually decide that neither twin shall ever know of their other sibling's existence. This is bad enough on its own. But to add icing to this inedible cake, Mitch and Maggie choose to forget about their other child at the other end of the country. Why inflict this on their girls? They didn't ask to be born, let alone cause the split. Okay, okay, I tend to look a little too close at this stuff today than when I was younger. After all, that is the plot, right? And the twins resolve this parental problem, right? And Disney would never end any movie on a sad note, right? Despite my observation, I enjoyed the rest of the movie. So go pop some popcorn and enjoy.

Hayley mills who quickly rose to stardom and recognition for her superb choice of roles shined in this family dramedy after twin sisters separated at birth after their parents divorce who took one girl each at birth. they would meet years later as teens at a summer camp not knowing the other existed. what ensues is hilarity at every corner and classic slapstick and physical comedy. mills is the perfect choice for the role as if she were born to play it and the added touch is her fun song performance mid-way through the film. i thought the film was perfectly cast and there was just great chemistry between all the actors. it's also nice to see that Maggie was portrayed as a fiercely independent and fiery individual who didn't take nonsense from anyone and stood up for herself. the script was expertly written without the story being overly sappy or melodramatic. plus there weren't any points where it dragged for too long or bored the audience. i didn't much care for the sequels that followed which also starred Hayley mills but as and adult. i recently saw the remake starring Lindsay lohan and it doesn't do it justice. you can't beat the original as it's always the first one you see.

    Hayley Mills here was just in the right place at the right time and in the right role. It turned out to be one of the finest screen performances by a child actor. That this was comedy made Mills' work all the more impressive, for this is a difficult, underrated genre in which to excel. Her every line, gesture and expression was perfect. It was Hayley's greatest work, and a triumph for the Disney Studios. The rest of the cast from Maureen O'Hara (at her most beautiful) to Brian Keith (at his most charming) was ideal. Ditto for the entire supporting cast. A truly wonderful comedy.

    Questionable Disney film with Hayley Mills playing 2 roles; twins whose existence was kept from the other due to an improbable and cold-hearted decision by their selfish, divorced parents played by a lovely Maureen O'Hara and a tubby Brian Keith who's notably lacking in warmth. Mills doesn't make the twins distinctive though the special effects are fine and unobtrusive. The big problem with the film is that the adults are childish and unappealing and Keith and O' Hara don't belong together and what brought them together in the first place remains a mystery. Pity Joanna Barnes who was so good in Auntie Mame (1958), she has a thankless role and has been prematurely aged by hairstyle, make-up and photography. The supporting cast made up of familiar faces is dull and David Swift's direction of this big screen sitcom is anything but swift.

    After watching the 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan, I had to check out the 60's version which I thought was unbelievably filmed well! Firstly, before I start ranting on how great the film was, I will say that I don't think that this film doesn't match the remake. Usually I find remade films worse or less superior than the originals but for some reason I just found some more fun in the remake. The original however I think is still excellent and should still be viewed. The plot centers on two twins who discover each other at a girls camp. They find out who each other's parents are and then they decide to con-cock a mischievous plan into swapping places and getting to know each other's parents before meeting again, trying to reunite their parents. The acting, scenery and settings, music score, unique moments and memorable scenes were put together very well and the entire film still holds up to today's standards. My first thoughts were that the film wasn't going to be great at all and that it wasn't going to beat the remake. I was wrong about it being a well made masterpiece, but I was right about it not beating the remake in my opinion. I thought everything was a little different and more absurd whilst I still found more moments (especially the woods scenes). However, I did find the music a little bit too typical (very 50's-60's styled themed music, it sounded like anything else). Overall, I do love this film. I don't have anything negative to say about it, but there's just something about the remake which I found more special, but then again if we didn't have this film, we wouldn't have the remake!!! Anyway, I really believe the film is one of the best 1960's films, ranking right up with 60's horror such as Black Sabbath and Rosemary's Baby. 8.5/10

    No doubt as a penance for releasing scores of animated films without cogent family units, Disney released The Parent Trap; a Hayley Mills starring, anti-divorce film that had to have felt dated on arrival. In it, a set of estranged identical twins meet by sheer happenstance at camp, trade places, and attempt to bring their divorced parents back together again. The plot immediately appealed to me, even though I had seen the Lindsay Lohan remake. It's a story about the difficulties of preserving the family unit, the unfairness of divorce on young children and the implications of love when faced with the practicalities of life. So naturally Disney sidesteps such themes to make a film as fluffy and unnecessary as a feather boa. Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating a little. The young Hayley Mills who had just started her Disney movie blitz is at her best as the likable twins Susan and Sharon. Both characters have personalities that are just developed enough to tell them apart but in case its too subtle one has a bad case of Long Island lockjaw. Their hijinks are fun, their humor agreeable and the end result is one of the more charming performances to come from a child actor. I'm actually quite concerned for these kids who have to deal with such narcissistic parents. Sure Disney glosses over the reasons why they got divorced in the first place but its easy to see their personalities are just too self-absorbed to be loving partners...or parents. If you're the proud parents of twins or triplets or sextuplets, you'd be able to narrow in on who's Justin and Dustin wouldn't you? That puzzle would be even less difficult if one of them had been a stranger to you for thirteen or so years but this all seems to be above their heads. Its only when one of the twins finally blurts out the truth that the families discover there's something rotten in the state of Massachusetts. The parents get even worse when they reunite and start exchanging rancorous chit-chat. The father (Brian Keith) you see is about to marry a much younger gold digger who, of course, exemplifies the evil stepmother trope we've all come to expect. So it only makes sense that the man's ex-wife (Maureen O'Hara) takes a trip to the coast, unannounced, totting one of two Machiavellian moppets, making catty comments, and dressing in the man's bathrobe. She then prances around the grounds while he's entertaining in a twisted game of hide-and-seek. Once they actually meet up, they of course argue until she literally punches him in the face in front of their kids! By that point, the couple was one mimosa away from "Thunderdome". If either of them were smart they'd get a restraining order against each other and shuttle both kids back and forth between California and Massachusetts. Not an idyllic solution, but its better than living with "The War of the Roses" (1988) 24/7. But alas they do stick it out together in the end because everything is supposed to be cheery, rosy and bright. It's a Disney movie after all; there are no tears in Disney movies! I just fear that kids with divorced parents will see this movie and want to imitate it which is kind of sad when you think about it. Its a hard lesson to learn kids, but sometimes a divorced household is better than one where one parent's in the morgue and the other in jail.

    I first saw this movie on Sunday night TV Wonderful World of Disney in 1979 and was hooked. I bought the book at the school book fair and reread it a dozen times. My older sister had seen Parent Trap in the theater and knew all of the parts that 1970s TV had edited out. In the 1980s I finally got to see the whole film uncut on the Disney cable channel and finally got to figure out "the little dolls signing the parent trap song" my sister spoke of (there was 15 minutes I'd never get back).... Dorky animated cupids aside, as a kid I loved the movie's cross country saga. The camp cabin sabotage, the twins joining forces to prank dad's girlfriend. Although most kids will still enjoy the original movie's favorite kid moments of the punchbowl splashing into a chaperon, the timeless cake falling on Miss Inch's face, and Vicky's hissy fit, the movie's long pace might bore todays kids. Although some purists don't like the new remake of Parent Trap, I thought the remake kept the essence of the original story and updated it to match todays global travel, destigmatization of divorce, etc.

    Girls who look exactly like each other meet at a camp and take a ridiculously long time to figure out that they are twins. This silly comedy has some amusing moments but rambles on far too long, often becoming a drag. The whole premise of each parent taking a twin after divorce with no intention of ever meeting again seems preposterous. It is never explained why the twins speak with a British accent when they were born and brought up in the US. Did the filmmakers think that accent is genetic and was inherited from Irish (close enough to British) mom O'Hara? It is more likely that Mills was incapable of sporting an American accent.

    The other reviewers have already well defined the out-of-time charm of this nice Disney production. Most important to me is the fact that it stays a light movie with good characterization and fine dialogue. However, at over two hours this is way too long for a comedy. The prologue at the camp where the girls meet sets the pedestrian (family?) rhythm. Then, there are very few twists and turns but each are stretched for long sequences. Had the movie been any less good on other accounts - cast & characters, dialogue, settings and production values at large - it would surely look tedious.

    Pretty short-haired Hayley Mills (as Susan Evers) and pretty long-haired Hayley Mills (as Sharon McKendrick) meet at camp and discover they are twins who were separated at birth by divorcing parents Brian Keith (as Mitch) and Maureen O'Hara (as Maggie). At first, the thirteen-year-old girls don't get along, but they soon become fast friends. It doesn't take too much thinking to figure out the plot from here. The twins decide to switch places and bring their parents back together, since neither remarried. But, they must first stop Mr. Keith from marrying gold-digger Joanna Barnes (as Vicky Robinson)... After looking at Maureen O'Hara, I'd consider marrying her. After looking at Mr. Keith's California estate, I'd consider marrying him, too. So, I guess these parents stayed single because, at Ms. Mills deduces, they really do love each other. They sure fight like an old married couple. Why they separated their daughters, and hid them from each other, is inexplicable. While it's never revealed, the daughters must have spent many years in British finishing schools, without running into each other. The "split-screen" is very good, but Mr. Keith's hairpiece does not match properly. Okay, I'm marrying Hayley Mills. ***** The Parent Trap (6/12/61) David Swift ~ Hayley Mills, Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara, Joanna Barnes

    When people watch The Parent Trap, I wonder if they ever notice, like I have, a certain undercurrent of cruelty that even got past Walt Disney's watchful eye. If you didn't catch it, let me point it out: Mitch and Maggie Evers get divorced and decide to let an entire continent separate them. This is realistic so far. But their breakup is obviously so hostile and nasty that one takes Sharon, the other takes Susan, and mutually decide that neither twin shall ever know of their other sibling's existence. This is bad enough on its own. But to add icing to this inedible cake, Mitch and Maggie choose to forget about their other child at the other end of the country. Why inflict this on their girls? They didn't ask to be born, let alone cause the split. Okay, okay, I tend to look a little too close at this stuff today than when I was younger. After all, that is the plot, right? And the twins resolve this parental problem, right? And Disney would never end any movie on a sad note, right? Despite my observation, I enjoyed the rest of the movie. So go pop some popcorn and enjoy.
