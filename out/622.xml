  A Swiss family must survive being shipwrecked on a deserted island.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A family in route to New Guinea is shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. They are forced to remain on the island because of the damage to the ship and the pirates that are roaming the islands. They create a home on the island (centering around a huge tree house) and explore the island and its wildlife. Plenty of adventure ensues as the family deals with issues of survival and pirates, and the brothers must learn how to live on the island with an uncertain future.

    This was one of the first movies I ever saw in a movie theater. It's a lot of fun, imaginative, optimistic, and entertaining. It's still a great family movie. That's all it presumes to be. It's a great vehicle to demonstrate ingenuity in the face of adversity. Classic Disney fare, naive, simple and demonstrating high ideals, morals, and ethics. As to those that think there was any cruelty to animals during the filming: really? Come on. Do you really think the film crew would sic a pair of dogs on a tiger just to film it? This should be re-released to the public, even if only on TV. It's worth letting new generations enjoy it. It's a shame Disneyland has changed the "Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse" into the Tarzan tree-house...

    Swiss Family Robinson (1960) is a boatful of adventure that will make you feel like you're actually in the adventure. The film opens with a family on a ship during a sea storm. It tells the story of the Robinsons (Mother and Father, plus their three sons Fritz, Ernst, and Francis). They are stranded on an island and need to find a way to survive. They build a tree house, find a source of water, and find a way to protect themselves from wild animals. Mother (Dorothy McGuire )debates the future of the family and has to decide to let her older sons Fritz (James MacArthur) and Ernst (Kevin Corcoran) explore the island looking for a way off. The boys rescue Roberta (Janet Munro) from pirates that taken her hostage. After the boys return home, the family sets up traps to protect themselves from the pirates. Meanwhile, both of the older sons fight over Roberta (the only girl in sight)! Swiss Family Robinson is an action-adventure with plenty of comedy. It's a good movie because of its many plot twists and adventure scenes, such as when the family needs to learn how to survive on an uninhabited island with lots of wild animals. The director of Swiss Family Robinson is Ken Annakin. Lowell S. Hawley wrote the screenplay based on Jonathan David Wyss's novel. The movie made over $40 million. It's 126 minutes long, which is the perfect length to tell the story. We give the movie an 83% rating. Swiss Family Robinson isn't a must-see but on a rainy day is will make you feel like you're shipwrecked on your couch without putting you to sleep. by Sam G. Joseph M. Danny G. Michael D.

    There are some films made for children (or, more correctly, featuring children) that have lasted and retain their appeal, such as 'Whistle Down the Wind' or 'The Railway Children'. The 1960 production 'Swiss Family Robinson' was pitched at eight year olds then but is unlikely to satisfy a modern-day eight-year-old. Certainly it should be avoided by any 1960-era eight year old (now 60 year old) tempted to believe the charm can be conjured a second time. In the hands of an imaginative director, the story has elements that might have been made into something lasting. Nothing about this production, however, suggests those involved felt conviction for what they are doing. It looks, sadly, like a cash register in celluloid.

    John Mills was a fine actor, but in this he's a bit like a rocket engine attached to hot-air balloon in this. I'm a fan of old movies, but found this example to be a pretty poor one and not recommended for anyone interested in giving old classics a shot. It's certainly not short of budget or "adventure". Things are happening constantly. Including the most annoying soundtrack I can ever recall. With peculiar incidental music that accompanies absolutely every tiny thing that happens along the way. Constantly. What I found most disturbing, by today's standards, was the many examples of animal cruelty in the film. Including a tiger being harassed by 2 great dane dogs (potentially lethal for the dogs and distressing for the tiger), riding an ostrich and a zebra trapped in mud. All done with real performing animals. Couldn't be rated as a true old classic in my opinion. Probably only thought of fondly by people who saw it when they were young.

    I just downloaded this movie the other day, and really enjoyed this movie, it was good to see James Macarther(Hawaii 5-0 fame) I saw this once back in the 80s and only seen parts of it, but yesterday I got to see it all the way through, it is an awesome movie, the only spot I thought was a little cheesy was James Macarther and Tommy Kirk found the kid under the headband was a girl!!!!!1lololol I was dumb founded, I found myself talking to the t.v Hey guys you mean to tell me you just now figured that out?!!!!! I figured it out when her James& Tommy were running away from the Chinese pirates, going up the hill, I mean come on guys you cant see a woman when you see one???!!!!!!!!! and even THAT was hillariouse! I highly recommend Swiss family Robinson,Michael Smith

    I still love this movie with all its faults. I first saw it around the time of its original release and just loved it. I have seen it countless times and it always entertains me. It is not great art but it does what it does well. John Mills is his usual dependable self as the father and Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran reprise their brother double act that we saw in Old Yeller et al. (a shame that Kirk's career was blighted by his sexuality-shame on you Disney!). I notice a lot of reviewers are concerned about the animals in this film but being Disney I am sure none was harmed.... etc. It is an enjoyable, improbable adventure story that appeals to all ages, so suspend your disbelief and just go with it.

    Walt Disney's "Swiss Family Robinson" - resourceful father John Mills, seamstress mother Dorothy McGuire, cute Tommy Kirk (as Ernst), dreamy James MacArthur (as Fritz), and irritable Kevin Corcoran (as Francis) - are shipwrecked after a pirate attack. They take up residence on an idyllic island paradise, but encounter some dangerous animals. The heart of the story has the older sons leaving the homestead to rescue pretty Janet Munro (as Roberta), disguised as a boy, from pirate Sessue Hayakawa (as Kuala). Director of photography Harry Waxman, production designer John Howell, and their crew are award-worthy. Mr. Kirk and Mr. MacArthur play their arousal well, going from brothers discussing girls, to rivals for Ms. Munro's attentions. In a fun scene, they strip to their waists (Disney wasn't able airbrush out male nipples or navels, apparently) and encourage Munro to do the same; when her hat falls off, they realize she's "a girl!" The most ludicrous scene involves Ms. McGuire being introduced to the extraordinary tree house architected by Mr. Mills; acting like she hadn't noticed it before, she complains about the curtains. ******* Swiss Family Robinson (12/10/60) Ken Annakin ~ James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, John Mills, Janet Munro

    First things off, I absolutely loved the book when I was a kid, but haven't read it for a long time. But I have always loved this film, and at 17 years old I still think it is an absolutely delightful Disney film and perfect for the whole family. Is it the best Disney film ever? Personally, I think not, then again I love Disney so much I cannot choose though I will say Beauty and the Beast especially has been the one that has always captivated me. Swiss Family Robinson is nothing short of excellent. It has wonder, adventure and suspense, with all these elements all of which are crucial for a family film what more can you ask for. The direction from Ken Annakin is rock solid, and the music from William Alwyn is especially stirring. The cinematography is lush, the sets are imaginative and striking and the costumes are lavish. While perhaps slow to begin with, the film has lots of action, pirates and wild animals. The story while not especially faithful to the book, is compelling holds a certain nostalgic value and the screenplay is fun enough. The acting is very good. John Mills was a fine actor, and he is excellent as Father Robinson, and Dorothy McGuire in perfect makeup is even better as Mother Robinson. Appealing performances from James McArthur, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Cocoran help too and Sessue Hayakawa makes an imposing and menacing Pirate Chief, in fact while very attractive Janet Munro is the only one who doesn't quite convince as Roberta, but everything else is so good I am willing to overlook. Other than that, this film is delightful, and teaches some nice family values including bravery, loyalty, honour, creativity and resourcefulness. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    The only thing this movie lacks is Haley Mills. Apparently she was hanging out at the location with her dad when it was being filmed. Too bad old Walt didn't have her do a cameo as a mermaid or something. Anyways, this movie is way better than the book it is based on. I just finished reading it and all the Swiss family do is kill wildlife every other page. If the movie stayed true to the book there would not be much drive in the narrative. The book has no love interest, no pirates, no savages, no Gilligan. I'm sure in the future they will keep making versions of it, but this one sets the gold coconut standard of tropical island fun.

    ... With a super cast, led by British Actor John Mills, "Swiss Family Robinson" (SFR) remains a solid, entertaining film for all ages! And, of course, that famous Tree House is-a-star all-by-itself! Seeing it at Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. was a thrill every time. A believable script, the movie is well-paced and the musical score fits perfectly. Suitable for even younger children, it's not boring for adults! This was the Golden Years for Disney movie-making, starting in the 1950's. Even effective on TV, it's best viewed on the full-screen at your neighborhood theater. It's worth having SFR in your permanent collection-at-home. Tahnk-you for TCM in just airing it. Enjoy!

    There are some films made for children (or, more correctly, featuring children) that have lasted and retain their appeal, such as 'Whistle Down the Wind' or 'The Railway Children'. The 1960 production 'Swiss Family Robinson' was pitched at eight year olds then but is unlikely to satisfy a modern-day eight-year-old. Certainly it should be avoided by any 1960-era eight year old (now 60 year old) tempted to believe the charm can be conjured a second time. In the hands of an imaginative director, the story has elements that might have been made into something lasting. Nothing about this production, however, suggests those involved felt conviction for what they are doing. It looks, sadly, like a cash register in celluloid.

    John Mills was a fine actor, but in this he's a bit like a rocket engine attached to hot-air balloon in this. I'm a fan of old movies, but found this example to be a pretty poor one and not recommended for anyone interested in giving old classics a shot. It's certainly not short of budget or "adventure". Things are happening constantly. Including the most annoying soundtrack I can ever recall. With peculiar incidental music that accompanies absolutely every tiny thing that happens along the way. Constantly. What I found most disturbing, by today's standards, was the many examples of animal cruelty in the film. Including a tiger being harassed by 2 great dane dogs (potentially lethal for the dogs and distressing for the tiger), riding an ostrich and a zebra trapped in mud. All done with real performing animals. Couldn't be rated as a true old classic in my opinion. Probably only thought of fondly by people who saw it when they were young.

    I still love this movie with all its faults. I first saw it around the time of its original release and just loved it. I have seen it countless times and it always entertains me. It is not great art but it does what it does well. John Mills is his usual dependable self as the father and Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran reprise their brother double act that we saw in Old Yeller et al. (a shame that Kirk's career was blighted by his sexuality-shame on you Disney!). I notice a lot of reviewers are concerned about the animals in this film but being Disney I am sure none was harmed.... etc. It is an enjoyable, improbable adventure story that appeals to all ages, so suspend your disbelief and just go with it.

    Walt Disney's "Swiss Family Robinson" - resourceful father John Mills, seamstress mother Dorothy McGuire, cute Tommy Kirk (as Ernst), dreamy James MacArthur (as Fritz), and irritable Kevin Corcoran (as Francis) - are shipwrecked after a pirate attack. They take up residence on an idyllic island paradise, but encounter some dangerous animals. The heart of the story has the older sons leaving the homestead to rescue pretty Janet Munro (as Roberta), disguised as a boy, from pirate Sessue Hayakawa (as Kuala). Director of photography Harry Waxman, production designer John Howell, and their crew are award-worthy. Mr. Kirk and Mr. MacArthur play their arousal well, going from brothers discussing girls, to rivals for Ms. Munro's attentions. In a fun scene, they strip to their waists (Disney wasn't able airbrush out male nipples or navels, apparently) and encourage Munro to do the same; when her hat falls off, they realize she's "a girl!" The most ludicrous scene involves Ms. McGuire being introduced to the extraordinary tree house architected by Mr. Mills; acting like she hadn't noticed it before, she complains about the curtains. ******* Swiss Family Robinson (12/10/60) Ken Annakin ~ James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, John Mills, Janet Munro

    First things off, I absolutely loved the book when I was a kid, but haven't read it for a long time. But I have always loved this film, and at 17 years old I still think it is an absolutely delightful Disney film and perfect for the whole family. Is it the best Disney film ever? Personally, I think not, then again I love Disney so much I cannot choose though I will say Beauty and the Beast especially has been the one that has always captivated me. Swiss Family Robinson is nothing short of excellent. It has wonder, adventure and suspense, with all these elements all of which are crucial for a family film what more can you ask for. The direction from Ken Annakin is rock solid, and the music from William Alwyn is especially stirring. The cinematography is lush, the sets are imaginative and striking and the costumes are lavish. While perhaps slow to begin with, the film has lots of action, pirates and wild animals. The story while not especially faithful to the book, is compelling holds a certain nostalgic value and the screenplay is fun enough. The acting is very good. John Mills was a fine actor, and he is excellent as Father Robinson, and Dorothy McGuire in perfect makeup is even better as Mother Robinson. Appealing performances from James McArthur, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Cocoran help too and Sessue Hayakawa makes an imposing and menacing Pirate Chief, in fact while very attractive Janet Munro is the only one who doesn't quite convince as Roberta, but everything else is so good I am willing to overlook. Other than that, this film is delightful, and teaches some nice family values including bravery, loyalty, honour, creativity and resourcefulness. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    The only thing this movie lacks is Haley Mills. Apparently she was hanging out at the location with her dad when it was being filmed. Too bad old Walt didn't have her do a cameo as a mermaid or something. Anyways, this movie is way better than the book it is based on. I just finished reading it and all the Swiss family do is kill wildlife every other page. If the movie stayed true to the book there would not be much drive in the narrative. The book has no love interest, no pirates, no savages, no Gilligan. I'm sure in the future they will keep making versions of it, but this one sets the gold coconut standard of tropical island fun.

    ... With a super cast, led by British Actor John Mills, "Swiss Family Robinson" (SFR) remains a solid, entertaining film for all ages! And, of course, that famous Tree House is-a-star all-by-itself! Seeing it at Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. was a thrill every time. A believable script, the movie is well-paced and the musical score fits perfectly. Suitable for even younger children, it's not boring for adults! This was the Golden Years for Disney movie-making, starting in the 1950's. Even effective on TV, it's best viewed on the full-screen at your neighborhood theater. It's worth having SFR in your permanent collection-at-home. Tahnk-you for TCM in just airing it. Enjoy!

    This was one of the first movies I ever saw in a movie theater. It's a lot of fun, imaginative, optimistic, and entertaining. It's still a great family movie. That's all it presumes to be. It's a great vehicle to demonstrate ingenuity in the face of adversity. Classic Disney fare, naive, simple and demonstrating high ideals, morals, and ethics. As to those that think there was any cruelty to animals during the filming: really? Come on. Do you really think the film crew would sic a pair of dogs on a tiger just to film it? This should be re-released to the public, even if only on TV. It's worth letting new generations enjoy it. It's a shame Disneyland has changed the "Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse" into the Tarzan tree-house...

    Swiss Family Robinson (1960) is a boatful of adventure that will make you feel like you're actually in the adventure. The film opens with a family on a ship during a sea storm. It tells the story of the Robinsons (Mother and Father, plus their three sons Fritz, Ernst, and Francis). They are stranded on an island and need to find a way to survive. They build a tree house, find a source of water, and find a way to protect themselves from wild animals. Mother (Dorothy McGuire )debates the future of the family and has to decide to let her older sons Fritz (James MacArthur) and Ernst (Kevin Corcoran) explore the island looking for a way off. The boys rescue Roberta (Janet Munro) from pirates that taken her hostage. After the boys return home, the family sets up traps to protect themselves from the pirates. Meanwhile, both of the older sons fight over Roberta (the only girl in sight)! Swiss Family Robinson is an action-adventure with plenty of comedy. It's a good movie because of its many plot twists and adventure scenes, such as when the family needs to learn how to survive on an uninhabited island with lots of wild animals. The director of Swiss Family Robinson is Ken Annakin. Lowell S. Hawley wrote the screenplay based on Jonathan David Wyss's novel. The movie made over $40 million. It's 126 minutes long, which is the perfect length to tell the story. We give the movie an 83% rating. Swiss Family Robinson isn't a must-see but on a rainy day is will make you feel like you're shipwrecked on your couch without putting you to sleep. by Sam G. Joseph M. Danny G. Michael D.

    First things off, I absolutely loved the book when I was a kid, but haven't read it for a long time. But I have always loved this film, and at 17 years old I still think it is an absolutely delightful Disney film and perfect for the whole family. Is it the best Disney film ever? Personally, I think not, then again I love Disney so much I cannot choose though I will say Beauty and the Beast especially has been the one that has always captivated me. Swiss Family Robinson is nothing short of excellent. It has wonder, adventure and suspense, with all these elements all of which are crucial for a family film what more can you ask for. The direction from Ken Annakin is rock solid, and the music from William Alwyn is especially stirring. The cinematography is lush, the sets are imaginative and striking and the costumes are lavish. While perhaps slow to begin with, the film has lots of action, pirates and wild animals. The story while not especially faithful to the book, is compelling holds a certain nostalgic value and the screenplay is fun enough. The acting is very good. John Mills was a fine actor, and he is excellent as Father Robinson, and Dorothy McGuire in perfect makeup is even better as Mother Robinson. Appealing performances from James McArthur, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Cocoran help too and Sessue Hayakawa makes an imposing and menacing Pirate Chief, in fact while very attractive Janet Munro is the only one who doesn't quite convince as Roberta, but everything else is so good I am willing to overlook. Other than that, this film is delightful, and teaches some nice family values including bravery, loyalty, honour, creativity and resourcefulness. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    The only thing this movie lacks is Haley Mills. Apparently she was hanging out at the location with her dad when it was being filmed. Too bad old Walt didn't have her do a cameo as a mermaid or something. Anyways, this movie is way better than the book it is based on. I just finished reading it and all the Swiss family do is kill wildlife every other page. If the movie stayed true to the book there would not be much drive in the narrative. The book has no love interest, no pirates, no savages, no Gilligan. I'm sure in the future they will keep making versions of it, but this one sets the gold coconut standard of tropical island fun.

    ... With a super cast, led by British Actor John Mills, "Swiss Family Robinson" (SFR) remains a solid, entertaining film for all ages! And, of course, that famous Tree House is-a-star all-by-itself! Seeing it at Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. was a thrill every time. A believable script, the movie is well-paced and the musical score fits perfectly. Suitable for even younger children, it's not boring for adults! This was the Golden Years for Disney movie-making, starting in the 1950's. Even effective on TV, it's best viewed on the full-screen at your neighborhood theater. It's worth having SFR in your permanent collection-at-home. Tahnk-you for TCM in just airing it. Enjoy!
