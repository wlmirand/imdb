    You know, I heard about this movie a lot, since it's been repeatedly shown in Brazilian cable; after months of seeing its name, I decided to give it a chance and, oh boy, I made the right decision. "In & Out" is the funniest movie I've seen recently. It has one of the most intelligent stories I have ever seen! Every hilarious scene is filled with irony and self-directed criticism to the own American society, who tries to hide everything that doesn't fit well. The most clever and sarcastic scene is when Howard states he's gay in moment of her wedding, and once his mother hears that, she tries to fix it by saying "he meant he is having a wonderful day". From that moment on, I just kept constantly laughing, getting surprised every while. Other than that, not only directing and writing are great, but the cast is also extremely professional, delivering unexpected situations all the time. It's also interesting to notice how filmmakers show the way men are supposed to behave; we've always been induced to not dance, sing, speak mildly and stuff like that, otherwise we'd be compared to female or homosexual guys, which we should run from. You know, this movie was released in 1997, but current society is still very chauvinist and intolerant, in a point that I don't know if it changed significantly since the nineties. The controversy whether the main character is gay or not is irrelevant in this movie, given that the main pursuit is show how people behave in situations like that-- and I may state it's completely real. So that's it. "In & Out" is one of the most mature, clever and surprising comedies you'll ever get a chance to see. Congratulations for the team!

    This is one of the most horrible films I've ever seen. It's like watching a black liberation film from the 1920s. Yes massah, I is a real person too. I would say I threw up in my mouth a little, but it was frequent enough that I actually had to use the toilet. In all seriousness, I suppose this is reflective of how sad mainstream America was about gay issues only 15 years ago. Everything about the film is trite and clich&eacute;d. The writer (who is gay I guess) and Frank Oz directing are the definition of cowardly. For Christ's sake, the ending is supposed to be funny because you think there might be a gay wedding but, it's just the straight parents renewing their nuptials (haha! gotcha! you can relax). The fact that the cast includes so many famous names only serves to embarrass them, who I'm sure considered themselves at the vanguard for courageously accepting the roles. Congratulations Bob Newheart, you're not so old after all! It's a lesson about tepid pedantry. Anyway, I'm off to stab myself in the throat. Goodbye, cruel world.

    What a waste of time this movie is. The acting was good, but so what? It had me grimacing at most of the unfunny dialogue and stereotypical characters. According to this movie, any man who likes Barbara Striesand movies is gay, and they brought this up three times or more, I mean, sheesh, it wasn't funny the first time, why repeat the "joke"? The whole movie just seemed like some cut and paste scenario we've seen it so many times before, town gets outraged about the main character for whatever reason, then, oh, surprise surprise, they all come round and stand by him in the end, he's a really great guy, we all love him, so what if he's gay, blah blah blah blah blah.... So corny, so boring.

    Stock script of mistaken identity with the standard twist that the mistaken identity is actually real. This is a sweet sanitized story for those who like Oprah and don't question the realities of a story but just go along for the "chick flick" ride. Kevin Kline is a straight teacher who evidently never has been laid and has never really had any sexual urgings at all. He is a teacher who is old enough to have taught a student who has gone on to a TV career but he is dumb enough not to know whether or not he likes to play dingle dangle dingle with the same sex. He is also a humorously tortured buffoon of an English teacher whose whole approach to be noted as being gay as to run around and say "I'm not gay" without people believing him. In other words, the Kline character either has or has not had a hard on in his life. He either has or has not masturbated. If he has not masturbated he has the bluest balls of any English and why for the sake of everything would I care about this character. If he has masturbated then what gets him off? Fantasies about men or women or both? To accept that this character doesn't know he is wanting to have same sex physical contact is as ludicrous as his parents driving up with a 4 tiered wedding cake sitting in the back seat of the station wagon. There is no box around the cake and the wedding is a couple of days off...yet his folks drive around with the cake laying loose in the back seat of the vehicle where one wrong turn could smudge the icing???? Yep...I see stupid people.

    There's nothing wrong with being gay. But this movie shamefully plays on the worn-out stereotype that if a guy likes fashion or musicals or some other activity that's the antithesis of being Mr. Macho, then he must be gay. Most of these myths seem to be spread by guys obsessed with their machoism. They're quick to ridicule any guy who's not a regular beer drinker and always bragging about his sex-capades, and especially any guy who enjoys something only women should like. Unfortunately, too many people buy into this mindset. Beneath it all though, those guys probably have a group-think mindset, and are a bit insecure if some guy isn't part of the herd. If a person is attracted to someone of the opposite sex, they're straight. If they're attracted to someone of the same sex, they're gay. If they're attracted to both, they're bisexual. And it's this sole fact that determines their sexual orientation. Too often, people lose sight of this simple fact.

    In 'In and Out', Kevin Kline plays a repressed gay teacher inadvertently outed by a former student on national television. (The Oscars, no less) He finally comes out with the truth - at the altar on his wedding day. Of course there is a happy ending with him accepting his sexuality, the townfolk accepting him, and, as a sort of bonus prize, his ending up with Tom Selleck, the most perfect man in the universe. Sounds just like real life, doesn't it? Of course a movie can't shatter stereotypes without depicting a few. Our hero is a neat freak and obsessed with Barbra Streisand. His pals even show 'Funny Lady' at his bachelor party. (Odd, most of the gay guys I know are a bit on the sloppy side and can't stand La Streisand.) At times this movie is so sweet your teeth ache, but it is saved by hilarious performances by Joan Cusack as the bride-not-to-be and Matt Dillon as the former student. And Tom Selleck is about as handsome and charming as a human being can be. Oh, and to really up the cute quotient, there is a quartet of little old ladies dacing to Macho Man with their walkers.

    Frank Oz directed 'In & Out' is indeed a Funny film. It gets it's humor right, and there are a couple of sequences that manage to make you laugh. Also, the performances in here, are top-notch! 'In & Out' tells the story of a teacher, played superbly by Kevin Kline, who, begins to question his sexuality after a former student makes a comment about him at the Academy Awards. Paul Rudnick's Screenplay is funnily, inspired by Tom Hanks's speech when he accepted his 1994 Oscar for 'Philadelphia', in which he mentioned his high-school drama coach, and his former classmate, to be, two of the finest gay Americans, he knew. The Writing in the first hour, especially, is hilarious. The climax is absurd, but is mentionable nonetheless. Frank Oz has directed this comedy with ease. Cinematography is perfect. Now to the performances! Kevin Kline is superb, as always. It's indeed time people start calling Kline as a Hollywood Icon! Joan Cusack is fantastic! Matt Dillon as the over-the-top Oscar-winning actor, is extremely amusing. Tom Selleck is lively. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely lovable. Others are perfect. On the whole, A Well-Done Comedy, that truly deserves a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Entertaining and simple. I like the cast that was put together for this movie and like the premise. But it was a little too far fetched at times. We follow a midwest teacher, who is the most epic teacher of all Until one of his former students thanks him at the Oscars while saying that his teacher inspired him, taught him what he knew, and that his former teacher was gay. Blah, blah, this teach is in the middle of wedding plans all hell breaks lose It was a bit of a disappointment. Like Emperor's Club Same actor, just a different story, which is funny because I really like his characters just never the story.

    *Some may view it as a spoiler but the movie is perfectly enjoyable with the spoiler- in some ways, better. However I'll leave that for you to decide* When a former pupil (Matt Dillon) wins an Oscar, in his speech he thanks his 'gay' English teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline). Trouble is, Howard's meant to be getting married to fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) and his small-town neighbours are gossipping. It's a funny script but it's a film that relies on good acting otherwise it might have come off as homophobic. Luckily Kline is endearing as oblivious Howard. The scene where he's listening to his cassette tape of a guide to masculinity is very funny, poking fun at what we consider 'manly' men to be. Joan Cusack is a good support as Howard's fianc&eacute;e. Good lighthearted fun. For those who complain it's dated, the movie can't help it if things have moved on since then. It's not meant to be groundbreaking stuff. The one downfall the film has is that the marketing is not quite straight (so to speak) with us. Watching the trailer, you would assume that Howard was wrongly outed as gay and so the film will poke at stereotypes of masculinity. But by poking fun at gay stereotypes and then having Howard be gay because he fits those stereotypes surely reinforces the idea that men who like poetry or dressing well must be gay, especially as Howard does not seem to harbour sexual feelings towards men. It would have been cleverer to make Howard perfectly straight and decide that he has the right to like whatever he likes without being accused of being gay or not manly. Once you know the plot, it's much more enjoyable. Don't feel cheated because this is a sharp funny comedy.

    A high school English teacher is outed as a gay man by a former student while accepting an Academy Award. Comedy ensues in the teacher's private life and small town where he teaches. Story rumored to be loosely based upon Tom Hanks acceptance speech when receiving his Academy Award for "Philadelphia". I Hope That Last Sentence Is Not True! I Thought This Movie Was Okay. I Thought It Started Great But When Kevin Kline Decides He's Gay The Whole Idea Of The Movie Fell Apart. I Thought That The Movie Would Be About Howard Brackett Trying To Prove To The 270 Million People That He Is Not Gay. The Only Other Joke I Saw In The Movie Past When He Comes Out Of The Closet Was When Joan Cusack Was Chatting Up Tom Selleck & She Asked Him To Be In A Relationship & He Replied "No I'm Actually Gay" & She Runs Outside & Screams "Is Everybody Gay?!?!?!?!?!?!" I Just Had To Laugh At That But The Scene Where Everyone Was Claiming To Be Gay At The Graduation Tried To Be Funny But Only Tried. My Favourite Part Is When Matt Dillon Dedicated The Oscar To Howard Brackett & When He Says "& He's Gay" Its True Comedy. I Love The Expressions Of Everyone Who Is Watching The Oscars Its Pure Gold. I Also Love How When Emily & Howard Turn Off The TV After The Speech There Is A Huge Awkward Pause & When Emily Finally Says "Howard?" Its Gold & The Confused Expression On Kevin Kline's Face As I Mentioned...Is Gold. I Better Stop Saying I Love Aspects Out Of A Movie About A Gay Guy Because The Next Thing I Know Newscamera's Will Follow Me Around & Asking Me "If I'm Gay Or Not"...Just Kidding. I Would Love It If Joan Cusack Won The Oscar She Was Nominated For In This Movie...The Speech Would Be Interesting. All In All A Funny Movie But It Could've Been So Much Better.

I Thought That The Movie Would Be About Howard Brackett Trying To Prove To The 270 Million People That He Is Not Gay. The Only Other Joke I Saw In The Movie Past When He Comes Out Of The Closet Was When Joan Cusack Was Chatting Up Tom Selleck & She Asked Him To Be In A Relationship & He Replied "No I'm Actually Gay" & She Runs Outside & Screams "Is Everybody Gay?!?!?!?!?!?!" I Just Had To Laugh At That But The Scene Where Everyone Was Claiming To Be Gay At The Graduation Tried To Be Funny But Only Tried. My Favourite Part Is When Matt Dillon Dedicated The Oscar To Howard Brackett & When He Says "& He's Gay" Its True Comedy. I Love The Expressions Of Everyone Who Is Watching The Oscars Its Pure Gold. I Also Love How When Emily & Howard Turn Off The TV After The Speech There Is A Huge Awkward Pause & When Emily Finally Says "Howard?" Its Gold & The Confused Expression On Kevin Kline's Face As I Mentioned...Is Gold. I Better Stop Saying I Love Aspects Out Of A Movie About A Gay Guy Because The Next Thing I Know Newscamera's Will Follow Me Around & Asking Me "If I'm Gay Or Not"...Just Kidding. I Would Love It If Joan Cusack Won The Oscar She Was Nominated For In This Movie...The Speech Would Be Interesting. All In All A Funny Movie But It Could've Been So Much Better.

    You know, I heard about this movie a lot, since it's been repeatedly shown in Brazilian cable; after months of seeing its name, I decided to give it a chance and, oh boy, I made the right decision. "In & Out" is the funniest movie I've seen recently. It has one of the most intelligent stories I have ever seen! Every hilarious scene is filled with irony and self-directed criticism to the own American society, who tries to hide everything that doesn't fit well. The most clever and sarcastic scene is when Howard states he's gay in moment of her wedding, and once his mother hears that, she tries to fix it by saying "he meant he is having a wonderful day". From that moment on, I just kept constantly laughing, getting surprised every while. Other than that, not only directing and writing are great, but the cast is also extremely professional, delivering unexpected situations all the time. It's also interesting to notice how filmmakers show the way men are supposed to behave; we've always been induced to not dance, sing, speak mildly and stuff like that, otherwise we'd be compared to female or homosexual guys, which we should run from. You know, this movie was released in 1997, but current society is still very chauvinist and intolerant, in a point that I don't know if it changed significantly since the nineties. The controversy whether the main character is gay or not is irrelevant in this movie, given that the main pursuit is show how people behave in situations like that-- and I may state it's completely real. So that's it. "In & Out" is one of the most mature, clever and surprising comedies you'll ever get a chance to see. Congratulations for the team!

    This is one of the most horrible films I've ever seen. It's like watching a black liberation film from the 1920s. Yes massah, I is a real person too. I would say I threw up in my mouth a little, but it was frequent enough that I actually had to use the toilet. In all seriousness, I suppose this is reflective of how sad mainstream America was about gay issues only 15 years ago. Everything about the film is trite and clich&eacute;d. The writer (who is gay I guess) and Frank Oz directing are the definition of cowardly. For Christ's sake, the ending is supposed to be funny because you think there might be a gay wedding but, it's just the straight parents renewing their nuptials (haha! gotcha! you can relax). The fact that the cast includes so many famous names only serves to embarrass them, who I'm sure considered themselves at the vanguard for courageously accepting the roles. Congratulations Bob Newheart, you're not so old after all! It's a lesson about tepid pedantry. Anyway, I'm off to stab myself in the throat. Goodbye, cruel world.

    What a waste of time this movie is. The acting was good, but so what? It had me grimacing at most of the unfunny dialogue and stereotypical characters. According to this movie, any man who likes Barbara Striesand movies is gay, and they brought this up three times or more, I mean, sheesh, it wasn't funny the first time, why repeat the "joke"? The whole movie just seemed like some cut and paste scenario we've seen it so many times before, town gets outraged about the main character for whatever reason, then, oh, surprise surprise, they all come round and stand by him in the end, he's a really great guy, we all love him, so what if he's gay, blah blah blah blah blah.... So corny, so boring.

    Stock script of mistaken identity with the standard twist that the mistaken identity is actually real. This is a sweet sanitized story for those who like Oprah and don't question the realities of a story but just go along for the "chick flick" ride. Kevin Kline is a straight teacher who evidently never has been laid and has never really had any sexual urgings at all. He is a teacher who is old enough to have taught a student who has gone on to a TV career but he is dumb enough not to know whether or not he likes to play dingle dangle dingle with the same sex. He is also a humorously tortured buffoon of an English teacher whose whole approach to be noted as being gay as to run around and say "I'm not gay" without people believing him. In other words, the Kline character either has or has not had a hard on in his life. He either has or has not masturbated. If he has not masturbated he has the bluest balls of any English and why for the sake of everything would I care about this character. If he has masturbated then what gets him off? Fantasies about men or women or both? To accept that this character doesn't know he is wanting to have same sex physical contact is as ludicrous as his parents driving up with a 4 tiered wedding cake sitting in the back seat of the station wagon. There is no box around the cake and the wedding is a couple of days off...yet his folks drive around with the cake laying loose in the back seat of the vehicle where one wrong turn could smudge the icing???? Yep...I see stupid people.

    There's nothing wrong with being gay. But this movie shamefully plays on the worn-out stereotype that if a guy likes fashion or musicals or some other activity that's the antithesis of being Mr. Macho, then he must be gay. Most of these myths seem to be spread by guys obsessed with their machoism. They're quick to ridicule any guy who's not a regular beer drinker and always bragging about his sex-capades, and especially any guy who enjoys something only women should like. Unfortunately, too many people buy into this mindset. Beneath it all though, those guys probably have a group-think mindset, and are a bit insecure if some guy isn't part of the herd. If a person is attracted to someone of the opposite sex, they're straight. If they're attracted to someone of the same sex, they're gay. If they're attracted to both, they're bisexual. And it's this sole fact that determines their sexual orientation. Too often, people lose sight of this simple fact.

    In 'In and Out', Kevin Kline plays a repressed gay teacher inadvertently outed by a former student on national television. (The Oscars, no less) He finally comes out with the truth - at the altar on his wedding day. Of course there is a happy ending with him accepting his sexuality, the townfolk accepting him, and, as a sort of bonus prize, his ending up with Tom Selleck, the most perfect man in the universe. Sounds just like real life, doesn't it? Of course a movie can't shatter stereotypes without depicting a few. Our hero is a neat freak and obsessed with Barbra Streisand. His pals even show 'Funny Lady' at his bachelor party. (Odd, most of the gay guys I know are a bit on the sloppy side and can't stand La Streisand.) At times this movie is so sweet your teeth ache, but it is saved by hilarious performances by Joan Cusack as the bride-not-to-be and Matt Dillon as the former student. And Tom Selleck is about as handsome and charming as a human being can be. Oh, and to really up the cute quotient, there is a quartet of little old ladies dacing to Macho Man with their walkers.

    Frank Oz directed 'In & Out' is indeed a Funny film. It gets it's humor right, and there are a couple of sequences that manage to make you laugh. Also, the performances in here, are top-notch! 'In & Out' tells the story of a teacher, played superbly by Kevin Kline, who, begins to question his sexuality after a former student makes a comment about him at the Academy Awards. Paul Rudnick's Screenplay is funnily, inspired by Tom Hanks's speech when he accepted his 1994 Oscar for 'Philadelphia', in which he mentioned his high-school drama coach, and his former classmate, to be, two of the finest gay Americans, he knew. The Writing in the first hour, especially, is hilarious. The climax is absurd, but is mentionable nonetheless. Frank Oz has directed this comedy with ease. Cinematography is perfect. Now to the performances! Kevin Kline is superb, as always. It's indeed time people start calling Kline as a Hollywood Icon! Joan Cusack is fantastic! Matt Dillon as the over-the-top Oscar-winning actor, is extremely amusing. Tom Selleck is lively. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely lovable. Others are perfect. On the whole, A Well-Done Comedy, that truly deserves a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Entertaining and simple. I like the cast that was put together for this movie and like the premise. But it was a little too far fetched at times. We follow a midwest teacher, who is the most epic teacher of all Until one of his former students thanks him at the Oscars while saying that his teacher inspired him, taught him what he knew, and that his former teacher was gay. Blah, blah, this teach is in the middle of wedding plans all hell breaks lose It was a bit of a disappointment. Like Emperor's Club Same actor, just a different story, which is funny because I really like his characters just never the story.

    *Some may view it as a spoiler but the movie is perfectly enjoyable with the spoiler- in some ways, better. However I'll leave that for you to decide* When a former pupil (Matt Dillon) wins an Oscar, in his speech he thanks his 'gay' English teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline). Trouble is, Howard's meant to be getting married to fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) and his small-town neighbours are gossipping. It's a funny script but it's a film that relies on good acting otherwise it might have come off as homophobic. Luckily Kline is endearing as oblivious Howard. The scene where he's listening to his cassette tape of a guide to masculinity is very funny, poking fun at what we consider 'manly' men to be. Joan Cusack is a good support as Howard's fianc&eacute;e. Good lighthearted fun. For those who complain it's dated, the movie can't help it if things have moved on since then. It's not meant to be groundbreaking stuff. The one downfall the film has is that the marketing is not quite straight (so to speak) with us. Watching the trailer, you would assume that Howard was wrongly outed as gay and so the film will poke at stereotypes of masculinity. But by poking fun at gay stereotypes and then having Howard be gay because he fits those stereotypes surely reinforces the idea that men who like poetry or dressing well must be gay, especially as Howard does not seem to harbour sexual feelings towards men. It would have been cleverer to make Howard perfectly straight and decide that he has the right to like whatever he likes without being accused of being gay or not manly. Once you know the plot, it's much more enjoyable. Don't feel cheated because this is a sharp funny comedy.

I Just Had To Laugh At That But The Scene Where Everyone Was Claiming To Be Gay At The Graduation Tried To Be Funny But Only Tried. My Favourite Part Is When Matt Dillon Dedicated The Oscar To Howard Brackett & When He Says "& He's Gay" Its True Comedy. I Love The Expressions Of Everyone Who Is Watching The Oscars Its Pure Gold. I Also Love How When Emily & Howard Turn Off The TV After The Speech There Is A Huge Awkward Pause & When Emily Finally Says "Howard?" Its Gold & The Confused Expression On Kevin Kline's Face As I Mentioned...Is Gold. I Better Stop Saying I Love Aspects Out Of A Movie About A Gay Guy Because The Next Thing I Know Newscamera's Will Follow Me Around & Asking Me "If I'm Gay Or Not"...Just Kidding. I Would Love It If Joan Cusack Won The Oscar She Was Nominated For In This Movie...The Speech Would Be Interesting. All In All A Funny Movie But It Could've Been So Much Better.

    You know, I heard about this movie a lot, since it's been repeatedly shown in Brazilian cable; after months of seeing its name, I decided to give it a chance and, oh boy, I made the right decision. "In & Out" is the funniest movie I've seen recently. It has one of the most intelligent stories I have ever seen! Every hilarious scene is filled with irony and self-directed criticism to the own American society, who tries to hide everything that doesn't fit well. The most clever and sarcastic scene is when Howard states he's gay in moment of her wedding, and once his mother hears that, she tries to fix it by saying "he meant he is having a wonderful day". From that moment on, I just kept constantly laughing, getting surprised every while. Other than that, not only directing and writing are great, but the cast is also extremely professional, delivering unexpected situations all the time. It's also interesting to notice how filmmakers show the way men are supposed to behave; we've always been induced to not dance, sing, speak mildly and stuff like that, otherwise we'd be compared to female or homosexual guys, which we should run from. You know, this movie was released in 1997, but current society is still very chauvinist and intolerant, in a point that I don't know if it changed significantly since the nineties. The controversy whether the main character is gay or not is irrelevant in this movie, given that the main pursuit is show how people behave in situations like that-- and I may state it's completely real. So that's it. "In & Out" is one of the most mature, clever and surprising comedies you'll ever get a chance to see. Congratulations for the team!

    This is one of the most horrible films I've ever seen. It's like watching a black liberation film from the 1920s. Yes massah, I is a real person too. I would say I threw up in my mouth a little, but it was frequent enough that I actually had to use the toilet. In all seriousness, I suppose this is reflective of how sad mainstream America was about gay issues only 15 years ago. Everything about the film is trite and clich&eacute;d. The writer (who is gay I guess) and Frank Oz directing are the definition of cowardly. For Christ's sake, the ending is supposed to be funny because you think there might be a gay wedding but, it's just the straight parents renewing their nuptials (haha! gotcha! you can relax). The fact that the cast includes so many famous names only serves to embarrass them, who I'm sure considered themselves at the vanguard for courageously accepting the roles. Congratulations Bob Newheart, you're not so old after all! It's a lesson about tepid pedantry. Anyway, I'm off to stab myself in the throat. Goodbye, cruel world.

    What a waste of time this movie is. The acting was good, but so what? It had me grimacing at most of the unfunny dialogue and stereotypical characters. According to this movie, any man who likes Barbara Striesand movies is gay, and they brought this up three times or more, I mean, sheesh, it wasn't funny the first time, why repeat the "joke"? The whole movie just seemed like some cut and paste scenario we've seen it so many times before, town gets outraged about the main character for whatever reason, then, oh, surprise surprise, they all come round and stand by him in the end, he's a really great guy, we all love him, so what if he's gay, blah blah blah blah blah.... So corny, so boring.

    Stock script of mistaken identity with the standard twist that the mistaken identity is actually real. This is a sweet sanitized story for those who like Oprah and don't question the realities of a story but just go along for the "chick flick" ride. Kevin Kline is a straight teacher who evidently never has been laid and has never really had any sexual urgings at all. He is a teacher who is old enough to have taught a student who has gone on to a TV career but he is dumb enough not to know whether or not he likes to play dingle dangle dingle with the same sex. He is also a humorously tortured buffoon of an English teacher whose whole approach to be noted as being gay as to run around and say "I'm not gay" without people believing him. In other words, the Kline character either has or has not had a hard on in his life. He either has or has not masturbated. If he has not masturbated he has the bluest balls of any English and why for the sake of everything would I care about this character. If he has masturbated then what gets him off? Fantasies about men or women or both? To accept that this character doesn't know he is wanting to have same sex physical contact is as ludicrous as his parents driving up with a 4 tiered wedding cake sitting in the back seat of the station wagon. There is no box around the cake and the wedding is a couple of days off...yet his folks drive around with the cake laying loose in the back seat of the vehicle where one wrong turn could smudge the icing???? Yep...I see stupid people.

    There's nothing wrong with being gay. But this movie shamefully plays on the worn-out stereotype that if a guy likes fashion or musicals or some other activity that's the antithesis of being Mr. Macho, then he must be gay. Most of these myths seem to be spread by guys obsessed with their machoism. They're quick to ridicule any guy who's not a regular beer drinker and always bragging about his sex-capades, and especially any guy who enjoys something only women should like. Unfortunately, too many people buy into this mindset. Beneath it all though, those guys probably have a group-think mindset, and are a bit insecure if some guy isn't part of the herd. If a person is attracted to someone of the opposite sex, they're straight. If they're attracted to someone of the same sex, they're gay. If they're attracted to both, they're bisexual. And it's this sole fact that determines their sexual orientation. Too often, people lose sight of this simple fact.

    In 'In and Out', Kevin Kline plays a repressed gay teacher inadvertently outed by a former student on national television. (The Oscars, no less) He finally comes out with the truth - at the altar on his wedding day. Of course there is a happy ending with him accepting his sexuality, the townfolk accepting him, and, as a sort of bonus prize, his ending up with Tom Selleck, the most perfect man in the universe. Sounds just like real life, doesn't it? Of course a movie can't shatter stereotypes without depicting a few. Our hero is a neat freak and obsessed with Barbra Streisand. His pals even show 'Funny Lady' at his bachelor party. (Odd, most of the gay guys I know are a bit on the sloppy side and can't stand La Streisand.) At times this movie is so sweet your teeth ache, but it is saved by hilarious performances by Joan Cusack as the bride-not-to-be and Matt Dillon as the former student. And Tom Selleck is about as handsome and charming as a human being can be. Oh, and to really up the cute quotient, there is a quartet of little old ladies dacing to Macho Man with their walkers.

    Frank Oz directed 'In & Out' is indeed a Funny film. It gets it's humor right, and there are a couple of sequences that manage to make you laugh. Also, the performances in here, are top-notch! 'In & Out' tells the story of a teacher, played superbly by Kevin Kline, who, begins to question his sexuality after a former student makes a comment about him at the Academy Awards. Paul Rudnick's Screenplay is funnily, inspired by Tom Hanks's speech when he accepted his 1994 Oscar for 'Philadelphia', in which he mentioned his high-school drama coach, and his former classmate, to be, two of the finest gay Americans, he knew. The Writing in the first hour, especially, is hilarious. The climax is absurd, but is mentionable nonetheless. Frank Oz has directed this comedy with ease. Cinematography is perfect. Now to the performances! Kevin Kline is superb, as always. It's indeed time people start calling Kline as a Hollywood Icon! Joan Cusack is fantastic! Matt Dillon as the over-the-top Oscar-winning actor, is extremely amusing. Tom Selleck is lively. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely lovable. Others are perfect. On the whole, A Well-Done Comedy, that truly deserves a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Entertaining and simple. I like the cast that was put together for this movie and like the premise. But it was a little too far fetched at times. We follow a midwest teacher, who is the most epic teacher of all Until one of his former students thanks him at the Oscars while saying that his teacher inspired him, taught him what he knew, and that his former teacher was gay. Blah, blah, this teach is in the middle of wedding plans all hell breaks lose It was a bit of a disappointment. Like Emperor's Club Same actor, just a different story, which is funny because I really like his characters just never the story.

    *Some may view it as a spoiler but the movie is perfectly enjoyable with the spoiler- in some ways, better. However I'll leave that for you to decide* When a former pupil (Matt Dillon) wins an Oscar, in his speech he thanks his 'gay' English teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline). Trouble is, Howard's meant to be getting married to fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) and his small-town neighbours are gossipping. It's a funny script but it's a film that relies on good acting otherwise it might have come off as homophobic. Luckily Kline is endearing as oblivious Howard. The scene where he's listening to his cassette tape of a guide to masculinity is very funny, poking fun at what we consider 'manly' men to be. Joan Cusack is a good support as Howard's fianc&eacute;e. Good lighthearted fun. For those who complain it's dated, the movie can't help it if things have moved on since then. It's not meant to be groundbreaking stuff. The one downfall the film has is that the marketing is not quite straight (so to speak) with us. Watching the trailer, you would assume that Howard was wrongly outed as gay and so the film will poke at stereotypes of masculinity. But by poking fun at gay stereotypes and then having Howard be gay because he fits those stereotypes surely reinforces the idea that men who like poetry or dressing well must be gay, especially as Howard does not seem to harbour sexual feelings towards men. It would have been cleverer to make Howard perfectly straight and decide that he has the right to like whatever he likes without being accused of being gay or not manly. Once you know the plot, it's much more enjoyable. Don't feel cheated because this is a sharp funny comedy.

    A high school English teacher is outed as a gay man by a former student while accepting an Academy Award. Comedy ensues in the teacher's private life and small town where he teaches. Story rumored to be loosely based upon Tom Hanks acceptance speech when receiving his Academy Award for "Philadelphia". I Hope That Last Sentence Is Not True! I Thought This Movie Was Okay. I Thought It Started Great But When Kevin Kline Decides He's Gay The Whole Idea Of The Movie Fell Apart. I Thought That The Movie Would Be About Howard Brackett Trying To Prove To The 270 Million People That He Is Not Gay. The Only Other Joke I Saw In The Movie Past When He Comes Out Of The Closet Was When Joan Cusack Was Chatting Up Tom Selleck & She Asked Him To Be In A Relationship & He Replied "No I'm Actually Gay" & She Runs Outside & Screams "Is Everybody Gay?!?!?!?!?!?!"

My Favourite Part Is When Matt Dillon Dedicated The Oscar To Howard Brackett & When He Says "& He's Gay" Its True Comedy. I Love The Expressions Of Everyone Who Is Watching The Oscars Its Pure Gold. I Also Love How When Emily & Howard Turn Off The TV After The Speech There Is A Huge Awkward Pause & When Emily Finally Says "Howard?" Its Gold & The Confused Expression On Kevin Kline's Face As I Mentioned...Is Gold. I Better Stop Saying I Love Aspects Out Of A Movie About A Gay Guy Because The Next Thing I Know Newscamera's Will Follow Me Around & Asking Me "If I'm Gay Or Not"...Just Kidding. I Would Love It If Joan Cusack Won The Oscar She Was Nominated For In This Movie...The Speech Would Be Interesting. All In All A Funny Movie But It Could've Been So Much Better.

    You know, I heard about this movie a lot, since it's been repeatedly shown in Brazilian cable; after months of seeing its name, I decided to give it a chance and, oh boy, I made the right decision. "In & Out" is the funniest movie I've seen recently. It has one of the most intelligent stories I have ever seen! Every hilarious scene is filled with irony and self-directed criticism to the own American society, who tries to hide everything that doesn't fit well. The most clever and sarcastic scene is when Howard states he's gay in moment of her wedding, and once his mother hears that, she tries to fix it by saying "he meant he is having a wonderful day". From that moment on, I just kept constantly laughing, getting surprised every while. Other than that, not only directing and writing are great, but the cast is also extremely professional, delivering unexpected situations all the time. It's also interesting to notice how filmmakers show the way men are supposed to behave; we've always been induced to not dance, sing, speak mildly and stuff like that, otherwise we'd be compared to female or homosexual guys, which we should run from. You know, this movie was released in 1997, but current society is still very chauvinist and intolerant, in a point that I don't know if it changed significantly since the nineties. The controversy whether the main character is gay or not is irrelevant in this movie, given that the main pursuit is show how people behave in situations like that-- and I may state it's completely real. So that's it. "In & Out" is one of the most mature, clever and surprising comedies you'll ever get a chance to see. Congratulations for the team!

    This is one of the most horrible films I've ever seen. It's like watching a black liberation film from the 1920s. Yes massah, I is a real person too. I would say I threw up in my mouth a little, but it was frequent enough that I actually had to use the toilet. In all seriousness, I suppose this is reflective of how sad mainstream America was about gay issues only 15 years ago. Everything about the film is trite and clich&eacute;d. The writer (who is gay I guess) and Frank Oz directing are the definition of cowardly. For Christ's sake, the ending is supposed to be funny because you think there might be a gay wedding but, it's just the straight parents renewing their nuptials (haha! gotcha! you can relax). The fact that the cast includes so many famous names only serves to embarrass them, who I'm sure considered themselves at the vanguard for courageously accepting the roles. Congratulations Bob Newheart, you're not so old after all! It's a lesson about tepid pedantry. Anyway, I'm off to stab myself in the throat. Goodbye, cruel world.

    What a waste of time this movie is. The acting was good, but so what? It had me grimacing at most of the unfunny dialogue and stereotypical characters. According to this movie, any man who likes Barbara Striesand movies is gay, and they brought this up three times or more, I mean, sheesh, it wasn't funny the first time, why repeat the "joke"? The whole movie just seemed like some cut and paste scenario we've seen it so many times before, town gets outraged about the main character for whatever reason, then, oh, surprise surprise, they all come round and stand by him in the end, he's a really great guy, we all love him, so what if he's gay, blah blah blah blah blah.... So corny, so boring.

    Stock script of mistaken identity with the standard twist that the mistaken identity is actually real. This is a sweet sanitized story for those who like Oprah and don't question the realities of a story but just go along for the "chick flick" ride. Kevin Kline is a straight teacher who evidently never has been laid and has never really had any sexual urgings at all. He is a teacher who is old enough to have taught a student who has gone on to a TV career but he is dumb enough not to know whether or not he likes to play dingle dangle dingle with the same sex. He is also a humorously tortured buffoon of an English teacher whose whole approach to be noted as being gay as to run around and say "I'm not gay" without people believing him. In other words, the Kline character either has or has not had a hard on in his life. He either has or has not masturbated. If he has not masturbated he has the bluest balls of any English and why for the sake of everything would I care about this character. If he has masturbated then what gets him off? Fantasies about men or women or both? To accept that this character doesn't know he is wanting to have same sex physical contact is as ludicrous as his parents driving up with a 4 tiered wedding cake sitting in the back seat of the station wagon. There is no box around the cake and the wedding is a couple of days off...yet his folks drive around with the cake laying loose in the back seat of the vehicle where one wrong turn could smudge the icing???? Yep...I see stupid people.

    There's nothing wrong with being gay. But this movie shamefully plays on the worn-out stereotype that if a guy likes fashion or musicals or some other activity that's the antithesis of being Mr. Macho, then he must be gay. Most of these myths seem to be spread by guys obsessed with their machoism. They're quick to ridicule any guy who's not a regular beer drinker and always bragging about his sex-capades, and especially any guy who enjoys something only women should like. Unfortunately, too many people buy into this mindset. Beneath it all though, those guys probably have a group-think mindset, and are a bit insecure if some guy isn't part of the herd. If a person is attracted to someone of the opposite sex, they're straight. If they're attracted to someone of the same sex, they're gay. If they're attracted to both, they're bisexual. And it's this sole fact that determines their sexual orientation. Too often, people lose sight of this simple fact.

    In 'In and Out', Kevin Kline plays a repressed gay teacher inadvertently outed by a former student on national television. (The Oscars, no less) He finally comes out with the truth - at the altar on his wedding day. Of course there is a happy ending with him accepting his sexuality, the townfolk accepting him, and, as a sort of bonus prize, his ending up with Tom Selleck, the most perfect man in the universe. Sounds just like real life, doesn't it? Of course a movie can't shatter stereotypes without depicting a few. Our hero is a neat freak and obsessed with Barbra Streisand. His pals even show 'Funny Lady' at his bachelor party. (Odd, most of the gay guys I know are a bit on the sloppy side and can't stand La Streisand.) At times this movie is so sweet your teeth ache, but it is saved by hilarious performances by Joan Cusack as the bride-not-to-be and Matt Dillon as the former student. And Tom Selleck is about as handsome and charming as a human being can be. Oh, and to really up the cute quotient, there is a quartet of little old ladies dacing to Macho Man with their walkers.

    Frank Oz directed 'In & Out' is indeed a Funny film. It gets it's humor right, and there are a couple of sequences that manage to make you laugh. Also, the performances in here, are top-notch! 'In & Out' tells the story of a teacher, played superbly by Kevin Kline, who, begins to question his sexuality after a former student makes a comment about him at the Academy Awards. Paul Rudnick's Screenplay is funnily, inspired by Tom Hanks's speech when he accepted his 1994 Oscar for 'Philadelphia', in which he mentioned his high-school drama coach, and his former classmate, to be, two of the finest gay Americans, he knew. The Writing in the first hour, especially, is hilarious. The climax is absurd, but is mentionable nonetheless. Frank Oz has directed this comedy with ease. Cinematography is perfect. Now to the performances! Kevin Kline is superb, as always. It's indeed time people start calling Kline as a Hollywood Icon! Joan Cusack is fantastic! Matt Dillon as the over-the-top Oscar-winning actor, is extremely amusing. Tom Selleck is lively. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely lovable. Others are perfect. On the whole, A Well-Done Comedy, that truly deserves a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Entertaining and simple. I like the cast that was put together for this movie and like the premise. But it was a little too far fetched at times. We follow a midwest teacher, who is the most epic teacher of all Until one of his former students thanks him at the Oscars while saying that his teacher inspired him, taught him what he knew, and that his former teacher was gay. Blah, blah, this teach is in the middle of wedding plans all hell breaks lose It was a bit of a disappointment. Like Emperor's Club Same actor, just a different story, which is funny because I really like his characters just never the story.

    *Some may view it as a spoiler but the movie is perfectly enjoyable with the spoiler- in some ways, better. However I'll leave that for you to decide* When a former pupil (Matt Dillon) wins an Oscar, in his speech he thanks his 'gay' English teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline). Trouble is, Howard's meant to be getting married to fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) and his small-town neighbours are gossipping. It's a funny script but it's a film that relies on good acting otherwise it might have come off as homophobic. Luckily Kline is endearing as oblivious Howard. The scene where he's listening to his cassette tape of a guide to masculinity is very funny, poking fun at what we consider 'manly' men to be. Joan Cusack is a good support as Howard's fianc&eacute;e. Good lighthearted fun. For those who complain it's dated, the movie can't help it if things have moved on since then. It's not meant to be groundbreaking stuff. The one downfall the film has is that the marketing is not quite straight (so to speak) with us. Watching the trailer, you would assume that Howard was wrongly outed as gay and so the film will poke at stereotypes of masculinity. But by poking fun at gay stereotypes and then having Howard be gay because he fits those stereotypes surely reinforces the idea that men who like poetry or dressing well must be gay, especially as Howard does not seem to harbour sexual feelings towards men. It would have been cleverer to make Howard perfectly straight and decide that he has the right to like whatever he likes without being accused of being gay or not manly. Once you know the plot, it's much more enjoyable. Don't feel cheated because this is a sharp funny comedy.

    A high school English teacher is outed as a gay man by a former student while accepting an Academy Award. Comedy ensues in the teacher's private life and small town where he teaches. Story rumored to be loosely based upon Tom Hanks acceptance speech when receiving his Academy Award for "Philadelphia". I Hope That Last Sentence Is Not True! I Thought This Movie Was Okay. I Thought It Started Great But When Kevin Kline Decides He's Gay The Whole Idea Of The Movie Fell Apart. I Thought That The Movie Would Be About Howard Brackett Trying To Prove To The 270 Million People That He Is Not Gay. The Only Other Joke I Saw In The Movie Past When He Comes Out Of The Closet Was When Joan Cusack Was Chatting Up Tom Selleck & She Asked Him To Be In A Relationship & He Replied "No I'm Actually Gay" & She Runs Outside & Screams "Is Everybody Gay?!?!?!?!?!?!"

I Also Love How When Emily & Howard Turn Off The TV After The Speech There Is A Huge Awkward Pause & When Emily Finally Says "Howard?" Its Gold & The Confused Expression On Kevin Kline's Face As I Mentioned...Is Gold. I Better Stop Saying I Love Aspects Out Of A Movie About A Gay Guy Because The Next Thing I Know Newscamera's Will Follow Me Around & Asking Me "If I'm Gay Or Not"...Just Kidding. I Would Love It If Joan Cusack Won The Oscar She Was Nominated For In This Movie...The Speech Would Be Interesting. All In All A Funny Movie But It Could've Been So Much Better.

    You know, I heard about this movie a lot, since it's been repeatedly shown in Brazilian cable; after months of seeing its name, I decided to give it a chance and, oh boy, I made the right decision. "In & Out" is the funniest movie I've seen recently. It has one of the most intelligent stories I have ever seen! Every hilarious scene is filled with irony and self-directed criticism to the own American society, who tries to hide everything that doesn't fit well. The most clever and sarcastic scene is when Howard states he's gay in moment of her wedding, and once his mother hears that, she tries to fix it by saying "he meant he is having a wonderful day". From that moment on, I just kept constantly laughing, getting surprised every while. Other than that, not only directing and writing are great, but the cast is also extremely professional, delivering unexpected situations all the time. It's also interesting to notice how filmmakers show the way men are supposed to behave; we've always been induced to not dance, sing, speak mildly and stuff like that, otherwise we'd be compared to female or homosexual guys, which we should run from. You know, this movie was released in 1997, but current society is still very chauvinist and intolerant, in a point that I don't know if it changed significantly since the nineties. The controversy whether the main character is gay or not is irrelevant in this movie, given that the main pursuit is show how people behave in situations like that-- and I may state it's completely real. So that's it. "In & Out" is one of the most mature, clever and surprising comedies you'll ever get a chance to see. Congratulations for the team!

    This is one of the most horrible films I've ever seen. It's like watching a black liberation film from the 1920s. Yes massah, I is a real person too. I would say I threw up in my mouth a little, but it was frequent enough that I actually had to use the toilet. In all seriousness, I suppose this is reflective of how sad mainstream America was about gay issues only 15 years ago. Everything about the film is trite and clich&eacute;d. The writer (who is gay I guess) and Frank Oz directing are the definition of cowardly. For Christ's sake, the ending is supposed to be funny because you think there might be a gay wedding but, it's just the straight parents renewing their nuptials (haha! gotcha! you can relax). The fact that the cast includes so many famous names only serves to embarrass them, who I'm sure considered themselves at the vanguard for courageously accepting the roles. Congratulations Bob Newheart, you're not so old after all! It's a lesson about tepid pedantry. Anyway, I'm off to stab myself in the throat. Goodbye, cruel world.

    What a waste of time this movie is. The acting was good, but so what? It had me grimacing at most of the unfunny dialogue and stereotypical characters. According to this movie, any man who likes Barbara Striesand movies is gay, and they brought this up three times or more, I mean, sheesh, it wasn't funny the first time, why repeat the "joke"? The whole movie just seemed like some cut and paste scenario we've seen it so many times before, town gets outraged about the main character for whatever reason, then, oh, surprise surprise, they all come round and stand by him in the end, he's a really great guy, we all love him, so what if he's gay, blah blah blah blah blah.... So corny, so boring.

    Stock script of mistaken identity with the standard twist that the mistaken identity is actually real. This is a sweet sanitized story for those who like Oprah and don't question the realities of a story but just go along for the "chick flick" ride. Kevin Kline is a straight teacher who evidently never has been laid and has never really had any sexual urgings at all. He is a teacher who is old enough to have taught a student who has gone on to a TV career but he is dumb enough not to know whether or not he likes to play dingle dangle dingle with the same sex. He is also a humorously tortured buffoon of an English teacher whose whole approach to be noted as being gay as to run around and say "I'm not gay" without people believing him. In other words, the Kline character either has or has not had a hard on in his life. He either has or has not masturbated. If he has not masturbated he has the bluest balls of any English and why for the sake of everything would I care about this character. If he has masturbated then what gets him off? Fantasies about men or women or both? To accept that this character doesn't know he is wanting to have same sex physical contact is as ludicrous as his parents driving up with a 4 tiered wedding cake sitting in the back seat of the station wagon. There is no box around the cake and the wedding is a couple of days off...yet his folks drive around with the cake laying loose in the back seat of the vehicle where one wrong turn could smudge the icing???? Yep...I see stupid people.

    There's nothing wrong with being gay. But this movie shamefully plays on the worn-out stereotype that if a guy likes fashion or musicals or some other activity that's the antithesis of being Mr. Macho, then he must be gay. Most of these myths seem to be spread by guys obsessed with their machoism. They're quick to ridicule any guy who's not a regular beer drinker and always bragging about his sex-capades, and especially any guy who enjoys something only women should like. Unfortunately, too many people buy into this mindset. Beneath it all though, those guys probably have a group-think mindset, and are a bit insecure if some guy isn't part of the herd. If a person is attracted to someone of the opposite sex, they're straight. If they're attracted to someone of the same sex, they're gay. If they're attracted to both, they're bisexual. And it's this sole fact that determines their sexual orientation. Too often, people lose sight of this simple fact.

    In 'In and Out', Kevin Kline plays a repressed gay teacher inadvertently outed by a former student on national television. (The Oscars, no less) He finally comes out with the truth - at the altar on his wedding day. Of course there is a happy ending with him accepting his sexuality, the townfolk accepting him, and, as a sort of bonus prize, his ending up with Tom Selleck, the most perfect man in the universe. Sounds just like real life, doesn't it? Of course a movie can't shatter stereotypes without depicting a few. Our hero is a neat freak and obsessed with Barbra Streisand. His pals even show 'Funny Lady' at his bachelor party. (Odd, most of the gay guys I know are a bit on the sloppy side and can't stand La Streisand.) At times this movie is so sweet your teeth ache, but it is saved by hilarious performances by Joan Cusack as the bride-not-to-be and Matt Dillon as the former student. And Tom Selleck is about as handsome and charming as a human being can be. Oh, and to really up the cute quotient, there is a quartet of little old ladies dacing to Macho Man with their walkers.

    Frank Oz directed 'In & Out' is indeed a Funny film. It gets it's humor right, and there are a couple of sequences that manage to make you laugh. Also, the performances in here, are top-notch! 'In & Out' tells the story of a teacher, played superbly by Kevin Kline, who, begins to question his sexuality after a former student makes a comment about him at the Academy Awards. Paul Rudnick's Screenplay is funnily, inspired by Tom Hanks's speech when he accepted his 1994 Oscar for 'Philadelphia', in which he mentioned his high-school drama coach, and his former classmate, to be, two of the finest gay Americans, he knew. The Writing in the first hour, especially, is hilarious. The climax is absurd, but is mentionable nonetheless. Frank Oz has directed this comedy with ease. Cinematography is perfect. Now to the performances! Kevin Kline is superb, as always. It's indeed time people start calling Kline as a Hollywood Icon! Joan Cusack is fantastic! Matt Dillon as the over-the-top Oscar-winning actor, is extremely amusing. Tom Selleck is lively. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely lovable. Others are perfect. On the whole, A Well-Done Comedy, that truly deserves a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Entertaining and simple. I like the cast that was put together for this movie and like the premise. But it was a little too far fetched at times. We follow a midwest teacher, who is the most epic teacher of all Until one of his former students thanks him at the Oscars while saying that his teacher inspired him, taught him what he knew, and that his former teacher was gay. Blah, blah, this teach is in the middle of wedding plans all hell breaks lose It was a bit of a disappointment. Like Emperor's Club Same actor, just a different story, which is funny because I really like his characters just never the story.

    *Some may view it as a spoiler but the movie is perfectly enjoyable with the spoiler- in some ways, better. However I'll leave that for you to decide* When a former pupil (Matt Dillon) wins an Oscar, in his speech he thanks his 'gay' English teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline). Trouble is, Howard's meant to be getting married to fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) and his small-town neighbours are gossipping. It's a funny script but it's a film that relies on good acting otherwise it might have come off as homophobic. Luckily Kline is endearing as oblivious Howard. The scene where he's listening to his cassette tape of a guide to masculinity is very funny, poking fun at what we consider 'manly' men to be. Joan Cusack is a good support as Howard's fianc&eacute;e. Good lighthearted fun. For those who complain it's dated, the movie can't help it if things have moved on since then. It's not meant to be groundbreaking stuff. The one downfall the film has is that the marketing is not quite straight (so to speak) with us. Watching the trailer, you would assume that Howard was wrongly outed as gay and so the film will poke at stereotypes of masculinity. But by poking fun at gay stereotypes and then having Howard be gay because he fits those stereotypes surely reinforces the idea that men who like poetry or dressing well must be gay, especially as Howard does not seem to harbour sexual feelings towards men. It would have been cleverer to make Howard perfectly straight and decide that he has the right to like whatever he likes without being accused of being gay or not manly. Once you know the plot, it's much more enjoyable. Don't feel cheated because this is a sharp funny comedy.

    A high school English teacher is outed as a gay man by a former student while accepting an Academy Award. Comedy ensues in the teacher's private life and small town where he teaches. Story rumored to be loosely based upon Tom Hanks acceptance speech when receiving his Academy Award for "Philadelphia". I Hope That Last Sentence Is Not True! I Thought This Movie Was Okay. I Thought It Started Great But When Kevin Kline Decides He's Gay The Whole Idea Of The Movie Fell Apart. I Thought That The Movie Would Be About Howard Brackett Trying To Prove To The 270 Million People That He Is Not Gay. The Only Other Joke I Saw In The Movie Past When He Comes Out Of The Closet Was When Joan Cusack Was Chatting Up Tom Selleck & She Asked Him To Be In A Relationship & He Replied "No I'm Actually Gay" & She Runs Outside & Screams "Is Everybody Gay?!?!?!?!?!?!" I Just Had To Laugh At That But The Scene Where Everyone Was Claiming To Be Gay At The Graduation Tried To Be Funny But Only Tried. My Favourite Part Is When Matt Dillon Dedicated The Oscar To Howard Brackett & When He Says "& He's Gay" Its True Comedy. I Love The Expressions Of Everyone Who Is Watching The Oscars Its Pure Gold.

I Better Stop Saying I Love Aspects Out Of A Movie About A Gay Guy Because The Next Thing I Know Newscamera's Will Follow Me Around & Asking Me "If I'm Gay Or Not"...Just Kidding. I Would Love It If Joan Cusack Won The Oscar She Was Nominated For In This Movie...The Speech Would Be Interesting. All In All A Funny Movie But It Could've Been So Much Better.
