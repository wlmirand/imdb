 <sinopse>
  Rich Mr. Dashwood dies, leaving his second wife and her three daughters poor by the rules of inheritance. The two eldest daughters are the titular opposites.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  When Mr. Dashwood dies, he must leave the bulk of his estate to the son by his first marriage, which leaves his second wife and their three daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret) in straitened circumstances. They are taken in by a kindly cousin, but their lack of fortune affects the marriageability of both practical Elinor and romantic Marianne. When Elinor forms an attachment for the wealthy Edward Ferrars, his family disapproves and separates them. And though Mrs. Jennings tries to match the worthy (and rich) Colonel Brandon to her, Marianne finds the dashing and fiery John Willoughby more to her taste. Both relationships are sorely tried.

    Before The tigers crouched and the dragons hid, before the boys of mountain Brokeback, there was Ang Lee's masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, that invites everyone's attention for. It is probably the best adaptation of Sense and Sensibility (Jane Austen's novel) you will ever see, with stellar performances by Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, all who give award worthy emotions throughout the film. I found "Sense and Sensibilty" to be one of the most charming movies with a warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, many of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best as per my perception. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay. Sense and Sensibility stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as sisters, who are left poor after their rich father dies and leaves all his wealth to his son from his earlier marriage, making both the sisters poison for their future husbands because of the lack of their ability to offer dowry. This doesn't stop them from love, however, which causes many problems and heart breaks. Thompson is the 'sensible one as She is reserved and nurturing, while Winslet is the overtly passionate and artistic one. Their acting, as well as the excellent supporting cast's performances are wonderful and believable. However, the real star of the movie is the direction The incredible landscapes and the beautiful cinematography is a character in itself. In one particular scene, Winslet is taking a walk after hearing some unfortunate news, and the very atmosphere around her envelops her and makes the scene so much more fulfilling. Ang Lee is a brilliant artist, and has shown such amazing versatility with his portfolio of work that anytime I hear that a new Lee film is going to be released, I go crazy. MY RATING: 8/10

    OK, it's not Pride and Prejudice, but still such a lovely, evocative film. Makes one painfully aware of the old law of primogeniture and the financial difficulties it incurred. Besides the incomparable Emma Thompson, so many other great actors completed their roles to perfection Long before she was known as the survivor on Titanic, Kate Winslet made a lovely contribution into a heady company and held her own beautifully. As well the young actress who portrayed Margaret Dashwood, offered some nice comedy relief and smiles. And he small, role played by Hugh Laurie is so fun. And he comes to the rescue when Marianne falls ill. Such a bizarre thing to see they were still 'bleeding' patients. How very bizarre against modern medicine. There are so many unsung heroes in this movie, not the least of which is Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, and even the actor who portrays Willouby. That actor later married Emma Thompson, so he must be the right sort. Watch it for the lovely, largely accurate portrayal of the times. As in all these movies, I think 'thank goodness' the bows and curtsey's are a thing of the past. A lovely, lovely movie, is you like this sort of thing.

    I think this is one of the most well-made beautiful movies I've ever seen. It makes me cry every time I see it. The romance, the scenery, the music - it tears at my heart. The romantic part of it is so enduring, as is everything else about it. I've seen it about 10 times and I'm sure I will watch it many more times. The characters are all, in my opinion, well played. The acting is superb. The more I see it, the more I love it. I love it much better than the book. It's makes me yearn to step back into 19th century England. I have not seen a movie this good in many years. Thank you everyone who was involved for making this wonderful movie. I just love it.

    I've seriously never seen a film based on any Jane Austen novel, and I've never read an Austen novel. It's just not the type of novel that would really intrigue me all that much. But this film, for what it was, was pretty good. I definitely saw it so I could see I had see Ang Lee's "Big Four", after loving Life of Pi and Brokeback Mountain. It's nowhere near as great as those, but the acting, especially by Thompson and Winslet, is really great. I think the end is a all way too tidy, and I heard there are quite a few changes in many of the characterizations between this and the novel, but for what it is, it's pretty good and definitely something to admire.

    Sense and Sensibility is another great work from Ang Lee. He is director who can work in any genre and add a lot to great story. His fantastic ability to tell stories and bring out heartfelt and very human performances is just amazing. Like any other film by Ang Lee, Sense and Sensibility is slowly paced, beautifully shot and features a fantastic score. He knows where to put the camera and his films always benefit from beautiful cinematography. By far the strongest element of the film is the script by Emma Thompson. She manages to balance the wit and sophistication with powerful drama and great sense of humor. The dialog was fantastic and the direction perfectly complimented the material. The performances in Sense and Sensibility were great. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet was an absolute joy to watch. They gave this film an energy and true emotion that is lacking in most of current day actresses. But by far my favorite was Alan Rickman. It was very nice to see him playing a very nice and honorable person for a change. Close second was Hugh Laurie, you see him, you'll understand. But it was all around a very strong cast without any weak links. There really isn't much flaws to be found in Sense and Sensibility that would bother me. Yes it's kinda slow, but so are nearly every film by Ang Lee. And I really appreciate films that can take there time. In other words Sense and Sensibility is a must see for anyone who wish to see a smart, funny and very touching period romance. It has a fantastic cast, great script and steady direction by Ang Lee. It's a chick flick worth seeing.

    "Sense And Sensibility" is a film by the master Ang Lee from the novel by Jane Austen. The script is written by the original point of view of Emma Thompson who also plays Elinor Dashwood. The film centers about two sisters who are completely different. The elder,Elinor(Emma Thompson) is wise ,prudent,practical and taciturn in regards of her own feelings. The younger,Marianne(Kate Winslet)is passionate,fantasist absolutist in her ideas and she can't absolutely hide her emotions.After Mr.Dashwood death their marriage opportunities are definitely damaged. The point is how could Elinor and Marianne overgrow their own lack of balance in their attitude towards love? The direction is spectacular and poetical and Ang Lee is able to film really overwhelming sequences. It has to be said that sometimes costume dramas are only a chance to built extraordinary film sets with nothing particularly original interpretations but "Sense and Sensibility" is quite the opposite. It is faithful to the original source but it is nonetheless an important showcase of a not ordinary direction and truly inspired and brilliant performances. The acting is absolutely superb in every way. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are truly in command of their characters and express every single beat with great accomplishment. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. This coupled with a really lovely soundtrack makes this film particularly beautiful. My vote is 8/10.

    n extremely spot-on movie, it deserves to be up there with Airplane! and The Naked Gun in the best 'stupid-funny' films of all time. If you read the blurb on the back of the box you will probably not go any further. But give it a go - it's a real heart warming laugh out loud film. The film ended up being a little sillier than I would have liked, particularly in terms of the relationship between Larry and Iris, and putting Steve Lawrence in your film is never a good thing (although we should all be thankful Edie wasn't with him), but Sense and Sensibility is certainly a powerfu TV movie that should resonate with everyone who has ever been lonely (and I think that's just about every one of us). I am amazed at how many people have never heard of this film, let alone seen it. Go watch it now - I guarantee you'll be quoting it for months.

    I've long resisted period drama, citing it as nostalgic pomp for elderly ladies and as all the so called classics, involved gooey and rather non- sensical 'romance', that made them even more boring. Middle age, naturally, started to change that plus a greater understanding and respect for the genre. It IS largely about the only thing that British film-makers can reliably do well, right? Except, of course, Taiwanese master-director Ang Lee got hold of this one, serenely pumping it with majesty, poise and prose. Not a second of running time is wasted, the pacing is perfect, every frame counts. The casting, some of which on their own and in average quality films can be awful (Hugh Grant, for instance), along with Emma Thompson's simple but eloquent Oscar winning script, turn these bit actors into very good ones. Those who are reading this and other reviews will surely know the story of Mr Darcy and co., probably much better than I do, so I'm not going there. One of my all-time favourites, Kate Winslett, is superb, of course, radiating both naivety and female knowing, often at the same time. Emma Thompson, here as her older sister Elinor Dashwood, is usually someone - or usually plays people - that I don't like much - but here she is totally natural and convincing. Looking at the list of filming locations on the IMDb, so many were within ten miles of where I live (Salisbury) and I have visited, that that reality is very intense. The locations are always beautifully and sympathetically portrayed and presented and indeed, many are quite modest, compared to other adaptations, which is all for the better. This film has been on TV quite a few times and will always be, it's an evergreen classic, a rare thing in that both critics and public adore it equally. I actually bought the DVD, in a box-set along with 'Pride & Prejudice' and 'Atonement', both directed by Joe Wright. If someone told me that I'd be buying films about foppy people in floppy bonnets ten years ago, I'd just have looked them blankly in the face....

    Incredibly enjoyable movie with vivid characters. It was really cool to see a cast of so many people who became so famous later on. Kate winslet is gorgeous and plays the passionate sister to a t. Emma Thompson's face and whole demeanor make her perfectly suited to her role as well. When i saw Hugh Laurie from House i was like What! There he is! Mr Sarcastic Dr. House! Even Professor Snape from Harry Potter has an important part (Alan Rickman)and i love his unique voice most of all, though he is a fine actor as well. Finally, I really enjoyed Hugh Grant's stiff, humble walk and speech. What a charismatic actor.

    The movie is so long (about 130 minutes). But it didn't made me feel bore. Because what Ang Lee did with directory and Emma did with Screenplay is superb. So magical on what Emma translated the word in Jane Austen's novel to her Screenplay. The Movie is so charming, especially with hugh grant in it. Although he is still 'Hugh Grant', but the quirkiness inside Hugh's personality made him a likable leading male. For Kate Winslet, it safe to say that she is is a scene stealer in this movie. Emma Thompson is great in front of the camera. And it is so refreshing to see Alan Rickman taking a role as a nice englishman with a charm. Ang Lee + Emma's screenplay + top notch acting = 'must see' movie/'must own the DVD' movie.

    Before The tigers crouched and the dragons hid, before the boys of mountain Brokeback, there was Ang Lee's masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, that invites everyone's attention for. It is probably the best adaptation of Sense and Sensibility (Jane Austen's novel) you will ever see, with stellar performances by Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, all who give award worthy emotions throughout the film. I found "Sense and Sensibilty" to be one of the most charming movies with a warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, many of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best as per my perception. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay. Sense and Sensibility stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as sisters, who are left poor after their rich father dies and leaves all his wealth to his son from his earlier marriage, making both the sisters poison for their future husbands because of the lack of their ability to offer dowry. This doesn't stop them from love, however, which causes many problems and heart breaks. Thompson is the 'sensible one as She is reserved and nurturing, while Winslet is the overtly passionate and artistic one. Their acting, as well as the excellent supporting cast's performances are wonderful and believable. However, the real star of the movie is the direction The incredible landscapes and the beautiful cinematography is a character in itself. In one particular scene, Winslet is taking a walk after hearing some unfortunate news, and the very atmosphere around her envelops her and makes the scene so much more fulfilling. Ang Lee is a brilliant artist, and has shown such amazing versatility with his portfolio of work that anytime I hear that a new Lee film is going to be released, I go crazy. MY RATING: 8/10

    OK, it's not Pride and Prejudice, but still such a lovely, evocative film. Makes one painfully aware of the old law of primogeniture and the financial difficulties it incurred. Besides the incomparable Emma Thompson, so many other great actors completed their roles to perfection Long before she was known as the survivor on Titanic, Kate Winslet made a lovely contribution into a heady company and held her own beautifully. As well the young actress who portrayed Margaret Dashwood, offered some nice comedy relief and smiles. And he small, role played by Hugh Laurie is so fun. And he comes to the rescue when Marianne falls ill. Such a bizarre thing to see they were still 'bleeding' patients. How very bizarre against modern medicine. There are so many unsung heroes in this movie, not the least of which is Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, and even the actor who portrays Willouby. That actor later married Emma Thompson, so he must be the right sort. Watch it for the lovely, largely accurate portrayal of the times. As in all these movies, I think 'thank goodness' the bows and curtsey's are a thing of the past. A lovely, lovely movie, is you like this sort of thing.

    I think this is one of the most well-made beautiful movies I've ever seen. It makes me cry every time I see it. The romance, the scenery, the music - it tears at my heart. The romantic part of it is so enduring, as is everything else about it. I've seen it about 10 times and I'm sure I will watch it many more times. The characters are all, in my opinion, well played. The acting is superb. The more I see it, the more I love it. I love it much better than the book. It's makes me yearn to step back into 19th century England. I have not seen a movie this good in many years. Thank you everyone who was involved for making this wonderful movie. I just love it.

    I've seriously never seen a film based on any Jane Austen novel, and I've never read an Austen novel. It's just not the type of novel that would really intrigue me all that much. But this film, for what it was, was pretty good. I definitely saw it so I could see I had see Ang Lee's "Big Four", after loving Life of Pi and Brokeback Mountain. It's nowhere near as great as those, but the acting, especially by Thompson and Winslet, is really great. I think the end is a all way too tidy, and I heard there are quite a few changes in many of the characterizations between this and the novel, but for what it is, it's pretty good and definitely something to admire.

    Sense and Sensibility is another great work from Ang Lee. He is director who can work in any genre and add a lot to great story. His fantastic ability to tell stories and bring out heartfelt and very human performances is just amazing. Like any other film by Ang Lee, Sense and Sensibility is slowly paced, beautifully shot and features a fantastic score. He knows where to put the camera and his films always benefit from beautiful cinematography. By far the strongest element of the film is the script by Emma Thompson. She manages to balance the wit and sophistication with powerful drama and great sense of humor. The dialog was fantastic and the direction perfectly complimented the material. The performances in Sense and Sensibility were great. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet was an absolute joy to watch. They gave this film an energy and true emotion that is lacking in most of current day actresses. But by far my favorite was Alan Rickman. It was very nice to see him playing a very nice and honorable person for a change. Close second was Hugh Laurie, you see him, you'll understand. But it was all around a very strong cast without any weak links. There really isn't much flaws to be found in Sense and Sensibility that would bother me. Yes it's kinda slow, but so are nearly every film by Ang Lee. And I really appreciate films that can take there time. In other words Sense and Sensibility is a must see for anyone who wish to see a smart, funny and very touching period romance. It has a fantastic cast, great script and steady direction by Ang Lee. It's a chick flick worth seeing.

    "Sense And Sensibility" is a film by the master Ang Lee from the novel by Jane Austen. The script is written by the original point of view of Emma Thompson who also plays Elinor Dashwood. The film centers about two sisters who are completely different. The elder,Elinor(Emma Thompson) is wise ,prudent,practical and taciturn in regards of her own feelings. The younger,Marianne(Kate Winslet)is passionate,fantasist absolutist in her ideas and she can't absolutely hide her emotions.After Mr.Dashwood death their marriage opportunities are definitely damaged. The point is how could Elinor and Marianne overgrow their own lack of balance in their attitude towards love? The direction is spectacular and poetical and Ang Lee is able to film really overwhelming sequences. It has to be said that sometimes costume dramas are only a chance to built extraordinary film sets with nothing particularly original interpretations but "Sense and Sensibility" is quite the opposite. It is faithful to the original source but it is nonetheless an important showcase of a not ordinary direction and truly inspired and brilliant performances. The acting is absolutely superb in every way. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are truly in command of their characters and express every single beat with great accomplishment. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. This coupled with a really lovely soundtrack makes this film particularly beautiful. My vote is 8/10.

    n extremely spot-on movie, it deserves to be up there with Airplane! and The Naked Gun in the best 'stupid-funny' films of all time. If you read the blurb on the back of the box you will probably not go any further. But give it a go - it's a real heart warming laugh out loud film. The film ended up being a little sillier than I would have liked, particularly in terms of the relationship between Larry and Iris, and putting Steve Lawrence in your film is never a good thing (although we should all be thankful Edie wasn't with him), but Sense and Sensibility is certainly a powerfu TV movie that should resonate with everyone who has ever been lonely (and I think that's just about every one of us). I am amazed at how many people have never heard of this film, let alone seen it. Go watch it now - I guarantee you'll be quoting it for months.

    I've long resisted period drama, citing it as nostalgic pomp for elderly ladies and as all the so called classics, involved gooey and rather non- sensical 'romance', that made them even more boring. Middle age, naturally, started to change that plus a greater understanding and respect for the genre. It IS largely about the only thing that British film-makers can reliably do well, right? Except, of course, Taiwanese master-director Ang Lee got hold of this one, serenely pumping it with majesty, poise and prose. Not a second of running time is wasted, the pacing is perfect, every frame counts. The casting, some of which on their own and in average quality films can be awful (Hugh Grant, for instance), along with Emma Thompson's simple but eloquent Oscar winning script, turn these bit actors into very good ones. Those who are reading this and other reviews will surely know the story of Mr Darcy and co., probably much better than I do, so I'm not going there. One of my all-time favourites, Kate Winslett, is superb, of course, radiating both naivety and female knowing, often at the same time. Emma Thompson, here as her older sister Elinor Dashwood, is usually someone - or usually plays people - that I don't like much - but here she is totally natural and convincing. Looking at the list of filming locations on the IMDb, so many were within ten miles of where I live (Salisbury) and I have visited, that that reality is very intense. The locations are always beautifully and sympathetically portrayed and presented and indeed, many are quite modest, compared to other adaptations, which is all for the better. This film has been on TV quite a few times and will always be, it's an evergreen classic, a rare thing in that both critics and public adore it equally. I actually bought the DVD, in a box-set along with 'Pride & Prejudice' and 'Atonement', both directed by Joe Wright. If someone told me that I'd be buying films about foppy people in floppy bonnets ten years ago, I'd just have looked them blankly in the face....

    Incredibly enjoyable movie with vivid characters. It was really cool to see a cast of so many people who became so famous later on. Kate winslet is gorgeous and plays the passionate sister to a t. Emma Thompson's face and whole demeanor make her perfectly suited to her role as well. When i saw Hugh Laurie from House i was like What! There he is! Mr Sarcastic Dr. House! Even Professor Snape from Harry Potter has an important part (Alan Rickman)and i love his unique voice most of all, though he is a fine actor as well. Finally, I really enjoyed Hugh Grant's stiff, humble walk and speech. What a charismatic actor.

    The movie is so long (about 130 minutes). But it didn't made me feel bore. Because what Ang Lee did with directory and Emma did with Screenplay is superb. So magical on what Emma translated the word in Jane Austen's novel to her Screenplay. The Movie is so charming, especially with hugh grant in it. Although he is still 'Hugh Grant', but the quirkiness inside Hugh's personality made him a likable leading male. For Kate Winslet, it safe to say that she is is a scene stealer in this movie. Emma Thompson is great in front of the camera. And it is so refreshing to see Alan Rickman taking a role as a nice englishman with a charm. Ang Lee + Emma's screenplay + top notch acting = 'must see' movie/'must own the DVD' movie.

Besides the incomparable Emma Thompson, so many other great actors completed their roles to perfection Long before she was known as the survivor on Titanic, Kate Winslet made a lovely contribution into a heady company and held her own beautifully. As well the young actress who portrayed Margaret Dashwood, offered some nice comedy relief and smiles. And he small, role played by Hugh Laurie is so fun. And he comes to the rescue when Marianne falls ill. Such a bizarre thing to see they were still 'bleeding' patients. How very bizarre against modern medicine. There are so many unsung heroes in this movie, not the least of which is Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, and even the actor who portrays Willouby. That actor later married Emma Thompson, so he must be the right sort. Watch it for the lovely, largely accurate portrayal of the times. As in all these movies, I think 'thank goodness' the bows and curtsey's are a thing of the past. A lovely, lovely movie, is you like this sort of thing.

    I think this is one of the most well-made beautiful movies I've ever seen. It makes me cry every time I see it. The romance, the scenery, the music - it tears at my heart. The romantic part of it is so enduring, as is everything else about it. I've seen it about 10 times and I'm sure I will watch it many more times. The characters are all, in my opinion, well played. The acting is superb. The more I see it, the more I love it. I love it much better than the book. It's makes me yearn to step back into 19th century England. I have not seen a movie this good in many years. Thank you everyone who was involved for making this wonderful movie. I just love it.

    I've seriously never seen a film based on any Jane Austen novel, and I've never read an Austen novel. It's just not the type of novel that would really intrigue me all that much. But this film, for what it was, was pretty good. I definitely saw it so I could see I had see Ang Lee's "Big Four", after loving Life of Pi and Brokeback Mountain. It's nowhere near as great as those, but the acting, especially by Thompson and Winslet, is really great. I think the end is a all way too tidy, and I heard there are quite a few changes in many of the characterizations between this and the novel, but for what it is, it's pretty good and definitely something to admire.

    Sense and Sensibility is another great work from Ang Lee. He is director who can work in any genre and add a lot to great story. His fantastic ability to tell stories and bring out heartfelt and very human performances is just amazing. Like any other film by Ang Lee, Sense and Sensibility is slowly paced, beautifully shot and features a fantastic score. He knows where to put the camera and his films always benefit from beautiful cinematography. By far the strongest element of the film is the script by Emma Thompson. She manages to balance the wit and sophistication with powerful drama and great sense of humor. The dialog was fantastic and the direction perfectly complimented the material. The performances in Sense and Sensibility were great. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet was an absolute joy to watch. They gave this film an energy and true emotion that is lacking in most of current day actresses. But by far my favorite was Alan Rickman. It was very nice to see him playing a very nice and honorable person for a change. Close second was Hugh Laurie, you see him, you'll understand. But it was all around a very strong cast without any weak links. There really isn't much flaws to be found in Sense and Sensibility that would bother me. Yes it's kinda slow, but so are nearly every film by Ang Lee. And I really appreciate films that can take there time. In other words Sense and Sensibility is a must see for anyone who wish to see a smart, funny and very touching period romance. It has a fantastic cast, great script and steady direction by Ang Lee. It's a chick flick worth seeing.

    "Sense And Sensibility" is a film by the master Ang Lee from the novel by Jane Austen. The script is written by the original point of view of Emma Thompson who also plays Elinor Dashwood. The film centers about two sisters who are completely different. The elder,Elinor(Emma Thompson) is wise ,prudent,practical and taciturn in regards of her own feelings. The younger,Marianne(Kate Winslet)is passionate,fantasist absolutist in her ideas and she can't absolutely hide her emotions.After Mr.Dashwood death their marriage opportunities are definitely damaged. The point is how could Elinor and Marianne overgrow their own lack of balance in their attitude towards love? The direction is spectacular and poetical and Ang Lee is able to film really overwhelming sequences. It has to be said that sometimes costume dramas are only a chance to built extraordinary film sets with nothing particularly original interpretations but "Sense and Sensibility" is quite the opposite. It is faithful to the original source but it is nonetheless an important showcase of a not ordinary direction and truly inspired and brilliant performances. The acting is absolutely superb in every way. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are truly in command of their characters and express every single beat with great accomplishment. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. This coupled with a really lovely soundtrack makes this film particularly beautiful. My vote is 8/10.

    n extremely spot-on movie, it deserves to be up there with Airplane! and The Naked Gun in the best 'stupid-funny' films of all time. If you read the blurb on the back of the box you will probably not go any further. But give it a go - it's a real heart warming laugh out loud film. The film ended up being a little sillier than I would have liked, particularly in terms of the relationship between Larry and Iris, and putting Steve Lawrence in your film is never a good thing (although we should all be thankful Edie wasn't with him), but Sense and Sensibility is certainly a powerfu TV movie that should resonate with everyone who has ever been lonely (and I think that's just about every one of us). I am amazed at how many people have never heard of this film, let alone seen it. Go watch it now - I guarantee you'll be quoting it for months.

    I've long resisted period drama, citing it as nostalgic pomp for elderly ladies and as all the so called classics, involved gooey and rather non- sensical 'romance', that made them even more boring. Middle age, naturally, started to change that plus a greater understanding and respect for the genre. It IS largely about the only thing that British film-makers can reliably do well, right? Except, of course, Taiwanese master-director Ang Lee got hold of this one, serenely pumping it with majesty, poise and prose. Not a second of running time is wasted, the pacing is perfect, every frame counts. The casting, some of which on their own and in average quality films can be awful (Hugh Grant, for instance), along with Emma Thompson's simple but eloquent Oscar winning script, turn these bit actors into very good ones. Those who are reading this and other reviews will surely know the story of Mr Darcy and co., probably much better than I do, so I'm not going there. One of my all-time favourites, Kate Winslett, is superb, of course, radiating both naivety and female knowing, often at the same time. Emma Thompson, here as her older sister Elinor Dashwood, is usually someone - or usually plays people - that I don't like much - but here she is totally natural and convincing. Looking at the list of filming locations on the IMDb, so many were within ten miles of where I live (Salisbury) and I have visited, that that reality is very intense. The locations are always beautifully and sympathetically portrayed and presented and indeed, many are quite modest, compared to other adaptations, which is all for the better. This film has been on TV quite a few times and will always be, it's an evergreen classic, a rare thing in that both critics and public adore it equally. I actually bought the DVD, in a box-set along with 'Pride & Prejudice' and 'Atonement', both directed by Joe Wright. If someone told me that I'd be buying films about foppy people in floppy bonnets ten years ago, I'd just have looked them blankly in the face....

    Incredibly enjoyable movie with vivid characters. It was really cool to see a cast of so many people who became so famous later on. Kate winslet is gorgeous and plays the passionate sister to a t. Emma Thompson's face and whole demeanor make her perfectly suited to her role as well. When i saw Hugh Laurie from House i was like What! There he is! Mr Sarcastic Dr. House! Even Professor Snape from Harry Potter has an important part (Alan Rickman)and i love his unique voice most of all, though he is a fine actor as well. Finally, I really enjoyed Hugh Grant's stiff, humble walk and speech. What a charismatic actor.

    The movie is so long (about 130 minutes). But it didn't made me feel bore. Because what Ang Lee did with directory and Emma did with Screenplay is superb. So magical on what Emma translated the word in Jane Austen's novel to her Screenplay. The Movie is so charming, especially with hugh grant in it. Although he is still 'Hugh Grant', but the quirkiness inside Hugh's personality made him a likable leading male. For Kate Winslet, it safe to say that she is is a scene stealer in this movie. Emma Thompson is great in front of the camera. And it is so refreshing to see Alan Rickman taking a role as a nice englishman with a charm. Ang Lee + Emma's screenplay + top notch acting = 'must see' movie/'must own the DVD' movie.

    Before The tigers crouched and the dragons hid, before the boys of mountain Brokeback, there was Ang Lee's masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, that invites everyone's attention for. It is probably the best adaptation of Sense and Sensibility (Jane Austen's novel) you will ever see, with stellar performances by Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, all who give award worthy emotions throughout the film. I found "Sense and Sensibilty" to be one of the most charming movies with a warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, many of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best as per my perception. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay. Sense and Sensibility stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as sisters, who are left poor after their rich father dies and leaves all his wealth to his son from his earlier marriage, making both the sisters poison for their future husbands because of the lack of their ability to offer dowry. This doesn't stop them from love, however, which causes many problems and heart breaks. Thompson is the 'sensible one as She is reserved and nurturing, while Winslet is the overtly passionate and artistic one. Their acting, as well as the excellent supporting cast's performances are wonderful and believable. However, the real star of the movie is the direction The incredible landscapes and the beautiful cinematography is a character in itself. In one particular scene, Winslet is taking a walk after hearing some unfortunate news, and the very atmosphere around her envelops her and makes the scene so much more fulfilling. Ang Lee is a brilliant artist, and has shown such amazing versatility with his portfolio of work that anytime I hear that a new Lee film is going to be released, I go crazy. MY RATING: 8/10

    I've seriously never seen a film based on any Jane Austen novel, and I've never read an Austen novel. It's just not the type of novel that would really intrigue me all that much. But this film, for what it was, was pretty good. I definitely saw it so I could see I had see Ang Lee's "Big Four", after loving Life of Pi and Brokeback Mountain. It's nowhere near as great as those, but the acting, especially by Thompson and Winslet, is really great. I think the end is a all way too tidy, and I heard there are quite a few changes in many of the characterizations between this and the novel, but for what it is, it's pretty good and definitely something to admire.

    Sense and Sensibility is another great work from Ang Lee. He is director who can work in any genre and add a lot to great story. His fantastic ability to tell stories and bring out heartfelt and very human performances is just amazing. Like any other film by Ang Lee, Sense and Sensibility is slowly paced, beautifully shot and features a fantastic score. He knows where to put the camera and his films always benefit from beautiful cinematography. By far the strongest element of the film is the script by Emma Thompson. She manages to balance the wit and sophistication with powerful drama and great sense of humor. The dialog was fantastic and the direction perfectly complimented the material. The performances in Sense and Sensibility were great. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet was an absolute joy to watch. They gave this film an energy and true emotion that is lacking in most of current day actresses. But by far my favorite was Alan Rickman. It was very nice to see him playing a very nice and honorable person for a change. Close second was Hugh Laurie, you see him, you'll understand. But it was all around a very strong cast without any weak links. There really isn't much flaws to be found in Sense and Sensibility that would bother me. Yes it's kinda slow, but so are nearly every film by Ang Lee. And I really appreciate films that can take there time. In other words Sense and Sensibility is a must see for anyone who wish to see a smart, funny and very touching period romance. It has a fantastic cast, great script and steady direction by Ang Lee. It's a chick flick worth seeing.

    "Sense And Sensibility" is a film by the master Ang Lee from the novel by Jane Austen. The script is written by the original point of view of Emma Thompson who also plays Elinor Dashwood. The film centers about two sisters who are completely different. The elder,Elinor(Emma Thompson) is wise ,prudent,practical and taciturn in regards of her own feelings. The younger,Marianne(Kate Winslet)is passionate,fantasist absolutist in her ideas and she can't absolutely hide her emotions.After Mr.Dashwood death their marriage opportunities are definitely damaged. The point is how could Elinor and Marianne overgrow their own lack of balance in their attitude towards love? The direction is spectacular and poetical and Ang Lee is able to film really overwhelming sequences. It has to be said that sometimes costume dramas are only a chance to built extraordinary film sets with nothing particularly original interpretations but "Sense and Sensibility" is quite the opposite. It is faithful to the original source but it is nonetheless an important showcase of a not ordinary direction and truly inspired and brilliant performances. The acting is absolutely superb in every way. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are truly in command of their characters and express every single beat with great accomplishment. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. This coupled with a really lovely soundtrack makes this film particularly beautiful. My vote is 8/10.

    n extremely spot-on movie, it deserves to be up there with Airplane! and The Naked Gun in the best 'stupid-funny' films of all time. If you read the blurb on the back of the box you will probably not go any further. But give it a go - it's a real heart warming laugh out loud film. The film ended up being a little sillier than I would have liked, particularly in terms of the relationship between Larry and Iris, and putting Steve Lawrence in your film is never a good thing (although we should all be thankful Edie wasn't with him), but Sense and Sensibility is certainly a powerfu TV movie that should resonate with everyone who has ever been lonely (and I think that's just about every one of us). I am amazed at how many people have never heard of this film, let alone seen it. Go watch it now - I guarantee you'll be quoting it for months.

    I've long resisted period drama, citing it as nostalgic pomp for elderly ladies and as all the so called classics, involved gooey and rather non- sensical 'romance', that made them even more boring. Middle age, naturally, started to change that plus a greater understanding and respect for the genre. It IS largely about the only thing that British film-makers can reliably do well, right? Except, of course, Taiwanese master-director Ang Lee got hold of this one, serenely pumping it with majesty, poise and prose. Not a second of running time is wasted, the pacing is perfect, every frame counts. The casting, some of which on their own and in average quality films can be awful (Hugh Grant, for instance), along with Emma Thompson's simple but eloquent Oscar winning script, turn these bit actors into very good ones. Those who are reading this and other reviews will surely know the story of Mr Darcy and co., probably much better than I do, so I'm not going there. One of my all-time favourites, Kate Winslett, is superb, of course, radiating both naivety and female knowing, often at the same time. Emma Thompson, here as her older sister Elinor Dashwood, is usually someone - or usually plays people - that I don't like much - but here she is totally natural and convincing. Looking at the list of filming locations on the IMDb, so many were within ten miles of where I live (Salisbury) and I have visited, that that reality is very intense. The locations are always beautifully and sympathetically portrayed and presented and indeed, many are quite modest, compared to other adaptations, which is all for the better. This film has been on TV quite a few times and will always be, it's an evergreen classic, a rare thing in that both critics and public adore it equally. I actually bought the DVD, in a box-set along with 'Pride & Prejudice' and 'Atonement', both directed by Joe Wright. If someone told me that I'd be buying films about foppy people in floppy bonnets ten years ago, I'd just have looked them blankly in the face....

    Incredibly enjoyable movie with vivid characters. It was really cool to see a cast of so many people who became so famous later on. Kate winslet is gorgeous and plays the passionate sister to a t. Emma Thompson's face and whole demeanor make her perfectly suited to her role as well. When i saw Hugh Laurie from House i was like What! There he is! Mr Sarcastic Dr. House! Even Professor Snape from Harry Potter has an important part (Alan Rickman)and i love his unique voice most of all, though he is a fine actor as well. Finally, I really enjoyed Hugh Grant's stiff, humble walk and speech. What a charismatic actor.

    The movie is so long (about 130 minutes). But it didn't made me feel bore. Because what Ang Lee did with directory and Emma did with Screenplay is superb. So magical on what Emma translated the word in Jane Austen's novel to her Screenplay. The Movie is so charming, especially with hugh grant in it. Although he is still 'Hugh Grant', but the quirkiness inside Hugh's personality made him a likable leading male. For Kate Winslet, it safe to say that she is is a scene stealer in this movie. Emma Thompson is great in front of the camera. And it is so refreshing to see Alan Rickman taking a role as a nice englishman with a charm. Ang Lee + Emma's screenplay + top notch acting = 'must see' movie/'must own the DVD' movie.

    Before The tigers crouched and the dragons hid, before the boys of mountain Brokeback, there was Ang Lee's masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, that invites everyone's attention for. It is probably the best adaptation of Sense and Sensibility (Jane Austen's novel) you will ever see, with stellar performances by Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, all who give award worthy emotions throughout the film. I found "Sense and Sensibilty" to be one of the most charming movies with a warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, many of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best as per my perception. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay. Sense and Sensibility stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as sisters, who are left poor after their rich father dies and leaves all his wealth to his son from his earlier marriage, making both the sisters poison for their future husbands because of the lack of their ability to offer dowry. This doesn't stop them from love, however, which causes many problems and heart breaks. Thompson is the 'sensible one as She is reserved and nurturing, while Winslet is the overtly passionate and artistic one. Their acting, as well as the excellent supporting cast's performances are wonderful and believable. However, the real star of the movie is the direction The incredible landscapes and the beautiful cinematography is a character in itself. In one particular scene, Winslet is taking a walk after hearing some unfortunate news, and the very atmosphere around her envelops her and makes the scene so much more fulfilling. Ang Lee is a brilliant artist, and has shown such amazing versatility with his portfolio of work that anytime I hear that a new Lee film is going to be released, I go crazy. MY RATING: 8/10

    OK, it's not Pride and Prejudice, but still such a lovely, evocative film. Makes one painfully aware of the old law of primogeniture and the financial difficulties it incurred. Besides the incomparable Emma Thompson, so many other great actors completed their roles to perfection Long before she was known as the survivor on Titanic, Kate Winslet made a lovely contribution into a heady company and held her own beautifully. As well the young actress who portrayed Margaret Dashwood, offered some nice comedy relief and smiles. And he small, role played by Hugh Laurie is so fun. And he comes to the rescue when Marianne falls ill. Such a bizarre thing to see they were still 'bleeding' patients. How very bizarre against modern medicine. There are so many unsung heroes in this movie, not the least of which is Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, and even the actor who portrays Willouby. That actor later married Emma Thompson, so he must be the right sort. Watch it for the lovely, largely accurate portrayal of the times. As in all these movies, I think 'thank goodness' the bows and curtsey's are a thing of the past. A lovely, lovely movie, is you like this sort of thing.

    I think this is one of the most well-made beautiful movies I've ever seen. It makes me cry every time I see it. The romance, the scenery, the music - it tears at my heart. The romantic part of it is so enduring, as is everything else about it. I've seen it about 10 times and I'm sure I will watch it many more times. The characters are all, in my opinion, well played. The acting is superb. The more I see it, the more I love it. I love it much better than the book. It's makes me yearn to step back into 19th century England. I have not seen a movie this good in many years. Thank you everyone who was involved for making this wonderful movie. I just love it.

    "Sense And Sensibility" is a film by the master Ang Lee from the novel by Jane Austen. The script is written by the original point of view of Emma Thompson who also plays Elinor Dashwood. The film centers about two sisters who are completely different. The elder,Elinor(Emma Thompson) is wise ,prudent,practical and taciturn in regards of her own feelings. The younger,Marianne(Kate Winslet)is passionate,fantasist absolutist in her ideas and she can't absolutely hide her emotions.After Mr.Dashwood death their marriage opportunities are definitely damaged. The point is how could Elinor and Marianne overgrow their own lack of balance in their attitude towards love? The direction is spectacular and poetical and Ang Lee is able to film really overwhelming sequences. It has to be said that sometimes costume dramas are only a chance to built extraordinary film sets with nothing particularly original interpretations but "Sense and Sensibility" is quite the opposite. It is faithful to the original source but it is nonetheless an important showcase of a not ordinary direction and truly inspired and brilliant performances. The acting is absolutely superb in every way. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are truly in command of their characters and express every single beat with great accomplishment. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. This coupled with a really lovely soundtrack makes this film particularly beautiful. My vote is 8/10.

    n extremely spot-on movie, it deserves to be up there with Airplane! and The Naked Gun in the best 'stupid-funny' films of all time. If you read the blurb on the back of the box you will probably not go any further. But give it a go - it's a real heart warming laugh out loud film. The film ended up being a little sillier than I would have liked, particularly in terms of the relationship between Larry and Iris, and putting Steve Lawrence in your film is never a good thing (although we should all be thankful Edie wasn't with him), but Sense and Sensibility is certainly a powerfu TV movie that should resonate with everyone who has ever been lonely (and I think that's just about every one of us). I am amazed at how many people have never heard of this film, let alone seen it. Go watch it now - I guarantee you'll be quoting it for months.

    I've long resisted period drama, citing it as nostalgic pomp for elderly ladies and as all the so called classics, involved gooey and rather non- sensical 'romance', that made them even more boring. Middle age, naturally, started to change that plus a greater understanding and respect for the genre. It IS largely about the only thing that British film-makers can reliably do well, right? Except, of course, Taiwanese master-director Ang Lee got hold of this one, serenely pumping it with majesty, poise and prose. Not a second of running time is wasted, the pacing is perfect, every frame counts. The casting, some of which on their own and in average quality films can be awful (Hugh Grant, for instance), along with Emma Thompson's simple but eloquent Oscar winning script, turn these bit actors into very good ones. Those who are reading this and other reviews will surely know the story of Mr Darcy and co., probably much better than I do, so I'm not going there. One of my all-time favourites, Kate Winslett, is superb, of course, radiating both naivety and female knowing, often at the same time. Emma Thompson, here as her older sister Elinor Dashwood, is usually someone - or usually plays people - that I don't like much - but here she is totally natural and convincing. Looking at the list of filming locations on the IMDb, so many were within ten miles of where I live (Salisbury) and I have visited, that that reality is very intense. The locations are always beautifully and sympathetically portrayed and presented and indeed, many are quite modest, compared to other adaptations, which is all for the better. This film has been on TV quite a few times and will always be, it's an evergreen classic, a rare thing in that both critics and public adore it equally. I actually bought the DVD, in a box-set along with 'Pride & Prejudice' and 'Atonement', both directed by Joe Wright. If someone told me that I'd be buying films about foppy people in floppy bonnets ten years ago, I'd just have looked them blankly in the face....

    Incredibly enjoyable movie with vivid characters. It was really cool to see a cast of so many people who became so famous later on. Kate winslet is gorgeous and plays the passionate sister to a t. Emma Thompson's face and whole demeanor make her perfectly suited to her role as well. When i saw Hugh Laurie from House i was like What! There he is! Mr Sarcastic Dr. House! Even Professor Snape from Harry Potter has an important part (Alan Rickman)and i love his unique voice most of all, though he is a fine actor as well. Finally, I really enjoyed Hugh Grant's stiff, humble walk and speech. What a charismatic actor.

    The movie is so long (about 130 minutes). But it didn't made me feel bore. Because what Ang Lee did with directory and Emma did with Screenplay is superb. So magical on what Emma translated the word in Jane Austen's novel to her Screenplay. The Movie is so charming, especially with hugh grant in it. Although he is still 'Hugh Grant', but the quirkiness inside Hugh's personality made him a likable leading male. For Kate Winslet, it safe to say that she is is a scene stealer in this movie. Emma Thompson is great in front of the camera. And it is so refreshing to see Alan Rickman taking a role as a nice englishman with a charm. Ang Lee + Emma's screenplay + top notch acting = 'must see' movie/'must own the DVD' movie.

    Before The tigers crouched and the dragons hid, before the boys of mountain Brokeback, there was Ang Lee's masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, that invites everyone's attention for. It is probably the best adaptation of Sense and Sensibility (Jane Austen's novel) you will ever see, with stellar performances by Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, all who give award worthy emotions throughout the film. I found "Sense and Sensibilty" to be one of the most charming movies with a warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, many of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best as per my perception. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay. Sense and Sensibility stars Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as sisters, who are left poor after their rich father dies and leaves all his wealth to his son from his earlier marriage, making both the sisters poison for their future husbands because of the lack of their ability to offer dowry. This doesn't stop them from love, however, which causes many problems and heart breaks. Thompson is the 'sensible one as She is reserved and nurturing, while Winslet is the overtly passionate and artistic one. Their acting, as well as the excellent supporting cast's performances are wonderful and believable. However, the real star of the movie is the direction The incredible landscapes and the beautiful cinematography is a character in itself. In one particular scene, Winslet is taking a walk after hearing some unfortunate news, and the very atmosphere around her envelops her and makes the scene so much more fulfilling. Ang Lee is a brilliant artist, and has shown such amazing versatility with his portfolio of work that anytime I hear that a new Lee film is going to be released, I go crazy. MY RATING: 8/10

    OK, it's not Pride and Prejudice, but still such a lovely, evocative film. Makes one painfully aware of the old law of primogeniture and the financial difficulties it incurred. Besides the incomparable Emma Thompson, so many other great actors completed their roles to perfection Long before she was known as the survivor on Titanic, Kate Winslet made a lovely contribution into a heady company and held her own beautifully. As well the young actress who portrayed Margaret Dashwood, offered some nice comedy relief and smiles. And he small, role played by Hugh Laurie is so fun. And he comes to the rescue when Marianne falls ill. Such a bizarre thing to see they were still 'bleeding' patients. How very bizarre against modern medicine. There are so many unsung heroes in this movie, not the least of which is Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, and even the actor who portrays Willouby. That actor later married Emma Thompson, so he must be the right sort. Watch it for the lovely, largely accurate portrayal of the times. As in all these movies, I think 'thank goodness' the bows and curtsey's are a thing of the past. A lovely, lovely movie, is you like this sort of thing.

    I think this is one of the most well-made beautiful movies I've ever seen. It makes me cry every time I see it. The romance, the scenery, the music - it tears at my heart. The romantic part of it is so enduring, as is everything else about it. I've seen it about 10 times and I'm sure I will watch it many more times. The characters are all, in my opinion, well played. The acting is superb. The more I see it, the more I love it. I love it much better than the book. It's makes me yearn to step back into 19th century England. I have not seen a movie this good in many years. Thank you everyone who was involved for making this wonderful movie. I just love it.

    I've seriously never seen a film based on any Jane Austen novel, and I've never read an Austen novel. It's just not the type of novel that would really intrigue me all that much. But this film, for what it was, was pretty good. I definitely saw it so I could see I had see Ang Lee's "Big Four", after loving Life of Pi and Brokeback Mountain. It's nowhere near as great as those, but the acting, especially by Thompson and Winslet, is really great. I think the end is a all way too tidy, and I heard there are quite a few changes in many of the characterizations between this and the novel, but for what it is, it's pretty good and definitely something to admire.

    Sense and Sensibility is another great work from Ang Lee. He is director who can work in any genre and add a lot to great story. His fantastic ability to tell stories and bring out heartfelt and very human performances is just amazing. Like any other film by Ang Lee, Sense and Sensibility is slowly paced, beautifully shot and features a fantastic score. He knows where to put the camera and his films always benefit from beautiful cinematography. By far the strongest element of the film is the script by Emma Thompson. She manages to balance the wit and sophistication with powerful drama and great sense of humor. The dialog was fantastic and the direction perfectly complimented the material. The performances in Sense and Sensibility were great. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet was an absolute joy to watch. They gave this film an energy and true emotion that is lacking in most of current day actresses. But by far my favorite was Alan Rickman. It was very nice to see him playing a very nice and honorable person for a change. Close second was Hugh Laurie, you see him, you'll understand. But it was all around a very strong cast without any weak links. There really isn't much flaws to be found in Sense and Sensibility that would bother me. Yes it's kinda slow, but so are nearly every film by Ang Lee. And I really appreciate films that can take there time. In other words Sense and Sensibility is a must see for anyone who wish to see a smart, funny and very touching period romance. It has a fantastic cast, great script and steady direction by Ang Lee. It's a chick flick worth seeing.
