    Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see. This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.

    Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM. But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

    I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck. There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story". All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again! As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making. About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing. Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.

    This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair. One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10

    Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion. It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks. And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role. My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

    This is a Christmas movie above all, you should know this much going in. What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility. So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness. But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera. There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

    None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly clich&eacute;, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII: Next year all our troubles will be miles away, Someday soon, we all will be together If the Fates allow What does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943. Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

    I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck. There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story". All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again! As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making. About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing. Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.

    This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair. One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10

    Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion. It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks. And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role. My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

    This is a Christmas movie above all, you should know this much going in. What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility. So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness. But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera. There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

    None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly clich&eacute;, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII: Next year all our troubles will be miles away, Someday soon, we all will be together If the Fates allow What does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943. Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

    Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see. This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.

    Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM. But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks. And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role. My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

    This is a Christmas movie above all, you should know this much going in. What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility. So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness. But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera. There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

    None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly clich&eacute;, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII: Next year all our troubles will be miles away, Someday soon, we all will be together If the Fates allow What does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943. Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

    Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see. This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.

    Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM. But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

    I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck. There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story". All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again! As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making. About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing. Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.

    This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair. One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10

    Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion. It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters.

My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

    None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly clich&eacute;, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII: Next year all our troubles will be miles away, Someday soon, we all will be together If the Fates allow What does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943. Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

    Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see. This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.

    Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM. But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

    I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck. There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story". All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again! As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making. About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing. Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.

    This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair. One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10

    Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion. It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks. And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role. My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

    This is a Christmas movie above all, you should know this much going in. What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility. So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness. But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera. There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

    Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see. This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.

    Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM. But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

    I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck. There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story". All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again! As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making. About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing. Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.

    This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair. One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10

    Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion. It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks. And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role. My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

    This is a Christmas movie above all, you should know this much going in. What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility. So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness. But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera. There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

    None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly clich&eacute;, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII: Next year all our troubles will be miles away, Someday soon, we all will be together If the Fates allow What does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943. Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

    I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck. There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story". All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again! As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making. About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing. Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.

    This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair. One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10

    Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion. It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks. And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role. My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

    This is a Christmas movie above all, you should know this much going in. What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility. So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness. But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera. There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

    None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly clich&eacute;, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII: Next year all our troubles will be miles away, Someday soon, we all will be together If the Fates allow What does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943. Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

    Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see. This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.

    Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM. But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

    Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion. It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks. And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role. My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

    This is a Christmas movie above all, you should know this much going in. What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility. So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness. But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera. There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

    None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly clich&eacute;, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII: Next year all our troubles will be miles away, Someday soon, we all will be together If the Fates allow What does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943. Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

    Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see. This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.

    Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM. But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

    I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck. There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story". All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again! As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making. About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing. Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.

    This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair. One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

What this has come to mean, from Carol onwards, is a vivacious sketch of a dreamy but coherent world at the outset, here a picture of a prosperous white-picket-fence America, literally a picture that is animated as we submerge inside the fairy-tale, with clear demarcations between moral good and bad, with a clear complexion, but whose coherence we know will be tried, teased, or tempted over the course of the film by some hint of darkness that progressively threatens to overwhelm. Eventually it is going to prevail, the tribulation only strengthening bonds that affirm the value of family, integrity, selflessness, humility. So if it's a Christmas movie you are looking for, to warm and comfort you, a fictional fireplace to snuggle next to, this can satisfy. The final image is of radiant faces embracing next to a Christmas tree. It beams joy and happiness. But as a musical, it is tepid stuff. The test of a good musical, any movie for that matter but in the musical so much more clearly, is how well the voluptuous expression of song and dance, an expression of some purity and soul, is integrated inside the larger world that gives rise to them. How deep they map internally, visually, addressing the circumstances that inspire that dance. How in turn we are engaged to dance with the camera. There is none of that here. No effort to integrate, no imagination to map to. Characters simply burst into song, poor song, poorly choreographed. There is no design of the heart beating faster.

    None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line, but few people notice because there is no story line, no plot. Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life, circa 1903-04, some cute, some quaint, but mostly clich&eacute;, and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it, Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs, especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music, and what have you? A movie without a plot, a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely; it is not Garland in 1903, it is Garland talking about WWII: Next year all our troubles will be miles away, Someday soon, we all will be together If the Fates allow What does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943. Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10; with it, a 5. It is highly over-rated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten, yet has a lot of polish and fine detail, and a story line of eternal appeal, in short, a classic, so it is highly under-rated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists, though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun, in a brainless sort of way. By all means, see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

    Really? This is what I was waiting for? This film is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together with some macabre elements. I thought it would be a postcard to St. Louis, but it could have taken place anywhere. The World's Fair was barely relevant. The men were all stereotypes; the lordly-yet-foolish money-focused father who is changed by his family's warmth. The awkwardly formal men, the candied turn-of-the-century nostalgia. Other than Judy Garland's desire to extract a kiss out of her neighbor, the whole film is a silly tribute to normative culture. I guess that's what they hoped the boys fighting in Europe and Asia in 1944 wanted to see. This whole Ivy League worship was nauseating. "I'm talking to a Yale man in New York!" "Princeton is a peach of a school!" ...and the safe "Smith"-like names. The father wanting to move to NY for "money" even though they look pretty damn well off. The oldest sister's beau bursting into their house angrily and demanding that she marry him and he won't take no for an answer or whatever. Then walking out. A masturbatory fantasy for one-dimensional women. The only interesting point was the little sister's mischievousness. It was dark and playful part of an otherwise pointless costume drama.

    Amid the many superior musicals produced by MGM, few were as well-executed and charming as this one. I say that not having seen the film since the old days of black and white television, when I wasn't very impressed. Finally now, in 2012, I am watching it again and wow...what I missed all of these years! In terms of production, Vincente Minnelli did a marvelous job here...not to mention meeting Judy Garland and eventually marrying her. The Technicolor here is truly stunning, although there is some unevenness in the current print shown on TCM. But best of all is a tremendous cast. Perhaps the only time Judy Garland was better was in "The Wizard Of Oz", five years earlier...and I say that as no particular fan of Ms. Garland. Margaret O'Brien, only 7 years old, turns in a remarkable performance. I didn't recognize Mary Astor as the mother; a very different role for her, and well done. Lucille Bremer and Tom Drake do nicely; I never understood why Drake wasn't more successful. I always got a kick out of Marjorie Main until the Ma & Pa Kettle movies, and here she is great as the maid. Leon Ames has a more substantial role here as the father, and does very nicely. Harry Davenport -- always a treat to watch -- plays the grandfather. And June Lockhart is here, also. There is one issue that may be a bit of a downer for some viewers. If you are heavy into plots, you'll be disappointed. There really is no plot to the film. Rather, it's a series of vignettes showing a small child (O'Brien) and a late teen (Garland) growing up. And it's done so nicely, you're likely to excuse the lack of a plot. And then there are the songs, particularly "The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". I rarely give an "8", but here's one!

    I saw this film on my mother's recommendation, and my mother's recommendations are usually quite good. Not this time. Feh! This was a lousy movie. Allow me to proudly stand with the elite minority who see this film as dreck. There's so much wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The plot, if you can even call it that, is so paper thin and obvious as to be a joke. The *instant* that the father announces the move to New York, it is transparent exactly what's going to happen with that. I'm not one to try to out-think a movie while I'm watching it, I seldom pre-figure-out what's going to happen. But in this case, before the father was even done explaining the move, it was painfully obvious that the family would get all weepy about it and eventually he would relent. It was hardly even worth the trouble of going through the motions of carrying out that bit of "story". All the machinations with the two sisters' romances are ridiculous, because these women are *so* concerned about winning the affections of these absolute *nothings*. I mean the male romantic objects are so bland, lifeless, ordinary, it's absolutely impossible to see what these women see in them. One of them has so little function in the movie he's more of a prop than a character. The other is, frankly, a wuss. That may be the worse romance, because Judy Garland's character is clearly made out to be the belle of the ball, who can get pretty much any man around that she wants. And yet all she wants is that nebish next door. Feh, and feh again! As a musical, I didn't find it particularly strong. For the most part, I found the songs ordinary and unmemorable. The title song is OK, I guess, if rather insipid. The only song I really liked was the rather famous one about the trolley, and even that one failed to score a bullseye, as I found it extremely odd to discover how much the lyrics of the song fail to line up with what's actually going on in the movie at the time. It comes off as rather slap- dash film-making. About the only place I can bestow praise is upon the performance of Margaret O'Brien. She certainly does a good job with the role she has, even if that role is a little disturbing. Even the movie's denouement comes off as weak. After all that build up and brouhaha about the amazing world's fair, when they actually get to it, it's pretty anticlimactic. We don't get to see much of anything so wonderful about the fair, yet we see the characters reacting with absolute rapture.

    This simple and charming musical centers around the life of the Smith family of St. Louis, in 1903-1904. There are the parents, 4 daughters, 1 son, the grandfather, and the family maid (hilariously played by Marjorie Main). We watch the Smith family throughout their adventures: the two eldest daughters have romances, and the youngest two go through childhood traditions such as Halloween. But then, the father gets a job in New York, which threatens the family's peaceful existence in St. Louis. Fortunately, everything turns out for the better, and the family heads out to the World's Fair. One interesting point to this film is that the plot is relatively simple. This allows for multiple opportunities for the family to be developed. This film had multiple problems in its production: multiple scripts with rather silly plot points, and the majority of the cast took sick at one point or another. The fact that this film turned out as well as it did is a miracle, for none of the problems showed up on screen. What makes the film work is the relationship between the family members. Everyone looks like they could have been a real family at one point, thanks to Vincente Minnelli's superb direction. Although all the performances are excellent, the two standouts are the adorable Margaret O'Brien and the one and only Judy Garland. O'Brien naturally steals every scene, and Garland proves why she was (and still is) the beloved performer she is today, with that marvelous voice and expressive face. Another standout to the production is George Folsey's warm Technicolor cinematography, which captures the lushness of the sets and Irene Sharaff's costumes (Minnelli films depend on their visuals). Let's not forget those songs, which make this film the classic it is today ("The Trolley Song" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," among others). Quaint and simple fun. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10

    Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion. It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but on screen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.

    Another classic musical from the MGMs golden age, starring the immensely talented Judy Garland (it's a good job she is multi-talented too, because a lesser star would have had the show stolen from right under her nose by Margaret O'Brien as adorable Little Tootie). This isn't strictly a Christmas film, but it does feature Judy singing 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', so it almost counts! Set in 1904, the Smith family live in St Louis and are excited about the yearly St Louis World's Fair. Judy plays Esther, the second eldest daughter and one of five children. The aforementioned 7 year old Margaret O'Brien is youngest child Tootie, and anyone who thinks that children can't be exceptional actors should see this film! While eldest daughter Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes for a proposal from her boyfriend Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), Esther falls in love with the family's new neighbour John Truitt. The family's happiness is threatened when their father (Leon Ames) announces the he has been given a job in New York, and the family will have to move there. There are some superb songs  the title track, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Skip To My Lou and The Trolley Song, to name a few  and there is lots of colour, romance and humour. This isn't my favourite Judy Garland film  I think the lesser known films The Harvey Girls and The Pirate are both better movies  but it is hugely enjoyable and bound to make the viewer feel good. Judy looks beautiful, and there is not a weak link among the cast. And it made me want to visit St Louis! Recommended for all fans of great musicals.

    Often I'll approach a revisit by addressing my previous complaints and see if my score needs an upgrade (or downgrade). Going back to my old review, one of the first remarks is "the plot is pure fluff". I didn't phrase it as a negative, but it bears looking into anyway. No, there isn't a whole lot of dramatic conflict in the film (the threatened move to New York doesn't occur until more than halfway through) but I don't think that matters. Being based on a series of short autobiographical memoirs, the story naturally has a loose, slices-of-life structure. I guess it is fluff in the sense that it's basically a nostalgia buffet with a thoroughly idealized family, but there is plot there. It's just divided into small chunks. And that leads to another of my prior nitpicks: the Halloween episode. It's jarring because it seems to come out of nowhere and is focused on a seemingly minor character. This time around I found it utterly charming. Tootie is kind of annoying at times, but not during this part. Margaret O'Brien is even quite good in the role. My main beef was that there weren't enough songs. In the 50+ minutes between "Trolley Song" (pure, exuberant joy) and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (so gorgeously sorrowful I had to watch it twice) there's only "You and I" to break it up. Now, that's a lovely little tune, but that's a long period with only one song for a musical. But you know, I didn't mind it so much. The songs are magnificent, but there's enough of them in the first half. I enjoy the characters so much that it's okay that the second half isn't much of a musical, focusing more on the wonderful interactions in this family. Terrific performances all around, especially Garland, Bremer and Astor. I still don't feel quite right bumping this up to "Masterpiece" status, but it's definitely a film I enjoy immensely, and brings some tears to my eyes. Zing zing zing went my heartstrings.

It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story, you should watch the 1949 Little Women, which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father, 1947. Or I Remember Mama, 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semi-autobiographical stories of family life, far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy. And for a musical on a similar family theme, see the 1945 State Fair (not to be confused with the 1963 remake). The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive, though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis, which will warm your heart. Spoiler alert: In the last two minutes, the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat, and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.

    Meet Me in St. Louis is a movie of bits and pieces which never quite all come together properly. The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine. The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should. It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.
