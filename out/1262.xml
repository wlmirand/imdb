    Nicole Holofcener has a distinct eye for everyday events. 'Walking and Talking' is the first slice of life film from the same director who's made gems like 'Friends With Money', 'Lovely and Amazing' and 'Please Give'. All films mainly focus on the relationships of women. The center of 'Walking and Talking' is the friendship between Amelia and Laura. Holofcener and her actors Catherine Keener (a regular in the director's films) and Anne Heche do a superb job in depicting a friendship that is not always about hanging out and partying. What Holofcener portrays is a bond that has changed throughout the years for these two women but become stronger than before. They are open to each other, honest, judgmental without worrying about hurting each other. Feelings do get hurt but at the same time it is this honesty that is the strength of their relationship and what gets them through the tougher times. The director has cast Catherine Keener in all her feature films and has done so in distinct roles. In all these films, Keener's character is searching for satisfaction whether it's in marriage, friendship, human nature. The characters, though similar in many ways, also have distinct qualities especially in the way they cope with their problems and the people surrounding them. Of course, needless to say, Keener fits all roles to the T, turning in some of her best works. Anne Heche definitely holds her own. Liev Schreiber is adequate. Kevin Corrigan is great. Todd Field does a fine job too. On the technical side, it's nothing too flashy. Everything flows smoothly. The score gives it the right level of whimsical touch. The locations are beautiful yet simple. In the end, 'Walking and Talking' is a universal human story about friendship. Holofcener did a terrific job telling such a story in her first film and she has continued to do so in her following features.

    This is a pleasant slice-of-life comedy about two young women experiencing love and heartache. This was the first feature film for writer-director Holofcener, and she has made a career out of such small films about relationships, particularly among women, all starring Keener. The actress is so good at this sort of role that she doesn't even appear to be acting. Heche is equally good as Keener's best friend, engaged to be married to goofy Schreiber. It's not a great film by any means, but the characters are real and likable, making it easy to spend some time with them. Holofcener has a talent for making keen observations about human behavior.

    Walking And Talking is a lot more talking than walking. It's the sort of film that some will think is the cat's meow while others will despise it like it's a child molester and both points of view will be valid. That's because while this movie is well done, what it does is so blisteringly ordinary. Just about anyone who watches it will have moments of emotional recognition for what's going on in the story and most will spend the time in between those moments plaintively waiting for the talking and walking to go anywhere. Amelia (Catherine Keener) is a single woman in New York City. She has a lifelong best friend named Laura (Anne Heche) who's now living with a boyfriend (Todd Field). Amelia doesn't have a boyfriend. She does have an ex-boyfriend named Andrew (Liev Schrieber) who hangs around like Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld. Amelia's also got a cat dying of cancer and a video store clerk/horror movie fan (Kevin Corrigan) who wants to bone her. As soon as Laura's boyfriend proposes to her, she starts fancying other men. As soon as Amelia gets comfortable with "settling" for the video store clerk, he dumps her for saying he's ugly behind his back. Andrew has a father with Alzheimer's and a pseudo-girlfriend in California whom he wants to dump right after he has phone sex with her. Amelia feels abandoned by Laura not always being there for her and Laura can't always be there for her because she's actually gone out and gotten a life of her own. Now take all of that and coat it with 2 &frac12; inches of well written but mostly inconsequential blather and you've got Walking And Talking. It'll work for you if you like the performers, enjoy having a waterfall of very short scenes splash over you and appreciate examinations of humanity in utterly unexceptional circumstances. It'll feel like a potato peeler across your forehead if you want characters that are likable, need a story to have some propulsion and don't want to watch a motion picture that's less interesting than your own life. Catherine Keener does a wonderful job playing a woman you really wouldn't want to know. Anne Hech is as good playing a woman you would want to know but would have a love/hate relationship with. Liev Schreiber is okay, except for the fact that Amelia and Andrew's relationship is written as though Nicole Holofcener has never met a man, let alone dated one. Ex-lovers can certainly break up and still find a way to be friends. That way is not going to be like it is here, where Amelia treats Andrew like her gay best friend and Andrew behaves like he's her gay best friend. That's an odd way for ex-lovers to relate and requires a lot more explanation than it gets in Walking And Talking. Which is a complaint that could be levied against much of this script. While the film is already too long as 86 minutes, the story feels like significant parts of it are regularly being skipped in order to show you scenes that would normally be cut out of a film to tighten it up. None of it's bad, but you can't help thinking there's something more important you should be seeing. If you like dramas where the drama is muted, comedies where the comedy produces more knowing grins than giggles and romances where you don't particularly care if the lovers get together or not, give Walking And Talking a try. If you can take pleasure from craft for its own sake, give Walking And Talking a try. If you want a movie that doesn't remind you of the inane conversations you've had with your own friends, find something else to watch

    Even in her first film back in 1996, Nicole Holocenfer has always been the best at conveying so much feeling, with so little. 'Walking and Talking' is an impressive Nicole Holocenfer starter and possibly her best as it gets everything just right in that Nicole Holofcener way. It doesn't over due with the bonding motives drenched in the appropriate music that Nicole Holocenfer can't see the cheese in and has induced in her more recent films immensely. This first effort also spawns Nicole's signature comedy of finding the hilarity in smug, annoying and odd strangers(who we all loathe), and in the funny but horrible shallowness of her characters in which has made Nicole known for making comedic movies since then. The writing here is more raw and youthful with Nicole's feelings as a girl and a woman, maybe because of the times but this makes for more original, interesting, and entertaining dialogue and performances.'Walking and Talking' unlike Nicole's later films, also doesn't hit you over the head with the acts of one dimensional characters as each character properly goes through a vary of feelings and moods as they each go through various different situations of life, more so like real people. With this, (unfortuantely unlike her other films) she doesn't make the men in the movie side notes and props. They get a say too and convey almost as much emotion as the female characters. Nicole Holofcener's point in her movies maybe to make women the forefront of her movies and to make men the props, but I personally find it insulting and typical to do this, so it was perfect to see her first effort was true to everyone. Nicole's direction style, especially with this entire, tells us shes not afraid to make things wacky to convey a character's thoughts and emotions even in a story of real-life, and with her camera direction as well, she always makes things feel interesting to watch as characters appear on the screen and as scenes coming along with a simple pan, although things going on in the movie are average life situations. And she never pushes a scene into a more sexually or exciting realm for interest of the viewer, as she keeps scenes in the reality of what it is depicting, which is wonderful because its real. She proves to be a big fan of the fade in and fade out into and out of sequences as its used here and in her later films, but it makes more sense in 'Walking and Talking'and brings certain meaning to certain scenes as appose to 'Friends with Money' but the fade out was interesting in that movie none-the-less. This direction style with the soft, awkward acoustic music to the scenes can be also seen as influential to the indie movie scene of 2000s with it's structure, to movies like 'Juno'. This is a great 90's time capsule and even unrated as a definitive 90's movie with it's great 90's soundtrack and band references, it's geek-tom fan fair, and laid-back lifestyles of the characters so significant to generation x. This first effort years ago, shows that Nicole Holofcener gets like no other the awkwardness of relating to ageing family members and ageing in general. The feeling of being lonely, and feeling that time is passing by and being wasted having your own ironic stupid superficial ideals hold you back from being with someone who wants to fill the void and who thinks your the bell-of-the-ball, and that you don't know someone can make you happy until you give them a shot, because you can't wait forever. This is also one of the most accurate films showing the jealously shared between to friends, of one having someone in companionship, and the other having no one in freedom. This is an important,intelligent and accurate film for females but at it's core its also a life study for men and women equally. May I also add, that no wonder Nicole Holofcener has used Catherine Keener all these years.... Shes a great actress. And This is proof that Kevin Corrigan has always been amazing.

    Catherine Keener (as Amelia) spends the opening scenes putting down everyone in her life. She doesn't like best friend Anne Heche (as Laura)'s engagement ring. She calls video store geek Kevin Corrigan (as Bill), who wants to date her, "The Ugly Guy". She repeatedly calls ex-boyfriend-turned-friend Liev Schreiber (as Andrew) an ass----, for enjoying telephone sex. Her cat has cancer. And, her kitchen sponge stinks. Intriguing character study, from writer/director Nicole Holofcener. Ms. Keener's "Amelia" seems to have a lot going for her; she is funny and attractive, and, she manages to keep friendships while being excessively judgmental. Things may have started going wrong for her when roommate Heche moved in with boyfriend Todd Field (as Frank). Mr. Field becomes another supportive friend, however. Although Keener is cranky throughout, she eventually proves to be an interesting, supportive friend. The performances are all terrific. Mr. Corrigan may be most memorable, as the horror movie geek Keener labels "The Ugly Guy"; watch for an outstanding scene as he overhears a message on Keener telephone answering machine. Some back-hair might have helped him look more ugly, though. Then, again, hairier Rafael Alvarez does seem prove excessive hair isn't so ugly. Wonderfully ironic to see Randall Batinkoff (as Peter) play a waiter so well, and an actor so poorly. "Walking and Talking" manages to be a story about meaningful friendship without being terribly meaningful. ****** Walking and Talking (1996) Nicole Holofcener ~ Catherine Keener, Anne Heche, Kevin Corrigan

    Amelia (Catherine Keener) is a very needy person. Therefore, losing her childhood friend Laura (Anne Heche) as a roommate has been tough. Laura has moved in with her boyfriend and is on the verge of becoming engaged. That hurts, as Amelia has not had good luck with men. She is forever phoning her best friend, nevertheless, for advice and for support in coping with life's problems, from a sick cat to a former boyfriend/pornography addict (Liev Schreiber). Laura, a counselor, does her best to be available for Amelia, but wedding plans and minor tifts with her intended leave her with less free time than ever. Will Amelia learn to just stand on her own two feet, for goodness sake? This is a quietly thoughtful film about friendship and its boundaries. Keener is wonderful as the friend who relies on others to help her through life's ups and downs. Even the most cherished friendships need room to breathe and Amelia has to learn this the hard way. Heche is likewise very fine as the beautiful lady who appears to have it all but may, in fact, have some flaws, too. Todd Field is great as Laura's fianc&eacute; and Schrieber gives a nice turn as a commitment phobic, sexually obsessive addict. All of the production necessities, from costumes to sets to direction, are quite nice. Then, too, the script is quirky, funny and original as well. No, this is not a thrill-a-minute adventure, so those who eschew slower paced, dialogue-driven films will want to skip over this one. Yet, if you adore romantic dramas brimming with life, humor, and important statements, here is the film you've been looking for. Walk to the nearest video outlet and peruse the shelves until you grasp this little gem in your hands.

    Terrific acting from a terrific cast, hilarious and clever dialog within a top script. Never a dull moment. The film avoids sliding from comedy into tedious sentimentality, and this is due to the fact that it's an independent film and not one of those Hollywood formula comedies that run out of jokes halfway, then hide behind clich&eacute;d boo-hoo-hoo crap. Only the last few minutes get a little schmaltzy, but not in any sort of irritating way. The film is more down-to-Earth than some other films of this kind; it avoids pretentiousness creeping into the dialog - the script's aim being to be humorous and not preachy. The only pity is that the film is rather short. Many funny scenes, a lot of which stem from a very original approach to humour; the biopsied-mole-gift "incident", Corrigan laughing about a cat having cancer, a patient who lies about his problems just to be interesting to Heche, Keener renting out pornos for her ex-boyfriend, Keener refusing to "finance" her ex-boyfriend's high long-distance sex-on-the-phone phone bills, Keener getting upset at Schreiber after he honestly answers her question about why they split up, Heche complaining to her fianc&eacute;e that their sex-life is getting predictable (+ a detailed description of why it's so), Keener refusing to even consider the idea of an "execution of my cat" (very funny wording), or - one of my favourite moments - Heche's fianc&eacute; referring to hers and Keener's music as "vagina music" (i.e. the sort of 90s American-generation-X-girl-on-guitar, acoustic plinka-plonka, trite, oh-so "deep", and utterly uninspired and dull radio crap, practiced by such "talents" as Heather Nova, Lisa Loeb, Jewel, and the like).

    Amelia has what everyone thinks they need, a job, a apartment, a cat, a best friend, a date (even though hes ugly) and she is even close friends with her ex. But then, things start slid to fast from under her feet, her cat gets cancer, her best friend, Laura, is getting married, and Bill(her ugly date), hasn't talked to her in two weeks.. All this time, she keeps up the appearance, while helping Laura pick out a place for the wedding, giving Andrew advice about his relationship with a girl in California, treating her cats cancer, and trying to win over Bill. this is one of those films that everyone (apart from small children) can have something in common. whether they have commitment issues, as Laura has with Frank , or you still like your ex, like Andrew does Amelia, or you feel like the third wheel, just like Amelia does with Laura, or you feel very distant from your partner, as Frank does with Laura. we all connect one of these characters to ourselves or someone we know. Everyone feels like Frank sometimes, walking on eggshells, not having any say in anything anymore. Everyone feels like Laura sometimes, like everything is going to fast, and you want to go back and enjoy life as it was before. Everyone feels like Andrew sometimes, we get so close to getting back with an ex, and being rejected nicely. And Everyone feels like Amelia sometimes, when nothing is going is your way, and nobody is listening.

    I stumbled upon this on Showtime cable, sitting in a hotel room in Kingston, Jam, nursing a nasty little virus and seeking some cheering up. What a lovely surprise. As another reviewer says, beautifully written, well acted, unpretentious and just very simply appealing. I'm really too old for voyages of discovery and young love but the stunning soundtrack featuring the wonderfully eloquent Billy Bragg evoked so many lovely memories for me. Curious how a cockney poet's music can work with an American romance...but it did. A real gem to watch on your own, with a partner or a good friend and, if you don't have a virus, a good glass of red wine.

    this is what audiences need to see more of. Good characterization, realistic dialog (no slap-stick cheap tricks, farce etc.) and capable actors. I have seen "Friends With Money" which was a disappointment compared to this and "Lovely and Amazing". This film succeeds because we care about the characters, Anne Heche as the therapist, trying to control her wedding, Catherine Keener as confused and disappointed single again friend. Andrew and Laura (Schreiber and Keener), Frank and Amelia,(Ann Heche and Todd Field) two couples just trying to make things work. They have to find humor in minor things. Kevin Corrigan adds humor as Keener's sometime date, who finds out he is referred to as the "ugly guy". Liev Schreiber adds a good element to the film. Keener's former boyfriend, he is there for her, even as she pursues Corrigan who works at a video store:..."Jeez look at him...I thought I could relax for once"... Keener says as she wonders why he has rejected her. This has been compared to "Sex and the City", but there really is no comparison. A one hour TV show vs. film; this film has resonance; we will remember and want to see these characters again, they are not cardboard cut-out characterizations. TV has to be more polarized, due to the medium and time limits, hence the characters are more superficial and obvious.(Could we picture Kim Catrall in this film, I don't think so). I am surprised Nicole Holfcener has not surmised this, and realized the casting mistake in "Friends with Money"; if someone has a too-TV persona, they do not necessarily translate to film. That was one of the problems with FWM. Also the performances in this film were not preceded by the personalities. Heche is believable, amusing and sympathetic. Catherine Keener is quirky, interesting and multi-layered. Liev Schreiber is funny, a good friend and we want to see more of him. Please, Ms. Holofcener, for your next film use film actors, not people who had a high "TV Q" or were married to a film celebrity for a brief period. It makes a great deal of difference, and the finished product proves this to be so. 9/10

With this, (unfortuantely unlike her other films) she doesn't make the men in the movie side notes and props. They get a say too and convey almost as much emotion as the female characters. Nicole Holofcener's point in her movies maybe to make women the forefront of her movies and to make men the props, but I personally find it insulting and typical to do this, so it was perfect to see her first effort was true to everyone. Nicole's direction style, especially with this entire, tells us shes not afraid to make things wacky to convey a character's thoughts and emotions even in a story of real-life, and with her camera direction as well, she always makes things feel interesting to watch as characters appear on the screen and as scenes coming along with a simple pan, although things going on in the movie are average life situations. And she never pushes a scene into a more sexually or exciting realm for interest of the viewer, as she keeps scenes in the reality of what it is depicting, which is wonderful because its real. She proves to be a big fan of the fade in and fade out into and out of sequences as its used here and in her later films, but it makes more sense in 'Walking and Talking'and brings certain meaning to certain scenes as appose to 'Friends with Money' but the fade out was interesting in that movie none-the-less. This direction style with the soft, awkward acoustic music to the scenes can be also seen as influential to the indie movie scene of 2000s with it's structure, to movies like 'Juno'. This is a great 90's time capsule and even unrated as a definitive 90's movie with it's great 90's soundtrack and band references, it's geek-tom fan fair, and laid-back lifestyles of the characters so significant to generation x. This first effort years ago, shows that Nicole Holofcener gets like no other the awkwardness of relating to ageing family members and ageing in general. The feeling of being lonely, and feeling that time is passing by and being wasted having your own ironic stupid superficial ideals hold you back from being with someone who wants to fill the void and who thinks your the bell-of-the-ball, and that you don't know someone can make you happy until you give them a shot, because you can't wait forever. This is also one of the most accurate films showing the jealously shared between to friends, of one having someone in companionship, and the other having no one in freedom. This is an important,intelligent and accurate film for females but at it's core its also a life study for men and women equally. May I also add, that no wonder Nicole Holofcener has used Catherine Keener all these years.... Shes a great actress. And This is proof that Kevin Corrigan has always been amazing.

    Catherine Keener (as Amelia) spends the opening scenes putting down everyone in her life. She doesn't like best friend Anne Heche (as Laura)'s engagement ring. She calls video store geek Kevin Corrigan (as Bill), who wants to date her, "The Ugly Guy". She repeatedly calls ex-boyfriend-turned-friend Liev Schreiber (as Andrew) an ass----, for enjoying telephone sex. Her cat has cancer. And, her kitchen sponge stinks. Intriguing character study, from writer/director Nicole Holofcener. Ms. Keener's "Amelia" seems to have a lot going for her; she is funny and attractive, and, she manages to keep friendships while being excessively judgmental. Things may have started going wrong for her when roommate Heche moved in with boyfriend Todd Field (as Frank). Mr. Field becomes another supportive friend, however. Although Keener is cranky throughout, she eventually proves to be an interesting, supportive friend. The performances are all terrific. Mr. Corrigan may be most memorable, as the horror movie geek Keener labels "The Ugly Guy"; watch for an outstanding scene as he overhears a message on Keener telephone answering machine. Some back-hair might have helped him look more ugly, though. Then, again, hairier Rafael Alvarez does seem prove excessive hair isn't so ugly. Wonderfully ironic to see Randall Batinkoff (as Peter) play a waiter so well, and an actor so poorly. "Walking and Talking" manages to be a story about meaningful friendship without being terribly meaningful. ****** Walking and Talking (1996) Nicole Holofcener ~ Catherine Keener, Anne Heche, Kevin Corrigan

    Amelia (Catherine Keener) is a very needy person. Therefore, losing her childhood friend Laura (Anne Heche) as a roommate has been tough. Laura has moved in with her boyfriend and is on the verge of becoming engaged. That hurts, as Amelia has not had good luck with men. She is forever phoning her best friend, nevertheless, for advice and for support in coping with life's problems, from a sick cat to a former boyfriend/pornography addict (Liev Schreiber). Laura, a counselor, does her best to be available for Amelia, but wedding plans and minor tifts with her intended leave her with less free time than ever. Will Amelia learn to just stand on her own two feet, for goodness sake? This is a quietly thoughtful film about friendship and its boundaries. Keener is wonderful as the friend who relies on others to help her through life's ups and downs. Even the most cherished friendships need room to breathe and Amelia has to learn this the hard way. Heche is likewise very fine as the beautiful lady who appears to have it all but may, in fact, have some flaws, too. Todd Field is great as Laura's fianc&eacute; and Schrieber gives a nice turn as a commitment phobic, sexually obsessive addict. All of the production necessities, from costumes to sets to direction, are quite nice. Then, too, the script is quirky, funny and original as well. No, this is not a thrill-a-minute adventure, so those who eschew slower paced, dialogue-driven films will want to skip over this one. Yet, if you adore romantic dramas brimming with life, humor, and important statements, here is the film you've been looking for. Walk to the nearest video outlet and peruse the shelves until you grasp this little gem in your hands.

    Terrific acting from a terrific cast, hilarious and clever dialog within a top script. Never a dull moment. The film avoids sliding from comedy into tedious sentimentality, and this is due to the fact that it's an independent film and not one of those Hollywood formula comedies that run out of jokes halfway, then hide behind clich&eacute;d boo-hoo-hoo crap. Only the last few minutes get a little schmaltzy, but not in any sort of irritating way. The film is more down-to-Earth than some other films of this kind; it avoids pretentiousness creeping into the dialog - the script's aim being to be humorous and not preachy. The only pity is that the film is rather short. Many funny scenes, a lot of which stem from a very original approach to humour; the biopsied-mole-gift "incident", Corrigan laughing about a cat having cancer, a patient who lies about his problems just to be interesting to Heche, Keener renting out pornos for her ex-boyfriend, Keener refusing to "finance" her ex-boyfriend's high long-distance sex-on-the-phone phone bills, Keener getting upset at Schreiber after he honestly answers her question about why they split up, Heche complaining to her fianc&eacute;e that their sex-life is getting predictable (+ a detailed description of why it's so), Keener refusing to even consider the idea of an "execution of my cat" (very funny wording), or - one of my favourite moments - Heche's fianc&eacute; referring to hers and Keener's music as "vagina music" (i.e. the sort of 90s American-generation-X-girl-on-guitar, acoustic plinka-plonka, trite, oh-so "deep", and utterly uninspired and dull radio crap, practiced by such "talents" as Heather Nova, Lisa Loeb, Jewel, and the like).

    Amelia has what everyone thinks they need, a job, a apartment, a cat, a best friend, a date (even though hes ugly) and she is even close friends with her ex. But then, things start slid to fast from under her feet, her cat gets cancer, her best friend, Laura, is getting married, and Bill(her ugly date), hasn't talked to her in two weeks.. All this time, she keeps up the appearance, while helping Laura pick out a place for the wedding, giving Andrew advice about his relationship with a girl in California, treating her cats cancer, and trying to win over Bill. this is one of those films that everyone (apart from small children) can have something in common. whether they have commitment issues, as Laura has with Frank , or you still like your ex, like Andrew does Amelia, or you feel like the third wheel, just like Amelia does with Laura, or you feel very distant from your partner, as Frank does with Laura. we all connect one of these characters to ourselves or someone we know. Everyone feels like Frank sometimes, walking on eggshells, not having any say in anything anymore. Everyone feels like Laura sometimes, like everything is going to fast, and you want to go back and enjoy life as it was before. Everyone feels like Andrew sometimes, we get so close to getting back with an ex, and being rejected nicely. And Everyone feels like Amelia sometimes, when nothing is going is your way, and nobody is listening.

    I stumbled upon this on Showtime cable, sitting in a hotel room in Kingston, Jam, nursing a nasty little virus and seeking some cheering up. What a lovely surprise. As another reviewer says, beautifully written, well acted, unpretentious and just very simply appealing. I'm really too old for voyages of discovery and young love but the stunning soundtrack featuring the wonderfully eloquent Billy Bragg evoked so many lovely memories for me. Curious how a cockney poet's music can work with an American romance...but it did. A real gem to watch on your own, with a partner or a good friend and, if you don't have a virus, a good glass of red wine.

    this is what audiences need to see more of. Good characterization, realistic dialog (no slap-stick cheap tricks, farce etc.) and capable actors. I have seen "Friends With Money" which was a disappointment compared to this and "Lovely and Amazing". This film succeeds because we care about the characters, Anne Heche as the therapist, trying to control her wedding, Catherine Keener as confused and disappointed single again friend. Andrew and Laura (Schreiber and Keener), Frank and Amelia,(Ann Heche and Todd Field) two couples just trying to make things work. They have to find humor in minor things. Kevin Corrigan adds humor as Keener's sometime date, who finds out he is referred to as the "ugly guy". Liev Schreiber adds a good element to the film. Keener's former boyfriend, he is there for her, even as she pursues Corrigan who works at a video store:..."Jeez look at him...I thought I could relax for once"... Keener says as she wonders why he has rejected her. This has been compared to "Sex and the City", but there really is no comparison. A one hour TV show vs. film; this film has resonance; we will remember and want to see these characters again, they are not cardboard cut-out characterizations. TV has to be more polarized, due to the medium and time limits, hence the characters are more superficial and obvious.(Could we picture Kim Catrall in this film, I don't think so). I am surprised Nicole Holfcener has not surmised this, and realized the casting mistake in "Friends with Money"; if someone has a too-TV persona, they do not necessarily translate to film. That was one of the problems with FWM. Also the performances in this film were not preceded by the personalities. Heche is believable, amusing and sympathetic. Catherine Keener is quirky, interesting and multi-layered. Liev Schreiber is funny, a good friend and we want to see more of him. Please, Ms. Holofcener, for your next film use film actors, not people who had a high "TV Q" or were married to a film celebrity for a brief period. It makes a great deal of difference, and the finished product proves this to be so. 9/10

    Nicole Holofcener has a distinct eye for everyday events. 'Walking and Talking' is the first slice of life film from the same director who's made gems like 'Friends With Money', 'Lovely and Amazing' and 'Please Give'. All films mainly focus on the relationships of women. The center of 'Walking and Talking' is the friendship between Amelia and Laura. Holofcener and her actors Catherine Keener (a regular in the director's films) and Anne Heche do a superb job in depicting a friendship that is not always about hanging out and partying. What Holofcener portrays is a bond that has changed throughout the years for these two women but become stronger than before. They are open to each other, honest, judgmental without worrying about hurting each other. Feelings do get hurt but at the same time it is this honesty that is the strength of their relationship and what gets them through the tougher times. The director has cast Catherine Keener in all her feature films and has done so in distinct roles. In all these films, Keener's character is searching for satisfaction whether it's in marriage, friendship, human nature. The characters, though similar in many ways, also have distinct qualities especially in the way they cope with their problems and the people surrounding them. Of course, needless to say, Keener fits all roles to the T, turning in some of her best works. Anne Heche definitely holds her own. Liev Schreiber is adequate. Kevin Corrigan is great. Todd Field does a fine job too. On the technical side, it's nothing too flashy. Everything flows smoothly. The score gives it the right level of whimsical touch. The locations are beautiful yet simple. In the end, 'Walking and Talking' is a universal human story about friendship. Holofcener did a terrific job telling such a story in her first film and she has continued to do so in her following features.

    This is a pleasant slice-of-life comedy about two young women experiencing love and heartache. This was the first feature film for writer-director Holofcener, and she has made a career out of such small films about relationships, particularly among women, all starring Keener. The actress is so good at this sort of role that she doesn't even appear to be acting. Heche is equally good as Keener's best friend, engaged to be married to goofy Schreiber. It's not a great film by any means, but the characters are real and likable, making it easy to spend some time with them. Holofcener has a talent for making keen observations about human behavior.

    Walking And Talking is a lot more talking than walking. It's the sort of film that some will think is the cat's meow while others will despise it like it's a child molester and both points of view will be valid. That's because while this movie is well done, what it does is so blisteringly ordinary. Just about anyone who watches it will have moments of emotional recognition for what's going on in the story and most will spend the time in between those moments plaintively waiting for the talking and walking to go anywhere. Amelia (Catherine Keener) is a single woman in New York City. She has a lifelong best friend named Laura (Anne Heche) who's now living with a boyfriend (Todd Field). Amelia doesn't have a boyfriend. She does have an ex-boyfriend named Andrew (Liev Schrieber) who hangs around like Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld. Amelia's also got a cat dying of cancer and a video store clerk/horror movie fan (Kevin Corrigan) who wants to bone her. As soon as Laura's boyfriend proposes to her, she starts fancying other men. As soon as Amelia gets comfortable with "settling" for the video store clerk, he dumps her for saying he's ugly behind his back. Andrew has a father with Alzheimer's and a pseudo-girlfriend in California whom he wants to dump right after he has phone sex with her. Amelia feels abandoned by Laura not always being there for her and Laura can't always be there for her because she's actually gone out and gotten a life of her own. Now take all of that and coat it with 2 &frac12; inches of well written but mostly inconsequential blather and you've got Walking And Talking. It'll work for you if you like the performers, enjoy having a waterfall of very short scenes splash over you and appreciate examinations of humanity in utterly unexceptional circumstances. It'll feel like a potato peeler across your forehead if you want characters that are likable, need a story to have some propulsion and don't want to watch a motion picture that's less interesting than your own life. Catherine Keener does a wonderful job playing a woman you really wouldn't want to know. Anne Hech is as good playing a woman you would want to know but would have a love/hate relationship with. Liev Schreiber is okay, except for the fact that Amelia and Andrew's relationship is written as though Nicole Holofcener has never met a man, let alone dated one. Ex-lovers can certainly break up and still find a way to be friends. That way is not going to be like it is here, where Amelia treats Andrew like her gay best friend and Andrew behaves like he's her gay best friend. That's an odd way for ex-lovers to relate and requires a lot more explanation than it gets in Walking And Talking. Which is a complaint that could be levied against much of this script. While the film is already too long as 86 minutes, the story feels like significant parts of it are regularly being skipped in order to show you scenes that would normally be cut out of a film to tighten it up. None of it's bad, but you can't help thinking there's something more important you should be seeing. If you like dramas where the drama is muted, comedies where the comedy produces more knowing grins than giggles and romances where you don't particularly care if the lovers get together or not, give Walking And Talking a try. If you can take pleasure from craft for its own sake, give Walking And Talking a try. If you want a movie that doesn't remind you of the inane conversations you've had with your own friends, find something else to watch

    Even in her first film back in 1996, Nicole Holocenfer has always been the best at conveying so much feeling, with so little. 'Walking and Talking' is an impressive Nicole Holocenfer starter and possibly her best as it gets everything just right in that Nicole Holofcener way. It doesn't over due with the bonding motives drenched in the appropriate music that Nicole Holocenfer can't see the cheese in and has induced in her more recent films immensely. This first effort also spawns Nicole's signature comedy of finding the hilarity in smug, annoying and odd strangers(who we all loathe), and in the funny but horrible shallowness of her characters in which has made Nicole known for making comedic movies since then.

But then, things start slid to fast from under her feet, her cat gets cancer, her best friend, Laura, is getting married, and Bill(her ugly date), hasn't talked to her in two weeks.. All this time, she keeps up the appearance, while helping Laura pick out a place for the wedding, giving Andrew advice about his relationship with a girl in California, treating her cats cancer, and trying to win over Bill. this is one of those films that everyone (apart from small children) can have something in common. whether they have commitment issues, as Laura has with Frank , or you still like your ex, like Andrew does Amelia, or you feel like the third wheel, just like Amelia does with Laura, or you feel very distant from your partner, as Frank does with Laura. we all connect one of these characters to ourselves or someone we know.

Everyone feels like Laura sometimes, like everything is going to fast, and you want to go back and enjoy life as it was before. Everyone feels like Andrew sometimes, we get so close to getting back with an ex, and being rejected nicely. And Everyone feels like Amelia sometimes, when nothing is going is your way, and nobody is listening.

    I stumbled upon this on Showtime cable, sitting in a hotel room in Kingston, Jam, nursing a nasty little virus and seeking some cheering up. What a lovely surprise. As another reviewer says, beautifully written, well acted, unpretentious and just very simply appealing. I'm really too old for voyages of discovery and young love but the stunning soundtrack featuring the wonderfully eloquent Billy Bragg evoked so many lovely memories for me. Curious how a cockney poet's music can work with an American romance...but it did. A real gem to watch on your own, with a partner or a good friend and, if you don't have a virus, a good glass of red wine.

    this is what audiences need to see more of. Good characterization, realistic dialog (no slap-stick cheap tricks, farce etc.) and capable actors. I have seen "Friends With Money" which was a disappointment compared to this and "Lovely and Amazing". This film succeeds because we care about the characters, Anne Heche as the therapist, trying to control her wedding, Catherine Keener as confused and disappointed single again friend. Andrew and Laura (Schreiber and Keener), Frank and Amelia,(Ann Heche and Todd Field) two couples just trying to make things work. They have to find humor in minor things. Kevin Corrigan adds humor as Keener's sometime date, who finds out he is referred to as the "ugly guy". Liev Schreiber adds a good element to the film. Keener's former boyfriend, he is there for her, even as she pursues Corrigan who works at a video store:..."Jeez look at him...I thought I could relax for once"... Keener says as she wonders why he has rejected her. This has been compared to "Sex and the City", but there really is no comparison. A one hour TV show vs. film; this film has resonance; we will remember and want to see these characters again, they are not cardboard cut-out characterizations. TV has to be more polarized, due to the medium and time limits, hence the characters are more superficial and obvious.(Could we picture Kim Catrall in this film, I don't think so). I am surprised Nicole Holfcener has not surmised this, and realized the casting mistake in "Friends with Money"; if someone has a too-TV persona, they do not necessarily translate to film. That was one of the problems with FWM. Also the performances in this film were not preceded by the personalities. Heche is believable, amusing and sympathetic. Catherine Keener is quirky, interesting and multi-layered. Liev Schreiber is funny, a good friend and we want to see more of him. Please, Ms. Holofcener, for your next film use film actors, not people who had a high "TV Q" or were married to a film celebrity for a brief period. It makes a great deal of difference, and the finished product proves this to be so. 9/10

    Nicole Holofcener has a distinct eye for everyday events. 'Walking and Talking' is the first slice of life film from the same director who's made gems like 'Friends With Money', 'Lovely and Amazing' and 'Please Give'. All films mainly focus on the relationships of women. The center of 'Walking and Talking' is the friendship between Amelia and Laura. Holofcener and her actors Catherine Keener (a regular in the director's films) and Anne Heche do a superb job in depicting a friendship that is not always about hanging out and partying. What Holofcener portrays is a bond that has changed throughout the years for these two women but become stronger than before. They are open to each other, honest, judgmental without worrying about hurting each other. Feelings do get hurt but at the same time it is this honesty that is the strength of their relationship and what gets them through the tougher times. The director has cast Catherine Keener in all her feature films and has done so in distinct roles. In all these films, Keener's character is searching for satisfaction whether it's in marriage, friendship, human nature. The characters, though similar in many ways, also have distinct qualities especially in the way they cope with their problems and the people surrounding them. Of course, needless to say, Keener fits all roles to the T, turning in some of her best works. Anne Heche definitely holds her own. Liev Schreiber is adequate. Kevin Corrigan is great. Todd Field does a fine job too. On the technical side, it's nothing too flashy. Everything flows smoothly. The score gives it the right level of whimsical touch. The locations are beautiful yet simple. In the end, 'Walking and Talking' is a universal human story about friendship. Holofcener did a terrific job telling such a story in her first film and she has continued to do so in her following features.

    This is a pleasant slice-of-life comedy about two young women experiencing love and heartache. This was the first feature film for writer-director Holofcener, and she has made a career out of such small films about relationships, particularly among women, all starring Keener. The actress is so good at this sort of role that she doesn't even appear to be acting. Heche is equally good as Keener's best friend, engaged to be married to goofy Schreiber. It's not a great film by any means, but the characters are real and likable, making it easy to spend some time with them. Holofcener has a talent for making keen observations about human behavior.

    Walking And Talking is a lot more talking than walking. It's the sort of film that some will think is the cat's meow while others will despise it like it's a child molester and both points of view will be valid. That's because while this movie is well done, what it does is so blisteringly ordinary. Just about anyone who watches it will have moments of emotional recognition for what's going on in the story and most will spend the time in between those moments plaintively waiting for the talking and walking to go anywhere. Amelia (Catherine Keener) is a single woman in New York City. She has a lifelong best friend named Laura (Anne Heche) who's now living with a boyfriend (Todd Field). Amelia doesn't have a boyfriend. She does have an ex-boyfriend named Andrew (Liev Schrieber) who hangs around like Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld. Amelia's also got a cat dying of cancer and a video store clerk/horror movie fan (Kevin Corrigan) who wants to bone her. As soon as Laura's boyfriend proposes to her, she starts fancying other men. As soon as Amelia gets comfortable with "settling" for the video store clerk, he dumps her for saying he's ugly behind his back. Andrew has a father with Alzheimer's and a pseudo-girlfriend in California whom he wants to dump right after he has phone sex with her. Amelia feels abandoned by Laura not always being there for her and Laura can't always be there for her because she's actually gone out and gotten a life of her own. Now take all of that and coat it with 2 &frac12; inches of well written but mostly inconsequential blather and you've got Walking And Talking. It'll work for you if you like the performers, enjoy having a waterfall of very short scenes splash over you and appreciate examinations of humanity in utterly unexceptional circumstances. It'll feel like a potato peeler across your forehead if you want characters that are likable, need a story to have some propulsion and don't want to watch a motion picture that's less interesting than your own life. Catherine Keener does a wonderful job playing a woman you really wouldn't want to know. Anne Hech is as good playing a woman you would want to know but would have a love/hate relationship with. Liev Schreiber is okay, except for the fact that Amelia and Andrew's relationship is written as though Nicole Holofcener has never met a man, let alone dated one. Ex-lovers can certainly break up and still find a way to be friends. That way is not going to be like it is here, where Amelia treats Andrew like her gay best friend and Andrew behaves like he's her gay best friend. That's an odd way for ex-lovers to relate and requires a lot more explanation than it gets in Walking And Talking. Which is a complaint that could be levied against much of this script. While the film is already too long as 86 minutes, the story feels like significant parts of it are regularly being skipped in order to show you scenes that would normally be cut out of a film to tighten it up. None of it's bad, but you can't help thinking there's something more important you should be seeing. If you like dramas where the drama is muted, comedies where the comedy produces more knowing grins than giggles and romances where you don't particularly care if the lovers get together or not, give Walking And Talking a try. If you can take pleasure from craft for its own sake, give Walking And Talking a try. If you want a movie that doesn't remind you of the inane conversations you've had with your own friends, find something else to watch

    Even in her first film back in 1996, Nicole Holocenfer has always been the best at conveying so much feeling, with so little. 'Walking and Talking' is an impressive Nicole Holocenfer starter and possibly her best as it gets everything just right in that Nicole Holofcener way. It doesn't over due with the bonding motives drenched in the appropriate music that Nicole Holocenfer can't see the cheese in and has induced in her more recent films immensely. This first effort also spawns Nicole's signature comedy of finding the hilarity in smug, annoying and odd strangers(who we all loathe), and in the funny but horrible shallowness of her characters in which has made Nicole known for making comedic movies since then. The writing here is more raw and youthful with Nicole's feelings as a girl and a woman, maybe because of the times but this makes for more original, interesting, and entertaining dialogue and performances.'Walking and Talking' unlike Nicole's later films, also doesn't hit you over the head with the acts of one dimensional characters as each character properly goes through a vary of feelings and moods as they each go through various different situations of life, more so like real people. With this, (unfortuantely unlike her other films) she doesn't make the men in the movie side notes and props. They get a say too and convey almost as much emotion as the female characters. Nicole Holofcener's point in her movies maybe to make women the forefront of her movies and to make men the props, but I personally find it insulting and typical to do this, so it was perfect to see her first effort was true to everyone. Nicole's direction style, especially with this entire, tells us shes not afraid to make things wacky to convey a character's thoughts and emotions even in a story of real-life, and with her camera direction as well, she always makes things feel interesting to watch as characters appear on the screen and as scenes coming along with a simple pan, although things going on in the movie are average life situations. And she never pushes a scene into a more sexually or exciting realm for interest of the viewer, as she keeps scenes in the reality of what it is depicting, which is wonderful because its real. She proves to be a big fan of the fade in and fade out into and out of sequences as its used here and in her later films, but it makes more sense in 'Walking and Talking'and brings certain meaning to certain scenes as appose to 'Friends with Money' but the fade out was interesting in that movie none-the-less. This direction style with the soft, awkward acoustic music to the scenes can be also seen as influential to the indie movie scene of 2000s with it's structure, to movies like 'Juno'. This is a great 90's time capsule and even unrated as a definitive 90's movie with it's great 90's soundtrack and band references, it's geek-tom fan fair, and laid-back lifestyles of the characters so significant to generation x. This first effort years ago, shows that Nicole Holofcener gets like no other the awkwardness of relating to ageing family members and ageing in general. The feeling of being lonely, and feeling that time is passing by and being wasted having your own ironic stupid superficial ideals hold you back from being with someone who wants to fill the void and who thinks your the bell-of-the-ball, and that you don't know someone can make you happy until you give them a shot, because you can't wait forever. This is also one of the most accurate films showing the jealously shared between to friends, of one having someone in companionship, and the other having no one in freedom. This is an important,intelligent and accurate film for females but at it's core its also a life study for men and women equally. May I also add, that no wonder Nicole Holofcener has used Catherine Keener all these years.... Shes a great actress. And This is proof that Kevin Corrigan has always been amazing.

    Catherine Keener (as Amelia) spends the opening scenes putting down everyone in her life. She doesn't like best friend Anne Heche (as Laura)'s engagement ring. She calls video store geek Kevin Corrigan (as Bill), who wants to date her, "The Ugly Guy". She repeatedly calls ex-boyfriend-turned-friend Liev Schreiber (as Andrew) an ass----, for enjoying telephone sex. Her cat has cancer. And, her kitchen sponge stinks. Intriguing character study, from writer/director Nicole Holofcener. Ms. Keener's "Amelia" seems to have a lot going for her; she is funny and attractive, and, she manages to keep friendships while being excessively judgmental. Things may have started going wrong for her when roommate Heche moved in with boyfriend Todd Field (as Frank). Mr. Field becomes another supportive friend, however. Although Keener is cranky throughout, she eventually proves to be an interesting, supportive friend. The performances are all terrific. Mr. Corrigan may be most memorable, as the horror movie geek Keener labels "The Ugly Guy"; watch for an outstanding scene as he overhears a message on Keener telephone answering machine. Some back-hair might have helped him look more ugly, though. Then, again, hairier Rafael Alvarez does seem prove excessive hair isn't so ugly. Wonderfully ironic to see Randall Batinkoff (as Peter) play a waiter so well, and an actor so poorly. "Walking and Talking" manages to be a story about meaningful friendship without being terribly meaningful. ****** Walking and Talking (1996) Nicole Holofcener ~ Catherine Keener, Anne Heche, Kevin Corrigan

    Amelia (Catherine Keener) is a very needy person. Therefore, losing her childhood friend Laura (Anne Heche) as a roommate has been tough. Laura has moved in with her boyfriend and is on the verge of becoming engaged. That hurts, as Amelia has not had good luck with men. She is forever phoning her best friend, nevertheless, for advice and for support in coping with life's problems, from a sick cat to a former boyfriend/pornography addict (Liev Schreiber). Laura, a counselor, does her best to be available for Amelia, but wedding plans and minor tifts with her intended leave her with less free time than ever. Will Amelia learn to just stand on her own two feet, for goodness sake? This is a quietly thoughtful film about friendship and its boundaries. Keener is wonderful as the friend who relies on others to help her through life's ups and downs. Even the most cherished friendships need room to breathe and Amelia has to learn this the hard way. Heche is likewise very fine as the beautiful lady who appears to have it all but may, in fact, have some flaws, too. Todd Field is great as Laura's fianc&eacute; and Schrieber gives a nice turn as a commitment phobic, sexually obsessive addict. All of the production necessities, from costumes to sets to direction, are quite nice. Then, too, the script is quirky, funny and original as well. No, this is not a thrill-a-minute adventure, so those who eschew slower paced, dialogue-driven films will want to skip over this one. Yet, if you adore romantic dramas brimming with life, humor, and important statements, here is the film you've been looking for. Walk to the nearest video outlet and peruse the shelves until you grasp this little gem in your hands.

    Terrific acting from a terrific cast, hilarious and clever dialog within a top script. Never a dull moment. The film avoids sliding from comedy into tedious sentimentality, and this is due to the fact that it's an independent film and not one of those Hollywood formula comedies that run out of jokes halfway, then hide behind clich&eacute;d boo-hoo-hoo crap. Only the last few minutes get a little schmaltzy, but not in any sort of irritating way. The film is more down-to-Earth than some other films of this kind; it avoids pretentiousness creeping into the dialog - the script's aim being to be humorous and not preachy. The only pity is that the film is rather short. Many funny scenes, a lot of which stem from a very original approach to humour; the biopsied-mole-gift "incident", Corrigan laughing about a cat having cancer, a patient who lies about his problems just to be interesting to Heche, Keener renting out pornos for her ex-boyfriend, Keener refusing to "finance" her ex-boyfriend's high long-distance sex-on-the-phone phone bills, Keener getting upset at Schreiber after he honestly answers her question about why they split up, Heche complaining to her fianc&eacute;e that their sex-life is getting predictable (+ a detailed description of why it's so), Keener refusing to even consider the idea of an "execution of my cat" (very funny wording), or - one of my favourite moments - Heche's fianc&eacute; referring to hers and Keener's music as "vagina music" (i.e. the sort of 90s American-generation-X-girl-on-guitar, acoustic plinka-plonka, trite, oh-so "deep", and utterly uninspired and dull radio crap, practiced by such "talents" as Heather Nova, Lisa Loeb, Jewel, and the like).

    Amelia has what everyone thinks they need, a job, a apartment, a cat, a best friend, a date (even though hes ugly) and she is even close friends with her ex. But then, things start slid to fast from under her feet, her cat gets cancer, her best friend, Laura, is getting married, and Bill(her ugly date), hasn't talked to her in two weeks.. All this time, she keeps up the appearance, while helping Laura pick out a place for the wedding, giving Andrew advice about his relationship with a girl in California, treating her cats cancer, and trying to win over Bill. this is one of those films that everyone (apart from small children) can have something in common. whether they have commitment issues, as Laura has with Frank , or you still like your ex, like Andrew does Amelia, or you feel like the third wheel, just like Amelia does with Laura, or you feel very distant from your partner, as Frank does with Laura. we all connect one of these characters to ourselves or someone we know.
