  Eddy and Stuart share two-thirds of a dormitory suite. Due to bureaucratic error, a woman named Alex is added to their room. At first, relations among the three are tense. Soon, however, Alex falls for Eddy, and Stuart lusts after Alex. Eddy comes to realize not only that he's gay, but that he's attracted to Stuart. The three pledge not to act on any romantic (or lustful) feelings with each other, and become close friends . . . while bottling up a lot of sexual tension.

    All in all, a below average watch. There is no touch with reality - whether from a relationship perspective, college life, friendships, or anything else. The acting is atrocious, as far as Baldwin and Boyle go. Charles redeems it a bit - but only a BIT. The situations are simply ridiculous. Statements are made, and then left hanging without culmination. Friendships are portrayed with an emptiness around them that is difficult to understand. Considering the writer is the director (Fleming), not much more could've been expected since the story itself is so awful. I saw the movie 'coz the actors are from my era, and I thought it would be nostalgic. Hardly - avoid it if you can.

    I started off watching this film with little hope of it being very good, but as the film went on, I found myself getting further sucked into the plot and relating with the characters. I usually hate romantic comedies but this film is different to the usual film from the genre - the characters were well developed - I felt like I really knew them and recognised them in people I actually know. The pacing was perfect - not too fast and I was able to get a real sense of what was going on. The plot completely believable too because of how it was presented, the themes of friendship and sexuality were well portrayed and not too rushed. The amount of comedy was perfect and I just generally really liked this film! However I would have liked to have seen more development of Eddy's character if I am brutally honest as I feel that him being gay should have played a bigger part in the film. Although, considering the time it was produced and released, it's safe to say that the film was pretty risky. I would love to see a more modern interpretation or remake.

    If this is what your college experience is supposed to be like, forget it. These type of films have nothing whatsoever to do with such an experience. To say that they have missed the true meaning of the college years is to put it mildly. Thank the Lord that Josh Charles grew up, matured and has landed the prime role of Will Gardner in "The Good Wife." This picture, to put it mildly, is the pits. What are we supposed to say, that it's the sexual coming out of a menage a trois? The whole concept was ridiculous at best. I think that the film would have been better off had Ms. Boyle not entered the film and the movie dealt with the exploits of two guys sharing a room, both of whom had absolutely nothing in common with each other. When will they make a movie that shows you the difficulty of college life insofar as academics?

    'Threesome' is one such film that you simply cannot overlook or avoid. Films like this are very rare to witness these days where the plot is very simplified and revolves around just three college friends and their self discoveries. Very, in fact very rare films focus on college life in such a close manner and this film is much more than just three college friends in a room. In brief, 'Threesome' is the perfect example of a simplified cinema with a neat and perfect execution in every sense, from the precise direction by Andrew Fleming to the brilliant performances by Josh Charles, Lara Boyle and Stephen Baldwin. Charles, Boyle and Baldwin deliver one of their very best performances here, easily giving you the impression that you are just witnessing three friends and not the actors. The chemistry between these three is very touching and strong enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, making you a part of their journey throughout the film. Its a film that gets better and better on repeated viewings, trust me you will never get enough of it, its really a ride. A 9.9 out of 10!

    (spoiler alert) Not that I actually think I'm going to reveal anything this time around, but this is my first review in awhile and I've just discovered that IMDb insists that you put a warning up here. Of all the movies I've seen, of all the films that I love, this would seem to be the one that's most misunderstood on here. For some reason a lot of people (even Stephen Baldwin, one of the stars in the thing who's since gotten religion, and is now disavowing the film) think this is some kind of soft-porn film. It isn't, not at all. So half the people, the ones that wanted it to be a porn film, are disappointed, and the other half, without even having bothered seeing the film, say that it's immoral. This isn't a porn film at all. It's about friendship. It's one of the most on-the-mark movies about friendship that I've ever seen. Is there sex involved? Yes, of course. In case you've never noticed, we (and every other critter on the planet) are sexual beings, it's an urge in all of us. And if anyone would actually watch the film and just pay attention, it isn't all about overcoming inhibitions and setting free your desires; by the end of the film it becomes apparent that there are prices to be paid. (Well, I guess that was a spoiler, of sorts. But what's with this "spoiler" thing, anyway? There isn't a film book in the world that discusses, say, "Psycho" without giving away the ending! Since when has it become so important to not say anything about the movie? Hell, "Threesome" is about two guys and a girl..."SHHH!!! You're spoiling it for me!" LOL) Anyway, it has a very witty yet believable script and wonderful performances by all the actors (including, I must add, one of the most erotic scenes I've ever seen in my life, the one in the library. This might not be porn, but Lara was hot as hell back then!) And, by the end (if you're paying attention, and not assuming or hoping that it was a porn film) you're left on this terribly moving bittersweet note. Times change, people move on. This was a wonderful movie (if misunderstood), much better than its immediate rival that came out around the same time, "Reality Bites." In the end, the thing that the film is truly about is how ephemeral things can be. It can't show you, vividly, how things can fall apart, it can't make you feel for them or what will happen to and between them without spending the first 80 or so minutes putting them together. After all of that, you realize the tragedy and frailty of friendships and loves. And, in the end, that is truly what the movie is about. And, in the end, that's what life is all about.

    Threesome (1994) *** (out of 4) Surprisingly effective comedy/drama about roommates Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) and Eddy (Josh Charles) whose lives turn upside down when Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) moves into their dorm room. At first the three don't hit it off but that quickly changes and soon Alex likes Eddy, Stuart likes Alex and Eddy like Stuart. I remember watching this thing when it first came out and while this viewing didn't live up to what I remembered, I was still surprised at how well it did hold up all these years later. I think the film, unlike many, tried to be serious about it's subject matter and the three relationships that eventually evolve over the running time. For the most part the film doesn't hit any false moments as you will really feel as if you are watching three different characters come into their own while at college when sex is running free. The screenplay by director Fleming does a nice job at developing all three characters and their relationships with one another. I think the film doesn't shy away from its subject and in the end we're greeting to quite a few dramatic moments as well as some very funny ones. I think the running joke about all the pizza being eaten could have been left out but I don't fault the film too much for this. The performances by the three leads are quite effective with both Boyle and Charles really shining in their roles. Both of them handles their roles perfectly well with Boyle nailing the confusion and frustration of her character and Charles really coming off well as someone who doesn't know who he is. Baldwin adds a lot of laughter as the sex hungry male.

    Threesome (1994) *** out of **** Directed by Andrew Fleming With Josh Charles, Lara Flynn Boyle, Stephen Baldwin Great comedy drama about three friends who share the room: Baldwin wants Boyle, Boyle wants Charles, Charles wants Baldwin. Strong, decent comedy about friendship, unrequited love and sex. Full of life and well executed. Is not excellent and nothing from another world, of course, but is nothing pretentious as much others. Spectacular performances by all.

    This is one seriously underrated movie. The humor is very clever and mature (compared to say, a Will Farrell style college movie). I love the narration by the Eddy character, it makes this movie so much more. He makes you really feel what he's feeling. All three characters take you on their journey of self discovery, a bit of sexual experimentation that often occurs while in college, and most of all - the painful truth about "How can someone be such a necessary part of one's life one moment, and simply vanish the next?" How true is that?! One should also note the amazing original score by Thomas Newman. He's composed music for a ton of other movies too such as American Beauty, Pay It Forward, Erin Brockovich - just to scratch the surface. I recently became obsessed with finding this music, that is NOT included on the Threesome soundtrack (although the non-original music on that CD is a great compilation, including U2's "Dancing Barefoot" - a phenomenal song). I found it just this week if anyone else has been going crazy trying to find this music. It's on the American Buffalo soundtrack. The first half of the CD the score for American Buffalo score (which is pretty mediocre), and the last half is the original score to Threesome! Anyway, I think all three characters are VERY well played by the actors, even Stephen Baldwin - although I'm sure the role of the obnoxious, sex-obsessed roommate was tailor-made for the guy at that time. I love his and all the characters, and wouldn't change a thing about how they contribute to the three-way relationship that's formed as well as the story line. This movie is also very believable, a quality I love and a quality that keeps me from watching overly melodramatic "classics" like Gone With the Wind. I just don't believe the characters in those types of movies! So if you saw Threesome before and only thought it was so-so, give it another chance. Try to see it with new eyes, and for the love of God, listen to the original music when you can catch it. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. The DVD offers a couple of alternate endings, but I like the one they ultimately chose best. So it's not the happiest of endings, it's an extremely realistic ending. I was left completely satisfied.

    I savor entertainment that explores relationships realistically, I delight in work that succeeds in portraying a group of friends who really look like they care for one another, I even feast on featherlight relationship comedies (if they appear sincere and heartfelt, which doesn't occur that often). What I don't indulge in are pointless, pretentious pieces of 'art', that consist of a contrived script and an excruciatingly bad acting ensemble. Unfortunately, the latter is what best summarizes this drivel involving one-dimensional cardboard characters twaddling about nothing at all. In many ways a relationship between three people is endlessly more interesting than the classic pair. Unfortunately for myself and all other viewers victim of witnessing this movie, the writer leaves all the intriguing and intelligent parts out and what we are left with is a pretty formulaic comedy about people who want what they can't have. Been there, seen that...utterly boring. I'd skip this one if I were you.

    This movie is a charmer. I suspect you have to be American, or have an American sensibility, to fully appreciate this film. I can easily see Europeans wondering what there is to be conflicted about, and I can see people from developing countries finding it a depiction of something that could never happen. Believe me, it can and does. The three young actors, all now much better known for other roles, play characters who will seem very real to you--especially if you can remember back to the sturm and drang of your college years. The dialog is as sharp and clever as anything you will hear anywhere. There is a scene where a naive girl, who has been brought to a threesome dinner party by one of the boys, flees the room in tears. Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) gives a raucous, malicious laugh and says, "I like her." It's a stunning moment, and drop dead funny. I hope this film eventually gets the attention it deserves. It is seriously neglected, certainly one of the most entertaining movies of its decade. In the gay community, this movie seems pretty much unknown. Which is a shame, because a gay audience would really get this movie.

Unfortunately for myself and all other viewers victim of witnessing this movie, the writer leaves all the intriguing and intelligent parts out and what we are left with is a pretty formulaic comedy about people who want what they can't have. Been there, seen that...utterly boring. I'd skip this one if I were you.

    This movie is a charmer. I suspect you have to be American, or have an American sensibility, to fully appreciate this film. I can easily see Europeans wondering what there is to be conflicted about, and I can see people from developing countries finding it a depiction of something that could never happen. Believe me, it can and does. The three young actors, all now much better known for other roles, play characters who will seem very real to you--especially if you can remember back to the sturm and drang of your college years. The dialog is as sharp and clever as anything you will hear anywhere. There is a scene where a naive girl, who has been brought to a threesome dinner party by one of the boys, flees the room in tears. Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) gives a raucous, malicious laugh and says, "I like her." It's a stunning moment, and drop dead funny. I hope this film eventually gets the attention it deserves. It is seriously neglected, certainly one of the most entertaining movies of its decade. In the gay community, this movie seems pretty much unknown. Which is a shame, because a gay audience would really get this movie.

    All in all, a below average watch. There is no touch with reality - whether from a relationship perspective, college life, friendships, or anything else. The acting is atrocious, as far as Baldwin and Boyle go. Charles redeems it a bit - but only a BIT. The situations are simply ridiculous. Statements are made, and then left hanging without culmination. Friendships are portrayed with an emptiness around them that is difficult to understand. Considering the writer is the director (Fleming), not much more could've been expected since the story itself is so awful. I saw the movie 'coz the actors are from my era, and I thought it would be nostalgic. Hardly - avoid it if you can.

    I started off watching this film with little hope of it being very good, but as the film went on, I found myself getting further sucked into the plot and relating with the characters. I usually hate romantic comedies but this film is different to the usual film from the genre - the characters were well developed - I felt like I really knew them and recognised them in people I actually know. The pacing was perfect - not too fast and I was able to get a real sense of what was going on. The plot completely believable too because of how it was presented, the themes of friendship and sexuality were well portrayed and not too rushed. The amount of comedy was perfect and I just generally really liked this film! However I would have liked to have seen more development of Eddy's character if I am brutally honest as I feel that him being gay should have played a bigger part in the film. Although, considering the time it was produced and released, it's safe to say that the film was pretty risky. I would love to see a more modern interpretation or remake.

    If this is what your college experience is supposed to be like, forget it. These type of films have nothing whatsoever to do with such an experience. To say that they have missed the true meaning of the college years is to put it mildly. Thank the Lord that Josh Charles grew up, matured and has landed the prime role of Will Gardner in "The Good Wife." This picture, to put it mildly, is the pits. What are we supposed to say, that it's the sexual coming out of a menage a trois? The whole concept was ridiculous at best. I think that the film would have been better off had Ms. Boyle not entered the film and the movie dealt with the exploits of two guys sharing a room, both of whom had absolutely nothing in common with each other. When will they make a movie that shows you the difficulty of college life insofar as academics?

    'Threesome' is one such film that you simply cannot overlook or avoid. Films like this are very rare to witness these days where the plot is very simplified and revolves around just three college friends and their self discoveries. Very, in fact very rare films focus on college life in such a close manner and this film is much more than just three college friends in a room. In brief, 'Threesome' is the perfect example of a simplified cinema with a neat and perfect execution in every sense, from the precise direction by Andrew Fleming to the brilliant performances by Josh Charles, Lara Boyle and Stephen Baldwin. Charles, Boyle and Baldwin deliver one of their very best performances here, easily giving you the impression that you are just witnessing three friends and not the actors. The chemistry between these three is very touching and strong enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, making you a part of their journey throughout the film. Its a film that gets better and better on repeated viewings, trust me you will never get enough of it, its really a ride. A 9.9 out of 10!

    (spoiler alert) Not that I actually think I'm going to reveal anything this time around, but this is my first review in awhile and I've just discovered that IMDb insists that you put a warning up here. Of all the movies I've seen, of all the films that I love, this would seem to be the one that's most misunderstood on here. For some reason a lot of people (even Stephen Baldwin, one of the stars in the thing who's since gotten religion, and is now disavowing the film) think this is some kind of soft-porn film. It isn't, not at all. So half the people, the ones that wanted it to be a porn film, are disappointed, and the other half, without even having bothered seeing the film, say that it's immoral. This isn't a porn film at all. It's about friendship. It's one of the most on-the-mark movies about friendship that I've ever seen. Is there sex involved? Yes, of course. In case you've never noticed, we (and every other critter on the planet) are sexual beings, it's an urge in all of us. And if anyone would actually watch the film and just pay attention, it isn't all about overcoming inhibitions and setting free your desires; by the end of the film it becomes apparent that there are prices to be paid. (Well, I guess that was a spoiler, of sorts. But what's with this "spoiler" thing, anyway? There isn't a film book in the world that discusses, say, "Psycho" without giving away the ending! Since when has it become so important to not say anything about the movie? Hell, "Threesome" is about two guys and a girl..."SHHH!!! You're spoiling it for me!" LOL) Anyway, it has a very witty yet believable script and wonderful performances by all the actors (including, I must add, one of the most erotic scenes I've ever seen in my life, the one in the library. This might not be porn, but Lara was hot as hell back then!) And, by the end (if you're paying attention, and not assuming or hoping that it was a porn film) you're left on this terribly moving bittersweet note. Times change, people move on. This was a wonderful movie (if misunderstood), much better than its immediate rival that came out around the same time, "Reality Bites." In the end, the thing that the film is truly about is how ephemeral things can be. It can't show you, vividly, how things can fall apart, it can't make you feel for them or what will happen to and between them without spending the first 80 or so minutes putting them together. After all of that, you realize the tragedy and frailty of friendships and loves. And, in the end, that is truly what the movie is about. And, in the end, that's what life is all about.

    Threesome (1994) *** (out of 4) Surprisingly effective comedy/drama about roommates Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) and Eddy (Josh Charles) whose lives turn upside down when Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) moves into their dorm room. At first the three don't hit it off but that quickly changes and soon Alex likes Eddy, Stuart likes Alex and Eddy like Stuart. I remember watching this thing when it first came out and while this viewing didn't live up to what I remembered, I was still surprised at how well it did hold up all these years later. I think the film, unlike many, tried to be serious about it's subject matter and the three relationships that eventually evolve over the running time. For the most part the film doesn't hit any false moments as you will really feel as if you are watching three different characters come into their own while at college when sex is running free. The screenplay by director Fleming does a nice job at developing all three characters and their relationships with one another. I think the film doesn't shy away from its subject and in the end we're greeting to quite a few dramatic moments as well as some very funny ones. I think the running joke about all the pizza being eaten could have been left out but I don't fault the film too much for this. The performances by the three leads are quite effective with both Boyle and Charles really shining in their roles. Both of them handles their roles perfectly well with Boyle nailing the confusion and frustration of her character and Charles really coming off well as someone who doesn't know who he is. Baldwin adds a lot of laughter as the sex hungry male.

    Threesome (1994) *** out of **** Directed by Andrew Fleming With Josh Charles, Lara Flynn Boyle, Stephen Baldwin Great comedy drama about three friends who share the room: Baldwin wants Boyle, Boyle wants Charles, Charles wants Baldwin. Strong, decent comedy about friendship, unrequited love and sex. Full of life and well executed. Is not excellent and nothing from another world, of course, but is nothing pretentious as much others. Spectacular performances by all.

    This is one seriously underrated movie. The humor is very clever and mature (compared to say, a Will Farrell style college movie). I love the narration by the Eddy character, it makes this movie so much more. He makes you really feel what he's feeling. All three characters take you on their journey of self discovery, a bit of sexual experimentation that often occurs while in college, and most of all - the painful truth about "How can someone be such a necessary part of one's life one moment, and simply vanish the next?" How true is that?! One should also note the amazing original score by Thomas Newman. He's composed music for a ton of other movies too such as American Beauty, Pay It Forward, Erin Brockovich - just to scratch the surface. I recently became obsessed with finding this music, that is NOT included on the Threesome soundtrack (although the non-original music on that CD is a great compilation, including U2's "Dancing Barefoot" - a phenomenal song). I found it just this week if anyone else has been going crazy trying to find this music. It's on the American Buffalo soundtrack. The first half of the CD the score for American Buffalo score (which is pretty mediocre), and the last half is the original score to Threesome! Anyway, I think all three characters are VERY well played by the actors, even Stephen Baldwin - although I'm sure the role of the obnoxious, sex-obsessed roommate was tailor-made for the guy at that time. I love his and all the characters, and wouldn't change a thing about how they contribute to the three-way relationship that's formed as well as the story line. This movie is also very believable, a quality I love and a quality that keeps me from watching overly melodramatic "classics" like Gone With the Wind. I just don't believe the characters in those types of movies! So if you saw Threesome before and only thought it was so-so, give it another chance. Try to see it with new eyes, and for the love of God, listen to the original music when you can catch it. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. The DVD offers a couple of alternate endings, but I like the one they ultimately chose best. So it's not the happiest of endings, it's an extremely realistic ending. I was left completely satisfied.

    I savor entertainment that explores relationships realistically, I delight in work that succeeds in portraying a group of friends who really look like they care for one another, I even feast on featherlight relationship comedies (if they appear sincere and heartfelt, which doesn't occur that often). What I don't indulge in are pointless, pretentious pieces of 'art', that consist of a contrived script and an excruciatingly bad acting ensemble. Unfortunately, the latter is what best summarizes this drivel involving one-dimensional cardboard characters twaddling about nothing at all. In many ways a relationship between three people is endlessly more interesting than the classic pair. Unfortunately for myself and all other viewers victim of witnessing this movie, the writer leaves all the intriguing and intelligent parts out and what we are left with is a pretty formulaic comedy about people who want what they can't have.

    This movie is a charmer. I suspect you have to be American, or have an American sensibility, to fully appreciate this film. I can easily see Europeans wondering what there is to be conflicted about, and I can see people from developing countries finding it a depiction of something that could never happen. Believe me, it can and does. The three young actors, all now much better known for other roles, play characters who will seem very real to you--especially if you can remember back to the sturm and drang of your college years. The dialog is as sharp and clever as anything you will hear anywhere. There is a scene where a naive girl, who has been brought to a threesome dinner party by one of the boys, flees the room in tears. Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) gives a raucous, malicious laugh and says, "I like her." It's a stunning moment, and drop dead funny. I hope this film eventually gets the attention it deserves. It is seriously neglected, certainly one of the most entertaining movies of its decade. In the gay community, this movie seems pretty much unknown. Which is a shame, because a gay audience would really get this movie.

    All in all, a below average watch. There is no touch with reality - whether from a relationship perspective, college life, friendships, or anything else. The acting is atrocious, as far as Baldwin and Boyle go. Charles redeems it a bit - but only a BIT. The situations are simply ridiculous. Statements are made, and then left hanging without culmination. Friendships are portrayed with an emptiness around them that is difficult to understand. Considering the writer is the director (Fleming), not much more could've been expected since the story itself is so awful. I saw the movie 'coz the actors are from my era, and I thought it would be nostalgic. Hardly - avoid it if you can.

    I started off watching this film with little hope of it being very good, but as the film went on, I found myself getting further sucked into the plot and relating with the characters. I usually hate romantic comedies but this film is different to the usual film from the genre - the characters were well developed - I felt like I really knew them and recognised them in people I actually know. The pacing was perfect - not too fast and I was able to get a real sense of what was going on. The plot completely believable too because of how it was presented, the themes of friendship and sexuality were well portrayed and not too rushed. The amount of comedy was perfect and I just generally really liked this film! However I would have liked to have seen more development of Eddy's character if I am brutally honest as I feel that him being gay should have played a bigger part in the film. Although, considering the time it was produced and released, it's safe to say that the film was pretty risky. I would love to see a more modern interpretation or remake.

    If this is what your college experience is supposed to be like, forget it. These type of films have nothing whatsoever to do with such an experience. To say that they have missed the true meaning of the college years is to put it mildly. Thank the Lord that Josh Charles grew up, matured and has landed the prime role of Will Gardner in "The Good Wife." This picture, to put it mildly, is the pits. What are we supposed to say, that it's the sexual coming out of a menage a trois? The whole concept was ridiculous at best. I think that the film would have been better off had Ms. Boyle not entered the film and the movie dealt with the exploits of two guys sharing a room, both of whom had absolutely nothing in common with each other. When will they make a movie that shows you the difficulty of college life insofar as academics?

    'Threesome' is one such film that you simply cannot overlook or avoid. Films like this are very rare to witness these days where the plot is very simplified and revolves around just three college friends and their self discoveries. Very, in fact very rare films focus on college life in such a close manner and this film is much more than just three college friends in a room. In brief, 'Threesome' is the perfect example of a simplified cinema with a neat and perfect execution in every sense, from the precise direction by Andrew Fleming to the brilliant performances by Josh Charles, Lara Boyle and Stephen Baldwin. Charles, Boyle and Baldwin deliver one of their very best performances here, easily giving you the impression that you are just witnessing three friends and not the actors. The chemistry between these three is very touching and strong enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, making you a part of their journey throughout the film. Its a film that gets better and better on repeated viewings, trust me you will never get enough of it, its really a ride. A 9.9 out of 10!

    (spoiler alert) Not that I actually think I'm going to reveal anything this time around, but this is my first review in awhile and I've just discovered that IMDb insists that you put a warning up here. Of all the movies I've seen, of all the films that I love, this would seem to be the one that's most misunderstood on here. For some reason a lot of people (even Stephen Baldwin, one of the stars in the thing who's since gotten religion, and is now disavowing the film) think this is some kind of soft-porn film. It isn't, not at all. So half the people, the ones that wanted it to be a porn film, are disappointed, and the other half, without even having bothered seeing the film, say that it's immoral. This isn't a porn film at all. It's about friendship. It's one of the most on-the-mark movies about friendship that I've ever seen. Is there sex involved? Yes, of course. In case you've never noticed, we (and every other critter on the planet) are sexual beings, it's an urge in all of us. And if anyone would actually watch the film and just pay attention, it isn't all about overcoming inhibitions and setting free your desires; by the end of the film it becomes apparent that there are prices to be paid. (Well, I guess that was a spoiler, of sorts. But what's with this "spoiler" thing, anyway? There isn't a film book in the world that discusses, say, "Psycho" without giving away the ending! Since when has it become so important to not say anything about the movie? Hell, "Threesome" is about two guys and a girl..."SHHH!!! You're spoiling it for me!" LOL) Anyway, it has a very witty yet believable script and wonderful performances by all the actors (including, I must add, one of the most erotic scenes I've ever seen in my life, the one in the library. This might not be porn, but Lara was hot as hell back then!) And, by the end (if you're paying attention, and not assuming or hoping that it was a porn film) you're left on this terribly moving bittersweet note. Times change, people move on. This was a wonderful movie (if misunderstood), much better than its immediate rival that came out around the same time, "Reality Bites." In the end, the thing that the film is truly about is how ephemeral things can be. It can't show you, vividly, how things can fall apart, it can't make you feel for them or what will happen to and between them without spending the first 80 or so minutes putting them together. After all of that, you realize the tragedy and frailty of friendships and loves. And, in the end, that is truly what the movie is about. And, in the end, that's what life is all about.

    Threesome (1994) *** (out of 4) Surprisingly effective comedy/drama about roommates Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) and Eddy (Josh Charles) whose lives turn upside down when Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) moves into their dorm room. At first the three don't hit it off but that quickly changes and soon Alex likes Eddy, Stuart likes Alex and Eddy like Stuart. I remember watching this thing when it first came out and while this viewing didn't live up to what I remembered, I was still surprised at how well it did hold up all these years later. I think the film, unlike many, tried to be serious about it's subject matter and the three relationships that eventually evolve over the running time. For the most part the film doesn't hit any false moments as you will really feel as if you are watching three different characters come into their own while at college when sex is running free. The screenplay by director Fleming does a nice job at developing all three characters and their relationships with one another. I think the film doesn't shy away from its subject and in the end we're greeting to quite a few dramatic moments as well as some very funny ones. I think the running joke about all the pizza being eaten could have been left out but I don't fault the film too much for this. The performances by the three leads are quite effective with both Boyle and Charles really shining in their roles. Both of them handles their roles perfectly well with Boyle nailing the confusion and frustration of her character and Charles really coming off well as someone who doesn't know who he is. Baldwin adds a lot of laughter as the sex hungry male.

    Threesome (1994) *** out of **** Directed by Andrew Fleming With Josh Charles, Lara Flynn Boyle, Stephen Baldwin Great comedy drama about three friends who share the room: Baldwin wants Boyle, Boyle wants Charles, Charles wants Baldwin. Strong, decent comedy about friendship, unrequited love and sex. Full of life and well executed. Is not excellent and nothing from another world, of course, but is nothing pretentious as much others. Spectacular performances by all.

    This is one seriously underrated movie. The humor is very clever and mature (compared to say, a Will Farrell style college movie). I love the narration by the Eddy character, it makes this movie so much more. He makes you really feel what he's feeling. All three characters take you on their journey of self discovery, a bit of sexual experimentation that often occurs while in college, and most of all - the painful truth about "How can someone be such a necessary part of one's life one moment, and simply vanish the next?" How true is that?! One should also note the amazing original score by Thomas Newman. He's composed music for a ton of other movies too such as American Beauty, Pay It Forward, Erin Brockovich - just to scratch the surface. I recently became obsessed with finding this music, that is NOT included on the Threesome soundtrack (although the non-original music on that CD is a great compilation, including U2's "Dancing Barefoot" - a phenomenal song). I found it just this week if anyone else has been going crazy trying to find this music. It's on the American Buffalo soundtrack. The first half of the CD the score for American Buffalo score (which is pretty mediocre), and the last half is the original score to Threesome! Anyway, I think all three characters are VERY well played by the actors, even Stephen Baldwin - although I'm sure the role of the obnoxious, sex-obsessed roommate was tailor-made for the guy at that time. I love his and all the characters, and wouldn't change a thing about how they contribute to the three-way relationship that's formed as well as the story line. This movie is also very believable, a quality I love and a quality that keeps me from watching overly melodramatic "classics" like Gone With the Wind. I just don't believe the characters in those types of movies! So if you saw Threesome before and only thought it was so-so, give it another chance. Try to see it with new eyes, and for the love of God, listen to the original music when you can catch it. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. The DVD offers a couple of alternate endings, but I like the one they ultimately chose best. So it's not the happiest of endings, it's an extremely realistic ending. I was left completely satisfied.

    I savor entertainment that explores relationships realistically, I delight in work that succeeds in portraying a group of friends who really look like they care for one another, I even feast on featherlight relationship comedies (if they appear sincere and heartfelt, which doesn't occur that often). What I don't indulge in are pointless, pretentious pieces of 'art', that consist of a contrived script and an excruciatingly bad acting ensemble. Unfortunately, the latter is what best summarizes this drivel involving one-dimensional cardboard characters twaddling about nothing at all. In many ways a relationship between three people is endlessly more interesting than the classic pair. Unfortunately for myself and all other viewers victim of witnessing this movie, the writer leaves all the intriguing and intelligent parts out and what we are left with is a pretty formulaic comedy about people who want what they can't have. Been there, seen that...utterly boring. I'd skip this one if I were you.

The dialog is as sharp and clever as anything you will hear anywhere. There is a scene where a naive girl, who has been brought to a threesome dinner party by one of the boys, flees the room in tears. Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) gives a raucous, malicious laugh and says, "I like her." It's a stunning moment, and drop dead funny. I hope this film eventually gets the attention it deserves. It is seriously neglected, certainly one of the most entertaining movies of its decade. In the gay community, this movie seems pretty much unknown. Which is a shame, because a gay audience would really get this movie.
