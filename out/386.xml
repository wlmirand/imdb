 <sinopse>
  A comical Gothic horror-movie-type family tries to rescue their beloved uncle from his gold-digging new love.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  On any day of the week, you could expect a newborn baby to be nurtured and loved by his older sister. Except, of course, if it's Wednesday. Pubert is the latest addition to the Addams family and, to prevent sibling rivalry escalating to fratricide, Wednesday and Pugsley are shipped off to summer camp and a nanny is hired. Debby Jellinsky is great with wrinkling baldies, which makes her the perfect nanny for Pubert and the unlikely wife of Uncle Fester. The question is..."Is she grave-digging or gold-digging?"

    *Spoiler/plot- Addams Family Values, 1993. It's love at first sight when Gomez and Morticia welcome their new baby son, Pubert. Fester falls in love for a voluptuous nanny taking care of their new baby son. The other two kids discover the nanny is a black-widow husband murderess who plans to kill Fester. The family future turns worse when the kids are shipped to summer camp. *Special Stars- Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack, Carole Kane, Christina Ricci. *Theme- Families are the best hedge against the cruel world. *Trivia/location/goofs- Most of the set wooden materials were of expensive oak, mahogany, and other rich and rare woods. Many parts of this film's sets were stored and for the film's proposed sequel. Due to Raul Julia untimely death the sequel never was produced. *Emotion- A thoroughly entertaining and loyal to the comic strip film that put the lead characters in some funny situations. The richness of the sets, costumes, and acting makes this film one for the video library. *Based On- Charles Addams comic strip.

    "The Addams Family Values" is a sequel to the 1991 movie "The Addams Family". As such, it doesn't really bother to introduce the characters any more but, as they are all pretty straightforward and were already part of the universal pop subconscious, this is for the best, avoiding repetition and letting us jump straight into the action. The problem is that discovering all those crazy personalities was what I preferred about the first movie; there is therefore less of a sense of macabre wonder this time around. Some will also find the plot to be too predictable but I didn't mind that much: there is a childish pleasure in anticipating what punishment is coming for the characters. Still, I would have loved to be surprised a bit more often. Thumbs up for the writers, who didn't hesitate to put a baby on the guillotine. I doubt this would still be possible nowadays in a family movie. And let's not forget Nina Ricci (Wednesday) Anjelica Huston (Morticia) and Raul Julia (Gomez) who are still excellent in their respective parts. Overall, "The Addams Family Values" is a worthy, if maybe slightly inferior, sequel. If you can summon the sleeping child inside you, it should provide good, simple entertainment.

    I have such happy memories of this movie. I saw it when it came out during the Christmas season of 1993. We had a Christmas Eve dinner at my new apartment, my first year on my own. The folks came over and after dinner some went home but my mom stayed and heard me describe the movie, which I had seen a few days earlier with friends. She thought it sounded hilarious and on a lark we went to see it right then and there. It had us both laughing almost non-stop. The film pokes fun at kids going to camp (a highlight), in-laws, dating, gold-diggers and the rivalry within families all to great effect. Watch for the "slideshow" scene towards the end...priceless. A gem.

    The cast is almost perfect, as even Christopher Lloyd has "grown" into the role of Fester, but something is still lacking in this better-than-the first sequel; a rare occurrence. "Pubert" is a great new character. He saves the ending of the film. his cannonball-Rube Goldberg-baby-saves-the-day sequence is brilliant. Sadly, there are too many movies made like this: A great beginning and ending with a "draggy" middle. Like the first film, too much time is spent on several non-Addams characters and locations. The summer camp sequence is good, (BBQ'd camp counselors, anyone?) but it seems out-of-place somehow, except for Wednesday's new creepy boyfriend. The atmosphere of the film seemed best at the Addam's Mansion, and not enough time is spent there in both films (even less here). There is no "Cleopatra plant" or exploding toy trains in this one. I wish a sequel had been made exploring the relatives in the graveyard; like a "haunted mansion" theme. I suppose another good sequel became impossible due to Raul Julia's untimely death. (I hear the totally-recast-straight-to-video 2nd sequel is dreadful--I have not seen it.) Back to what's missing in this second attempt: More visitors to the mansion. More for the supporting actors to do. A longer film. Also, the ending title "music" (rap-remix) is really bad. I would have used the original "Addams Theme". I doubt there will be another attempt to do this series. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as the "Bewitched" remake.

    One of the best comedies of all-time and one of my favorite comedies ever. This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called "The black widow" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the "Brady bunch" to "The sound of music" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    "Addams Family Values" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was "Grandmama," but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor. My Verdict: 7/10

    Addams Family Values is brilliantly funny. The premise is very unique: these Addams folk are a peculiar inversion of normal values, a sort of mirror-image of of standard morality. Everything that normal people like, they hate, and everything they like, we would find frightening or nasty. They are a perfect parody of evil. But they also have unlimited amounts of wealth, and that attracts a different kind of evil: real evil, the kind of real-world evil that real people have always had to contend with. And that's why this movie is not just brilliantly funny, but hilariously brilliant. Joan Cusack is marvelous as the evil nannie Debbie Jellinsky. She looks great doing it, and consequently she can almost be forgiven for her treatment of Uncle Fester. But no - the parody of evil created by the Addams family is an ethical mirror that shows the true nature of evil: the willingness to lie and harm others for selfish gain. Cusack's portrayal of the fair-seeming foulness of Debbie is wonderful. Side-splitting and heart-warming. 10/10

    At the end of the first film, the Addams' welcomed an addition to the family. as the film starts, there is just a bit of sibling rivalry going on between pugsley, Wednesday and the new little one Pubert. While their dastardly deeds are deterred, loving parents Morticia and Gomez send the little ones off to summer camp. Wednesday, again brilliantly played by Christina Ricci, has more of a summer camp nightmare when she stays true to herself and refuses to fit in is forced to watch Disney movies over and over. In a classic scene her and pugsley along with the other outcasts do a reinterpretation of the first Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile, the Addams hire a nanny, played by Joan Cusack, who seems a little too good to be true. Fester falls for the nanny but Wednesday seems to think there are alterior motives at play. Sequels aren't usually better than the first one and while this one isn't exactly better, it is still up to par with the first one with its own classic moments and great casting. Every now and then there is talk of another Addams movie, and for a while there was some on television with Tim Curry as Gomez. The untimely death of Raul Julia though takes away part of a great cast that is almost impossible to match.

    The Addams Family was a charming little television show that ran for a few seasons back in the early sixties. Based loosely on Charles Addams' cartoons from The New Yorker, the show was darkly comic, but rather tame by today's standards. This film retains the gist of the original series, but the characters and situations have been turned up to eleven (see This is Spinal Tap.) The characters that were originally sort of dark and odd are now murderous lunatics or sexual deviants or both. I love it. I happen to be a huge fan of black comedy and this film is a textbook example. Some of you will know that this is actually a sequel. I have both this film and the first, simply titled, The Addams Family. I must say that the first film, while funny, does not compare to this one. In Addams Family Values, Morticia (the mother) has another child. He is an adorably mustachioed baby by the name of Pubert. Since the kids (Wednesday and Pugsley) keep trying to kill the baby, mom and dad decide to hire a nanny. This nanny, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), has a secret: She gets rich men to marry her and then kills them, taking their fortunes. The rich bachelor she has her sights on this time is the lovable (yuck) Uncle Fester. The kids get wise to her scheme, so Debbie has them sent off to a way-too-cheery summer camp. Their only friend there is a neurotic little Jewish boy named Joel Glicker, who falls in love with Wednesday. Newly married to Fester, Debbie tries repeatedly to kill him. The freak is just too resilient, surviving many ridiculous and over-the-top murder attempts. There is one scene in this movie that has stuck with me ever since I first saw it as a small child. Little Corwin had a big crush on little Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. I was a weird kid. There was a scene where, after an escape attempt, the camp counselors decide that they have had enough of her. They stick Wednesday, Pugsley, and Joel in an insidious cabin: "The Harmony Hut." Inside, they are subjected to hours of Disney classics. When they come out, Wednesday has become *shudder* cheerful! She even does an extra-creepy smile. My biggest fear as a child was (and, in some ways, still is) being brainwashed or lobotomized; losing my sense of self. I remember being extremely freaked out by Charlton Heston's friend being lobotomized in Planet of the Apes. The thought of my girl, Wednesday, losing what I laughably refer to as her "humanity" affected my childhood drastically. Although I still enjoyed the odd Disney film (especially The Lion King and Toy Story), I was always wary of being affected by the saccharine animation. I was a Looney Tunes kid. The acting in this film is top-notch for its purposes. The actors absolutely know these characters, inside and out. Christina Ricci is great as a spooky little girl. Christopher Lloyd does socially retarded pervert better than anyone else. In my opinion, the real standout is the late, great Raul Julia as the father, Gomez Addams. His performance is completely over-the-top, in the best possible sense of the term. Just imagine a booming, theatrical voice and a trans-Atlantic accent for the following: "My name is Gomez Addams, and I have seen evil! I have seen horror! I have seen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark recesses of the human soul! I have seen all this, officer, but until today... I had never... seen... ... YOU!!!" To say that this film is cartoonish is an understatement. It's chock full of wacky characters and electric chairs. It even features a couple of literal pies to the face. It may just be a big cartoon, but at least it's a good cartoon. At the end of the day, I don't feel that I can ask for any more than this.

    deserves at least a 7 out of 10, while I surprisingly found out that the mark voted by average is so low. it's real funny, sarcastic and ridiculously true in some manners. you can certainly see that the action of forcing people to change from 'dark' side to 'brightness' while they do no harm being themselves is useless and sort of stupid. turning others to something else so they could 'fit in' is some kind of silly idea. I loved the scenes of the lads in the summer camp as well as the ones they tried to kill their younger brother just because they thought 'if a new child is born, one of the existences must go'. it was childish thought and it was sorta cute in the film. it is dark however not scary at all, which is why i like it a lot. being sick of those 'sunshine's and clich&eacute;, dull stories which try too hard to 'encourage' people to become strong or 'rise after fall', this can be fresh and of REAL fun.

The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called "The black widow" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the "Brady bunch" to "The sound of music" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    "Addams Family Values" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was "Grandmama," but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor. My Verdict: 7/10

    Addams Family Values is brilliantly funny. The premise is very unique: these Addams folk are a peculiar inversion of normal values, a sort of mirror-image of of standard morality. Everything that normal people like, they hate, and everything they like, we would find frightening or nasty. They are a perfect parody of evil. But they also have unlimited amounts of wealth, and that attracts a different kind of evil: real evil, the kind of real-world evil that real people have always had to contend with. And that's why this movie is not just brilliantly funny, but hilariously brilliant. Joan Cusack is marvelous as the evil nannie Debbie Jellinsky. She looks great doing it, and consequently she can almost be forgiven for her treatment of Uncle Fester. But no - the parody of evil created by the Addams family is an ethical mirror that shows the true nature of evil: the willingness to lie and harm others for selfish gain. Cusack's portrayal of the fair-seeming foulness of Debbie is wonderful. Side-splitting and heart-warming. 10/10

    At the end of the first film, the Addams' welcomed an addition to the family. as the film starts, there is just a bit of sibling rivalry going on between pugsley, Wednesday and the new little one Pubert. While their dastardly deeds are deterred, loving parents Morticia and Gomez send the little ones off to summer camp. Wednesday, again brilliantly played by Christina Ricci, has more of a summer camp nightmare when she stays true to herself and refuses to fit in is forced to watch Disney movies over and over. In a classic scene her and pugsley along with the other outcasts do a reinterpretation of the first Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile, the Addams hire a nanny, played by Joan Cusack, who seems a little too good to be true. Fester falls for the nanny but Wednesday seems to think there are alterior motives at play. Sequels aren't usually better than the first one and while this one isn't exactly better, it is still up to par with the first one with its own classic moments and great casting. Every now and then there is talk of another Addams movie, and for a while there was some on television with Tim Curry as Gomez. The untimely death of Raul Julia though takes away part of a great cast that is almost impossible to match.

    The Addams Family was a charming little television show that ran for a few seasons back in the early sixties. Based loosely on Charles Addams' cartoons from The New Yorker, the show was darkly comic, but rather tame by today's standards. This film retains the gist of the original series, but the characters and situations have been turned up to eleven (see This is Spinal Tap.) The characters that were originally sort of dark and odd are now murderous lunatics or sexual deviants or both. I love it. I happen to be a huge fan of black comedy and this film is a textbook example. Some of you will know that this is actually a sequel. I have both this film and the first, simply titled, The Addams Family. I must say that the first film, while funny, does not compare to this one. In Addams Family Values, Morticia (the mother) has another child. He is an adorably mustachioed baby by the name of Pubert. Since the kids (Wednesday and Pugsley) keep trying to kill the baby, mom and dad decide to hire a nanny. This nanny, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), has a secret: She gets rich men to marry her and then kills them, taking their fortunes. The rich bachelor she has her sights on this time is the lovable (yuck) Uncle Fester. The kids get wise to her scheme, so Debbie has them sent off to a way-too-cheery summer camp. Their only friend there is a neurotic little Jewish boy named Joel Glicker, who falls in love with Wednesday. Newly married to Fester, Debbie tries repeatedly to kill him. The freak is just too resilient, surviving many ridiculous and over-the-top murder attempts. There is one scene in this movie that has stuck with me ever since I first saw it as a small child. Little Corwin had a big crush on little Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. I was a weird kid. There was a scene where, after an escape attempt, the camp counselors decide that they have had enough of her. They stick Wednesday, Pugsley, and Joel in an insidious cabin: "The Harmony Hut." Inside, they are subjected to hours of Disney classics. When they come out, Wednesday has become *shudder* cheerful! She even does an extra-creepy smile. My biggest fear as a child was (and, in some ways, still is) being brainwashed or lobotomized; losing my sense of self. I remember being extremely freaked out by Charlton Heston's friend being lobotomized in Planet of the Apes. The thought of my girl, Wednesday, losing what I laughably refer to as her "humanity" affected my childhood drastically. Although I still enjoyed the odd Disney film (especially The Lion King and Toy Story), I was always wary of being affected by the saccharine animation. I was a Looney Tunes kid. The acting in this film is top-notch for its purposes. The actors absolutely know these characters, inside and out. Christina Ricci is great as a spooky little girl. Christopher Lloyd does socially retarded pervert better than anyone else. In my opinion, the real standout is the late, great Raul Julia as the father, Gomez Addams. His performance is completely over-the-top, in the best possible sense of the term. Just imagine a booming, theatrical voice and a trans-Atlantic accent for the following: "My name is Gomez Addams, and I have seen evil! I have seen horror! I have seen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark recesses of the human soul! I have seen all this, officer, but until today... I had never... seen... ... YOU!!!" To say that this film is cartoonish is an understatement. It's chock full of wacky characters and electric chairs. It even features a couple of literal pies to the face. It may just be a big cartoon, but at least it's a good cartoon. At the end of the day, I don't feel that I can ask for any more than this.

    deserves at least a 7 out of 10, while I surprisingly found out that the mark voted by average is so low. it's real funny, sarcastic and ridiculously true in some manners. you can certainly see that the action of forcing people to change from 'dark' side to 'brightness' while they do no harm being themselves is useless and sort of stupid. turning others to something else so they could 'fit in' is some kind of silly idea. I loved the scenes of the lads in the summer camp as well as the ones they tried to kill their younger brother just because they thought 'if a new child is born, one of the existences must go'. it was childish thought and it was sorta cute in the film. it is dark however not scary at all, which is why i like it a lot. being sick of those 'sunshine's and clich&eacute;, dull stories which try too hard to 'encourage' people to become strong or 'rise after fall', this can be fresh and of REAL fun.

    *Spoiler/plot- Addams Family Values, 1993. It's love at first sight when Gomez and Morticia welcome their new baby son, Pubert. Fester falls in love for a voluptuous nanny taking care of their new baby son. The other two kids discover the nanny is a black-widow husband murderess who plans to kill Fester. The family future turns worse when the kids are shipped to summer camp. *Special Stars- Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack, Carole Kane, Christina Ricci. *Theme- Families are the best hedge against the cruel world. *Trivia/location/goofs- Most of the set wooden materials were of expensive oak, mahogany, and other rich and rare woods. Many parts of this film's sets were stored and for the film's proposed sequel. Due to Raul Julia untimely death the sequel never was produced. *Emotion- A thoroughly entertaining and loyal to the comic strip film that put the lead characters in some funny situations. The richness of the sets, costumes, and acting makes this film one for the video library. *Based On- Charles Addams comic strip.

    "The Addams Family Values" is a sequel to the 1991 movie "The Addams Family". As such, it doesn't really bother to introduce the characters any more but, as they are all pretty straightforward and were already part of the universal pop subconscious, this is for the best, avoiding repetition and letting us jump straight into the action. The problem is that discovering all those crazy personalities was what I preferred about the first movie; there is therefore less of a sense of macabre wonder this time around. Some will also find the plot to be too predictable but I didn't mind that much: there is a childish pleasure in anticipating what punishment is coming for the characters. Still, I would have loved to be surprised a bit more often. Thumbs up for the writers, who didn't hesitate to put a baby on the guillotine. I doubt this would still be possible nowadays in a family movie. And let's not forget Nina Ricci (Wednesday) Anjelica Huston (Morticia) and Raul Julia (Gomez) who are still excellent in their respective parts. Overall, "The Addams Family Values" is a worthy, if maybe slightly inferior, sequel. If you can summon the sleeping child inside you, it should provide good, simple entertainment.

    I have such happy memories of this movie. I saw it when it came out during the Christmas season of 1993. We had a Christmas Eve dinner at my new apartment, my first year on my own. The folks came over and after dinner some went home but my mom stayed and heard me describe the movie, which I had seen a few days earlier with friends. She thought it sounded hilarious and on a lark we went to see it right then and there. It had us both laughing almost non-stop. The film pokes fun at kids going to camp (a highlight), in-laws, dating, gold-diggers and the rivalry within families all to great effect. Watch for the "slideshow" scene towards the end...priceless. A gem.

    The cast is almost perfect, as even Christopher Lloyd has "grown" into the role of Fester, but something is still lacking in this better-than-the first sequel; a rare occurrence. "Pubert" is a great new character. He saves the ending of the film. his cannonball-Rube Goldberg-baby-saves-the-day sequence is brilliant. Sadly, there are too many movies made like this: A great beginning and ending with a "draggy" middle. Like the first film, too much time is spent on several non-Addams characters and locations. The summer camp sequence is good, (BBQ'd camp counselors, anyone?) but it seems out-of-place somehow, except for Wednesday's new creepy boyfriend. The atmosphere of the film seemed best at the Addam's Mansion, and not enough time is spent there in both films (even less here). There is no "Cleopatra plant" or exploding toy trains in this one. I wish a sequel had been made exploring the relatives in the graveyard; like a "haunted mansion" theme. I suppose another good sequel became impossible due to Raul Julia's untimely death. (I hear the totally-recast-straight-to-video 2nd sequel is dreadful--I have not seen it.) Back to what's missing in this second attempt: More visitors to the mansion. More for the supporting actors to do. A longer film. Also, the ending title "music" (rap-remix) is really bad. I would have used the original "Addams Theme". I doubt there will be another attempt to do this series. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as the "Bewitched" remake.

    One of the best comedies of all-time and one of my favorite comedies ever. This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called "The black widow" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture.

A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    deserves at least a 7 out of 10, while I surprisingly found out that the mark voted by average is so low. it's real funny, sarcastic and ridiculously true in some manners. you can certainly see that the action of forcing people to change from 'dark' side to 'brightness' while they do no harm being themselves is useless and sort of stupid. turning others to something else so they could 'fit in' is some kind of silly idea. I loved the scenes of the lads in the summer camp as well as the ones they tried to kill their younger brother just because they thought 'if a new child is born, one of the existences must go'. it was childish thought and it was sorta cute in the film. it is dark however not scary at all, which is why i like it a lot. being sick of those 'sunshine's and clich&eacute;, dull stories which try too hard to 'encourage' people to become strong or 'rise after fall', this can be fresh and of REAL fun.

    *Spoiler/plot- Addams Family Values, 1993. It's love at first sight when Gomez and Morticia welcome their new baby son, Pubert. Fester falls in love for a voluptuous nanny taking care of their new baby son. The other two kids discover the nanny is a black-widow husband murderess who plans to kill Fester. The family future turns worse when the kids are shipped to summer camp. *Special Stars- Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack, Carole Kane, Christina Ricci. *Theme- Families are the best hedge against the cruel world. *Trivia/location/goofs- Most of the set wooden materials were of expensive oak, mahogany, and other rich and rare woods. Many parts of this film's sets were stored and for the film's proposed sequel. Due to Raul Julia untimely death the sequel never was produced. *Emotion- A thoroughly entertaining and loyal to the comic strip film that put the lead characters in some funny situations. The richness of the sets, costumes, and acting makes this film one for the video library. *Based On- Charles Addams comic strip.

    "The Addams Family Values" is a sequel to the 1991 movie "The Addams Family". As such, it doesn't really bother to introduce the characters any more but, as they are all pretty straightforward and were already part of the universal pop subconscious, this is for the best, avoiding repetition and letting us jump straight into the action. The problem is that discovering all those crazy personalities was what I preferred about the first movie; there is therefore less of a sense of macabre wonder this time around. Some will also find the plot to be too predictable but I didn't mind that much: there is a childish pleasure in anticipating what punishment is coming for the characters. Still, I would have loved to be surprised a bit more often. Thumbs up for the writers, who didn't hesitate to put a baby on the guillotine. I doubt this would still be possible nowadays in a family movie. And let's not forget Nina Ricci (Wednesday) Anjelica Huston (Morticia) and Raul Julia (Gomez) who are still excellent in their respective parts. Overall, "The Addams Family Values" is a worthy, if maybe slightly inferior, sequel. If you can summon the sleeping child inside you, it should provide good, simple entertainment.

    I have such happy memories of this movie. I saw it when it came out during the Christmas season of 1993. We had a Christmas Eve dinner at my new apartment, my first year on my own. The folks came over and after dinner some went home but my mom stayed and heard me describe the movie, which I had seen a few days earlier with friends. She thought it sounded hilarious and on a lark we went to see it right then and there. It had us both laughing almost non-stop. The film pokes fun at kids going to camp (a highlight), in-laws, dating, gold-diggers and the rivalry within families all to great effect. Watch for the "slideshow" scene towards the end...priceless. A gem.

    The cast is almost perfect, as even Christopher Lloyd has "grown" into the role of Fester, but something is still lacking in this better-than-the first sequel; a rare occurrence. "Pubert" is a great new character. He saves the ending of the film. his cannonball-Rube Goldberg-baby-saves-the-day sequence is brilliant. Sadly, there are too many movies made like this: A great beginning and ending with a "draggy" middle. Like the first film, too much time is spent on several non-Addams characters and locations. The summer camp sequence is good, (BBQ'd camp counselors, anyone?) but it seems out-of-place somehow, except for Wednesday's new creepy boyfriend. The atmosphere of the film seemed best at the Addam's Mansion, and not enough time is spent there in both films (even less here). There is no "Cleopatra plant" or exploding toy trains in this one. I wish a sequel had been made exploring the relatives in the graveyard; like a "haunted mansion" theme. I suppose another good sequel became impossible due to Raul Julia's untimely death. (I hear the totally-recast-straight-to-video 2nd sequel is dreadful--I have not seen it.) Back to what's missing in this second attempt: More visitors to the mansion. More for the supporting actors to do. A longer film. Also, the ending title "music" (rap-remix) is really bad. I would have used the original "Addams Theme". I doubt there will be another attempt to do this series. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as the "Bewitched" remake.

    One of the best comedies of all-time and one of my favorite comedies ever. This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called "The black widow" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the "Brady bunch" to "The sound of music" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    "Addams Family Values" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was "Grandmama," but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor. My Verdict: 7/10

    Addams Family Values is brilliantly funny. The premise is very unique: these Addams folk are a peculiar inversion of normal values, a sort of mirror-image of of standard morality. Everything that normal people like, they hate, and everything they like, we would find frightening or nasty. They are a perfect parody of evil. But they also have unlimited amounts of wealth, and that attracts a different kind of evil: real evil, the kind of real-world evil that real people have always had to contend with. And that's why this movie is not just brilliantly funny, but hilariously brilliant. Joan Cusack is marvelous as the evil nannie Debbie Jellinsky. She looks great doing it, and consequently she can almost be forgiven for her treatment of Uncle Fester. But no - the parody of evil created by the Addams family is an ethical mirror that shows the true nature of evil: the willingness to lie and harm others for selfish gain. Cusack's portrayal of the fair-seeming foulness of Debbie is wonderful. Side-splitting and heart-warming. 10/10

    At the end of the first film, the Addams' welcomed an addition to the family. as the film starts, there is just a bit of sibling rivalry going on between pugsley, Wednesday and the new little one Pubert. While their dastardly deeds are deterred, loving parents Morticia and Gomez send the little ones off to summer camp. Wednesday, again brilliantly played by Christina Ricci, has more of a summer camp nightmare when she stays true to herself and refuses to fit in is forced to watch Disney movies over and over. In a classic scene her and pugsley along with the other outcasts do a reinterpretation of the first Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile, the Addams hire a nanny, played by Joan Cusack, who seems a little too good to be true. Fester falls for the nanny but Wednesday seems to think there are alterior motives at play. Sequels aren't usually better than the first one and while this one isn't exactly better, it is still up to par with the first one with its own classic moments and great casting. Every now and then there is talk of another Addams movie, and for a while there was some on television with Tim Curry as Gomez. The untimely death of Raul Julia though takes away part of a great cast that is almost impossible to match.

    The Addams Family was a charming little television show that ran for a few seasons back in the early sixties. Based loosely on Charles Addams' cartoons from The New Yorker, the show was darkly comic, but rather tame by today's standards. This film retains the gist of the original series, but the characters and situations have been turned up to eleven (see This is Spinal Tap.) The characters that were originally sort of dark and odd are now murderous lunatics or sexual deviants or both. I love it. I happen to be a huge fan of black comedy and this film is a textbook example. Some of you will know that this is actually a sequel. I have both this film and the first, simply titled, The Addams Family. I must say that the first film, while funny, does not compare to this one. In Addams Family Values, Morticia (the mother) has another child. He is an adorably mustachioed baby by the name of Pubert. Since the kids (Wednesday and Pugsley) keep trying to kill the baby, mom and dad decide to hire a nanny. This nanny, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), has a secret: She gets rich men to marry her and then kills them, taking their fortunes. The rich bachelor she has her sights on this time is the lovable (yuck) Uncle Fester. The kids get wise to her scheme, so Debbie has them sent off to a way-too-cheery summer camp. Their only friend there is a neurotic little Jewish boy named Joel Glicker, who falls in love with Wednesday. Newly married to Fester, Debbie tries repeatedly to kill him. The freak is just too resilient, surviving many ridiculous and over-the-top murder attempts. There is one scene in this movie that has stuck with me ever since I first saw it as a small child. Little Corwin had a big crush on little Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. I was a weird kid. There was a scene where, after an escape attempt, the camp counselors decide that they have had enough of her. They stick Wednesday, Pugsley, and Joel in an insidious cabin: "The Harmony Hut." Inside, they are subjected to hours of Disney classics. When they come out, Wednesday has become *shudder* cheerful! She even does an extra-creepy smile. My biggest fear as a child was (and, in some ways, still is) being brainwashed or lobotomized; losing my sense of self. I remember being extremely freaked out by Charlton Heston's friend being lobotomized in Planet of the Apes. The thought of my girl, Wednesday, losing what I laughably refer to as her "humanity" affected my childhood drastically. Although I still enjoyed the odd Disney film (especially The Lion King and Toy Story), I was always wary of being affected by the saccharine animation. I was a Looney Tunes kid. The acting in this film is top-notch for its purposes. The actors absolutely know these characters, inside and out. Christina Ricci is great as a spooky little girl. Christopher Lloyd does socially retarded pervert better than anyone else. In my opinion, the real standout is the late, great Raul Julia as the father, Gomez Addams. His performance is completely over-the-top, in the best possible sense of the term. Just imagine a booming, theatrical voice and a trans-Atlantic accent for the following: "My name is Gomez Addams, and I have seen evil! I have seen horror! I have seen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark recesses of the human soul! I have seen all this, officer, but until today... I had never... seen... ... YOU!!!" To say that this film is cartoonish is an understatement. It's chock full of wacky characters and electric chairs. It even features a couple of literal pies to the face. It may just be a big cartoon, but at least it's a good cartoon. At the end of the day, I don't feel that I can ask for any more than this.

I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the "Brady bunch" to "The sound of music" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    "Addams Family Values" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was "Grandmama," but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor. My Verdict: 7/10

    Addams Family Values is brilliantly funny. The premise is very unique: these Addams folk are a peculiar inversion of normal values, a sort of mirror-image of of standard morality. Everything that normal people like, they hate, and everything they like, we would find frightening or nasty. They are a perfect parody of evil. But they also have unlimited amounts of wealth, and that attracts a different kind of evil: real evil, the kind of real-world evil that real people have always had to contend with. And that's why this movie is not just brilliantly funny, but hilariously brilliant. Joan Cusack is marvelous as the evil nannie Debbie Jellinsky. She looks great doing it, and consequently she can almost be forgiven for her treatment of Uncle Fester. But no - the parody of evil created by the Addams family is an ethical mirror that shows the true nature of evil: the willingness to lie and harm others for selfish gain. Cusack's portrayal of the fair-seeming foulness of Debbie is wonderful. Side-splitting and heart-warming. 10/10

    At the end of the first film, the Addams' welcomed an addition to the family. as the film starts, there is just a bit of sibling rivalry going on between pugsley, Wednesday and the new little one Pubert. While their dastardly deeds are deterred, loving parents Morticia and Gomez send the little ones off to summer camp. Wednesday, again brilliantly played by Christina Ricci, has more of a summer camp nightmare when she stays true to herself and refuses to fit in is forced to watch Disney movies over and over. In a classic scene her and pugsley along with the other outcasts do a reinterpretation of the first Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile, the Addams hire a nanny, played by Joan Cusack, who seems a little too good to be true. Fester falls for the nanny but Wednesday seems to think there are alterior motives at play. Sequels aren't usually better than the first one and while this one isn't exactly better, it is still up to par with the first one with its own classic moments and great casting. Every now and then there is talk of another Addams movie, and for a while there was some on television with Tim Curry as Gomez. The untimely death of Raul Julia though takes away part of a great cast that is almost impossible to match.

    The Addams Family was a charming little television show that ran for a few seasons back in the early sixties. Based loosely on Charles Addams' cartoons from The New Yorker, the show was darkly comic, but rather tame by today's standards. This film retains the gist of the original series, but the characters and situations have been turned up to eleven (see This is Spinal Tap.) The characters that were originally sort of dark and odd are now murderous lunatics or sexual deviants or both. I love it. I happen to be a huge fan of black comedy and this film is a textbook example. Some of you will know that this is actually a sequel. I have both this film and the first, simply titled, The Addams Family. I must say that the first film, while funny, does not compare to this one. In Addams Family Values, Morticia (the mother) has another child. He is an adorably mustachioed baby by the name of Pubert. Since the kids (Wednesday and Pugsley) keep trying to kill the baby, mom and dad decide to hire a nanny. This nanny, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), has a secret: She gets rich men to marry her and then kills them, taking their fortunes. The rich bachelor she has her sights on this time is the lovable (yuck) Uncle Fester. The kids get wise to her scheme, so Debbie has them sent off to a way-too-cheery summer camp. Their only friend there is a neurotic little Jewish boy named Joel Glicker, who falls in love with Wednesday. Newly married to Fester, Debbie tries repeatedly to kill him. The freak is just too resilient, surviving many ridiculous and over-the-top murder attempts. There is one scene in this movie that has stuck with me ever since I first saw it as a small child. Little Corwin had a big crush on little Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. I was a weird kid. There was a scene where, after an escape attempt, the camp counselors decide that they have had enough of her. They stick Wednesday, Pugsley, and Joel in an insidious cabin: "The Harmony Hut." Inside, they are subjected to hours of Disney classics. When they come out, Wednesday has become *shudder* cheerful! She even does an extra-creepy smile. My biggest fear as a child was (and, in some ways, still is) being brainwashed or lobotomized; losing my sense of self. I remember being extremely freaked out by Charlton Heston's friend being lobotomized in Planet of the Apes. The thought of my girl, Wednesday, losing what I laughably refer to as her "humanity" affected my childhood drastically. Although I still enjoyed the odd Disney film (especially The Lion King and Toy Story), I was always wary of being affected by the saccharine animation. I was a Looney Tunes kid. The acting in this film is top-notch for its purposes. The actors absolutely know these characters, inside and out. Christina Ricci is great as a spooky little girl. Christopher Lloyd does socially retarded pervert better than anyone else. In my opinion, the real standout is the late, great Raul Julia as the father, Gomez Addams. His performance is completely over-the-top, in the best possible sense of the term. Just imagine a booming, theatrical voice and a trans-Atlantic accent for the following: "My name is Gomez Addams, and I have seen evil! I have seen horror! I have seen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark recesses of the human soul! I have seen all this, officer, but until today... I had never... seen... ... YOU!!!" To say that this film is cartoonish is an understatement. It's chock full of wacky characters and electric chairs. It even features a couple of literal pies to the face. It may just be a big cartoon, but at least it's a good cartoon. At the end of the day, I don't feel that I can ask for any more than this.

    deserves at least a 7 out of 10, while I surprisingly found out that the mark voted by average is so low. it's real funny, sarcastic and ridiculously true in some manners. you can certainly see that the action of forcing people to change from 'dark' side to 'brightness' while they do no harm being themselves is useless and sort of stupid. turning others to something else so they could 'fit in' is some kind of silly idea. I loved the scenes of the lads in the summer camp as well as the ones they tried to kill their younger brother just because they thought 'if a new child is born, one of the existences must go'. it was childish thought and it was sorta cute in the film. it is dark however not scary at all, which is why i like it a lot. being sick of those 'sunshine's and clich&eacute;, dull stories which try too hard to 'encourage' people to become strong or 'rise after fall', this can be fresh and of REAL fun.

    *Spoiler/plot- Addams Family Values, 1993. It's love at first sight when Gomez and Morticia welcome their new baby son, Pubert. Fester falls in love for a voluptuous nanny taking care of their new baby son. The other two kids discover the nanny is a black-widow husband murderess who plans to kill Fester. The family future turns worse when the kids are shipped to summer camp. *Special Stars- Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack, Carole Kane, Christina Ricci. *Theme- Families are the best hedge against the cruel world. *Trivia/location/goofs- Most of the set wooden materials were of expensive oak, mahogany, and other rich and rare woods. Many parts of this film's sets were stored and for the film's proposed sequel. Due to Raul Julia untimely death the sequel never was produced. *Emotion- A thoroughly entertaining and loyal to the comic strip film that put the lead characters in some funny situations. The richness of the sets, costumes, and acting makes this film one for the video library. *Based On- Charles Addams comic strip.

    "The Addams Family Values" is a sequel to the 1991 movie "The Addams Family". As such, it doesn't really bother to introduce the characters any more but, as they are all pretty straightforward and were already part of the universal pop subconscious, this is for the best, avoiding repetition and letting us jump straight into the action. The problem is that discovering all those crazy personalities was what I preferred about the first movie; there is therefore less of a sense of macabre wonder this time around. Some will also find the plot to be too predictable but I didn't mind that much: there is a childish pleasure in anticipating what punishment is coming for the characters. Still, I would have loved to be surprised a bit more often. Thumbs up for the writers, who didn't hesitate to put a baby on the guillotine. I doubt this would still be possible nowadays in a family movie. And let's not forget Nina Ricci (Wednesday) Anjelica Huston (Morticia) and Raul Julia (Gomez) who are still excellent in their respective parts. Overall, "The Addams Family Values" is a worthy, if maybe slightly inferior, sequel. If you can summon the sleeping child inside you, it should provide good, simple entertainment.

    I have such happy memories of this movie. I saw it when it came out during the Christmas season of 1993. We had a Christmas Eve dinner at my new apartment, my first year on my own. The folks came over and after dinner some went home but my mom stayed and heard me describe the movie, which I had seen a few days earlier with friends. She thought it sounded hilarious and on a lark we went to see it right then and there. It had us both laughing almost non-stop. The film pokes fun at kids going to camp (a highlight), in-laws, dating, gold-diggers and the rivalry within families all to great effect. Watch for the "slideshow" scene towards the end...priceless. A gem.

    The cast is almost perfect, as even Christopher Lloyd has "grown" into the role of Fester, but something is still lacking in this better-than-the first sequel; a rare occurrence. "Pubert" is a great new character. He saves the ending of the film. his cannonball-Rube Goldberg-baby-saves-the-day sequence is brilliant. Sadly, there are too many movies made like this: A great beginning and ending with a "draggy" middle. Like the first film, too much time is spent on several non-Addams characters and locations. The summer camp sequence is good, (BBQ'd camp counselors, anyone?) but it seems out-of-place somehow, except for Wednesday's new creepy boyfriend. The atmosphere of the film seemed best at the Addam's Mansion, and not enough time is spent there in both films (even less here). There is no "Cleopatra plant" or exploding toy trains in this one. I wish a sequel had been made exploring the relatives in the graveyard; like a "haunted mansion" theme. I suppose another good sequel became impossible due to Raul Julia's untimely death. (I hear the totally-recast-straight-to-video 2nd sequel is dreadful--I have not seen it.) Back to what's missing in this second attempt: More visitors to the mansion. More for the supporting actors to do. A longer film. Also, the ending title "music" (rap-remix) is really bad. I would have used the original "Addams Theme". I doubt there will be another attempt to do this series. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as the "Bewitched" remake.

    One of the best comedies of all-time and one of my favorite comedies ever. This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called "The black widow" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the "Brady bunch" to "The sound of music" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    *Spoiler/plot- Addams Family Values, 1993. It's love at first sight when Gomez and Morticia welcome their new baby son, Pubert. Fester falls in love for a voluptuous nanny taking care of their new baby son. The other two kids discover the nanny is a black-widow husband murderess who plans to kill Fester. The family future turns worse when the kids are shipped to summer camp. *Special Stars- Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack, Carole Kane, Christina Ricci. *Theme- Families are the best hedge against the cruel world. *Trivia/location/goofs- Most of the set wooden materials were of expensive oak, mahogany, and other rich and rare woods. Many parts of this film's sets were stored and for the film's proposed sequel. Due to Raul Julia untimely death the sequel never was produced. *Emotion- A thoroughly entertaining and loyal to the comic strip film that put the lead characters in some funny situations. The richness of the sets, costumes, and acting makes this film one for the video library. *Based On- Charles Addams comic strip.

    "The Addams Family Values" is a sequel to the 1991 movie "The Addams Family". As such, it doesn't really bother to introduce the characters any more but, as they are all pretty straightforward and were already part of the universal pop subconscious, this is for the best, avoiding repetition and letting us jump straight into the action. The problem is that discovering all those crazy personalities was what I preferred about the first movie; there is therefore less of a sense of macabre wonder this time around. Some will also find the plot to be too predictable but I didn't mind that much: there is a childish pleasure in anticipating what punishment is coming for the characters. Still, I would have loved to be surprised a bit more often. Thumbs up for the writers, who didn't hesitate to put a baby on the guillotine. I doubt this would still be possible nowadays in a family movie. And let's not forget Nina Ricci (Wednesday) Anjelica Huston (Morticia) and Raul Julia (Gomez) who are still excellent in their respective parts. Overall, "The Addams Family Values" is a worthy, if maybe slightly inferior, sequel. If you can summon the sleeping child inside you, it should provide good, simple entertainment.

    I have such happy memories of this movie. I saw it when it came out during the Christmas season of 1993. We had a Christmas Eve dinner at my new apartment, my first year on my own. The folks came over and after dinner some went home but my mom stayed and heard me describe the movie, which I had seen a few days earlier with friends. She thought it sounded hilarious and on a lark we went to see it right then and there. It had us both laughing almost non-stop. The film pokes fun at kids going to camp (a highlight), in-laws, dating, gold-diggers and the rivalry within families all to great effect. Watch for the "slideshow" scene towards the end...priceless. A gem.

    The cast is almost perfect, as even Christopher Lloyd has "grown" into the role of Fester, but something is still lacking in this better-than-the first sequel; a rare occurrence. "Pubert" is a great new character. He saves the ending of the film. his cannonball-Rube Goldberg-baby-saves-the-day sequence is brilliant. Sadly, there are too many movies made like this: A great beginning and ending with a "draggy" middle. Like the first film, too much time is spent on several non-Addams characters and locations. The summer camp sequence is good, (BBQ'd camp counselors, anyone?) but it seems out-of-place somehow, except for Wednesday's new creepy boyfriend. The atmosphere of the film seemed best at the Addam's Mansion, and not enough time is spent there in both films (even less here). There is no "Cleopatra plant" or exploding toy trains in this one. I wish a sequel had been made exploring the relatives in the graveyard; like a "haunted mansion" theme. I suppose another good sequel became impossible due to Raul Julia's untimely death. (I hear the totally-recast-straight-to-video 2nd sequel is dreadful--I have not seen it.) Back to what's missing in this second attempt: More visitors to the mansion. More for the supporting actors to do. A longer film. Also, the ending title "music" (rap-remix) is really bad. I would have used the original "Addams Theme". I doubt there will be another attempt to do this series. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as the "Bewitched" remake.

    One of the best comedies of all-time and one of my favorite comedies ever. This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called "The black widow" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the "Brady bunch" to "The sound of music" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    "Addams Family Values" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was "Grandmama," but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor. My Verdict: 7/10

    Addams Family Values is brilliantly funny. The premise is very unique: these Addams folk are a peculiar inversion of normal values, a sort of mirror-image of of standard morality. Everything that normal people like, they hate, and everything they like, we would find frightening or nasty. They are a perfect parody of evil. But they also have unlimited amounts of wealth, and that attracts a different kind of evil: real evil, the kind of real-world evil that real people have always had to contend with. And that's why this movie is not just brilliantly funny, but hilariously brilliant. Joan Cusack is marvelous as the evil nannie Debbie Jellinsky. She looks great doing it, and consequently she can almost be forgiven for her treatment of Uncle Fester. But no - the parody of evil created by the Addams family is an ethical mirror that shows the true nature of evil: the willingness to lie and harm others for selfish gain. Cusack's portrayal of the fair-seeming foulness of Debbie is wonderful. Side-splitting and heart-warming. 10/10

    At the end of the first film, the Addams' welcomed an addition to the family. as the film starts, there is just a bit of sibling rivalry going on between pugsley, Wednesday and the new little one Pubert. While their dastardly deeds are deterred, loving parents Morticia and Gomez send the little ones off to summer camp. Wednesday, again brilliantly played by Christina Ricci, has more of a summer camp nightmare when she stays true to herself and refuses to fit in is forced to watch Disney movies over and over. In a classic scene her and pugsley along with the other outcasts do a reinterpretation of the first Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile, the Addams hire a nanny, played by Joan Cusack, who seems a little too good to be true. Fester falls for the nanny but Wednesday seems to think there are alterior motives at play. Sequels aren't usually better than the first one and while this one isn't exactly better, it is still up to par with the first one with its own classic moments and great casting. Every now and then there is talk of another Addams movie, and for a while there was some on television with Tim Curry as Gomez. The untimely death of Raul Julia though takes away part of a great cast that is almost impossible to match.

    The Addams Family was a charming little television show that ran for a few seasons back in the early sixties. Based loosely on Charles Addams' cartoons from The New Yorker, the show was darkly comic, but rather tame by today's standards. This film retains the gist of the original series, but the characters and situations have been turned up to eleven (see This is Spinal Tap.) The characters that were originally sort of dark and odd are now murderous lunatics or sexual deviants or both. I love it. I happen to be a huge fan of black comedy and this film is a textbook example. Some of you will know that this is actually a sequel. I have both this film and the first, simply titled, The Addams Family. I must say that the first film, while funny, does not compare to this one. In Addams Family Values, Morticia (the mother) has another child. He is an adorably mustachioed baby by the name of Pubert. Since the kids (Wednesday and Pugsley) keep trying to kill the baby, mom and dad decide to hire a nanny. This nanny, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), has a secret: She gets rich men to marry her and then kills them, taking their fortunes. The rich bachelor she has her sights on this time is the lovable (yuck) Uncle Fester. The kids get wise to her scheme, so Debbie has them sent off to a way-too-cheery summer camp. Their only friend there is a neurotic little Jewish boy named Joel Glicker, who falls in love with Wednesday. Newly married to Fester, Debbie tries repeatedly to kill him. The freak is just too resilient, surviving many ridiculous and over-the-top murder attempts. There is one scene in this movie that has stuck with me ever since I first saw it as a small child. Little Corwin had a big crush on little Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. I was a weird kid. There was a scene where, after an escape attempt, the camp counselors decide that they have had enough of her. They stick Wednesday, Pugsley, and Joel in an insidious cabin: "The Harmony Hut." Inside, they are subjected to hours of Disney classics. When they come out, Wednesday has become *shudder* cheerful! She even does an extra-creepy smile. My biggest fear as a child was (and, in some ways, still is) being brainwashed or lobotomized; losing my sense of self. I remember being extremely freaked out by Charlton Heston's friend being lobotomized in Planet of the Apes. The thought of my girl, Wednesday, losing what I laughably refer to as her "humanity" affected my childhood drastically. Although I still enjoyed the odd Disney film (especially The Lion King and Toy Story), I was always wary of being affected by the saccharine animation. I was a Looney Tunes kid. The acting in this film is top-notch for its purposes. The actors absolutely know these characters, inside and out. Christina Ricci is great as a spooky little girl. Christopher Lloyd does socially retarded pervert better than anyone else. In my opinion, the real standout is the late, great Raul Julia as the father, Gomez Addams. His performance is completely over-the-top, in the best possible sense of the term. Just imagine a booming, theatrical voice and a trans-Atlantic accent for the following: "My name is Gomez Addams, and I have seen evil! I have seen horror! I have seen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark recesses of the human soul! I have seen all this, officer, but until today... I had never... seen... ... YOU!!!" To say that this film is cartoonish is an understatement. It's chock full of wacky characters and electric chairs. It even features a couple of literal pies to the face. It may just be a big cartoon, but at least it's a good cartoon. At the end of the day, I don't feel that I can ask for any more than this.

    deserves at least a 7 out of 10, while I surprisingly found out that the mark voted by average is so low. it's real funny, sarcastic and ridiculously true in some manners. you can certainly see that the action of forcing people to change from 'dark' side to 'brightness' while they do no harm being themselves is useless and sort of stupid. turning others to something else so they could 'fit in' is some kind of silly idea. I loved the scenes of the lads in the summer camp as well as the ones they tried to kill their younger brother just because they thought 'if a new child is born, one of the existences must go'. it was childish thought and it was sorta cute in the film. it is dark however not scary at all, which is why i like it a lot. being sick of those 'sunshine's and clich&eacute;, dull stories which try too hard to 'encourage' people to become strong or 'rise after fall', this can be fresh and of REAL fun.

A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    "Addams Family Values" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was "Grandmama," but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor. My Verdict: 7/10

    Addams Family Values is brilliantly funny. The premise is very unique: these Addams folk are a peculiar inversion of normal values, a sort of mirror-image of of standard morality. Everything that normal people like, they hate, and everything they like, we would find frightening or nasty. They are a perfect parody of evil. But they also have unlimited amounts of wealth, and that attracts a different kind of evil: real evil, the kind of real-world evil that real people have always had to contend with. And that's why this movie is not just brilliantly funny, but hilariously brilliant. Joan Cusack is marvelous as the evil nannie Debbie Jellinsky. She looks great doing it, and consequently she can almost be forgiven for her treatment of Uncle Fester. But no - the parody of evil created by the Addams family is an ethical mirror that shows the true nature of evil: the willingness to lie and harm others for selfish gain. Cusack's portrayal of the fair-seeming foulness of Debbie is wonderful. Side-splitting and heart-warming. 10/10

    At the end of the first film, the Addams' welcomed an addition to the family. as the film starts, there is just a bit of sibling rivalry going on between pugsley, Wednesday and the new little one Pubert. While their dastardly deeds are deterred, loving parents Morticia and Gomez send the little ones off to summer camp. Wednesday, again brilliantly played by Christina Ricci, has more of a summer camp nightmare when she stays true to herself and refuses to fit in is forced to watch Disney movies over and over. In a classic scene her and pugsley along with the other outcasts do a reinterpretation of the first Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile, the Addams hire a nanny, played by Joan Cusack, who seems a little too good to be true. Fester falls for the nanny but Wednesday seems to think there are alterior motives at play. Sequels aren't usually better than the first one and while this one isn't exactly better, it is still up to par with the first one with its own classic moments and great casting. Every now and then there is talk of another Addams movie, and for a while there was some on television with Tim Curry as Gomez. The untimely death of Raul Julia though takes away part of a great cast that is almost impossible to match.

    The Addams Family was a charming little television show that ran for a few seasons back in the early sixties. Based loosely on Charles Addams' cartoons from The New Yorker, the show was darkly comic, but rather tame by today's standards. This film retains the gist of the original series, but the characters and situations have been turned up to eleven (see This is Spinal Tap.) The characters that were originally sort of dark and odd are now murderous lunatics or sexual deviants or both. I love it. I happen to be a huge fan of black comedy and this film is a textbook example. Some of you will know that this is actually a sequel. I have both this film and the first, simply titled, The Addams Family. I must say that the first film, while funny, does not compare to this one. In Addams Family Values, Morticia (the mother) has another child. He is an adorably mustachioed baby by the name of Pubert. Since the kids (Wednesday and Pugsley) keep trying to kill the baby, mom and dad decide to hire a nanny. This nanny, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), has a secret: She gets rich men to marry her and then kills them, taking their fortunes. The rich bachelor she has her sights on this time is the lovable (yuck) Uncle Fester. The kids get wise to her scheme, so Debbie has them sent off to a way-too-cheery summer camp. Their only friend there is a neurotic little Jewish boy named Joel Glicker, who falls in love with Wednesday. Newly married to Fester, Debbie tries repeatedly to kill him. The freak is just too resilient, surviving many ridiculous and over-the-top murder attempts. There is one scene in this movie that has stuck with me ever since I first saw it as a small child. Little Corwin had a big crush on little Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. I was a weird kid. There was a scene where, after an escape attempt, the camp counselors decide that they have had enough of her. They stick Wednesday, Pugsley, and Joel in an insidious cabin: "The Harmony Hut." Inside, they are subjected to hours of Disney classics. When they come out, Wednesday has become *shudder* cheerful! She even does an extra-creepy smile. My biggest fear as a child was (and, in some ways, still is) being brainwashed or lobotomized; losing my sense of self. I remember being extremely freaked out by Charlton Heston's friend being lobotomized in Planet of the Apes. The thought of my girl, Wednesday, losing what I laughably refer to as her "humanity" affected my childhood drastically. Although I still enjoyed the odd Disney film (especially The Lion King and Toy Story), I was always wary of being affected by the saccharine animation. I was a Looney Tunes kid. The acting in this film is top-notch for its purposes. The actors absolutely know these characters, inside and out. Christina Ricci is great as a spooky little girl. Christopher Lloyd does socially retarded pervert better than anyone else. In my opinion, the real standout is the late, great Raul Julia as the father, Gomez Addams. His performance is completely over-the-top, in the best possible sense of the term. Just imagine a booming, theatrical voice and a trans-Atlantic accent for the following: "My name is Gomez Addams, and I have seen evil! I have seen horror! I have seen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark recesses of the human soul! I have seen all this, officer, but until today... I had never... seen... ... YOU!!!" To say that this film is cartoonish is an understatement. It's chock full of wacky characters and electric chairs. It even features a couple of literal pies to the face. It may just be a big cartoon, but at least it's a good cartoon. At the end of the day, I don't feel that I can ask for any more than this.

    deserves at least a 7 out of 10, while I surprisingly found out that the mark voted by average is so low. it's real funny, sarcastic and ridiculously true in some manners. you can certainly see that the action of forcing people to change from 'dark' side to 'brightness' while they do no harm being themselves is useless and sort of stupid. turning others to something else so they could 'fit in' is some kind of silly idea. I loved the scenes of the lads in the summer camp as well as the ones they tried to kill their younger brother just because they thought 'if a new child is born, one of the existences must go'. it was childish thought and it was sorta cute in the film. it is dark however not scary at all, which is why i like it a lot. being sick of those 'sunshine's and clich&eacute;, dull stories which try too hard to 'encourage' people to become strong or 'rise after fall', this can be fresh and of REAL fun.

    *Spoiler/plot- Addams Family Values, 1993. It's love at first sight when Gomez and Morticia welcome their new baby son, Pubert. Fester falls in love for a voluptuous nanny taking care of their new baby son. The other two kids discover the nanny is a black-widow husband murderess who plans to kill Fester. The family future turns worse when the kids are shipped to summer camp. *Special Stars- Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack, Carole Kane, Christina Ricci. *Theme- Families are the best hedge against the cruel world. *Trivia/location/goofs- Most of the set wooden materials were of expensive oak, mahogany, and other rich and rare woods. Many parts of this film's sets were stored and for the film's proposed sequel. Due to Raul Julia untimely death the sequel never was produced. *Emotion- A thoroughly entertaining and loyal to the comic strip film that put the lead characters in some funny situations. The richness of the sets, costumes, and acting makes this film one for the video library. *Based On- Charles Addams comic strip.

    "The Addams Family Values" is a sequel to the 1991 movie "The Addams Family". As such, it doesn't really bother to introduce the characters any more but, as they are all pretty straightforward and were already part of the universal pop subconscious, this is for the best, avoiding repetition and letting us jump straight into the action. The problem is that discovering all those crazy personalities was what I preferred about the first movie; there is therefore less of a sense of macabre wonder this time around. Some will also find the plot to be too predictable but I didn't mind that much: there is a childish pleasure in anticipating what punishment is coming for the characters. Still, I would have loved to be surprised a bit more often. Thumbs up for the writers, who didn't hesitate to put a baby on the guillotine. I doubt this would still be possible nowadays in a family movie. And let's not forget Nina Ricci (Wednesday) Anjelica Huston (Morticia) and Raul Julia (Gomez) who are still excellent in their respective parts. Overall, "The Addams Family Values" is a worthy, if maybe slightly inferior, sequel. If you can summon the sleeping child inside you, it should provide good, simple entertainment.

    I have such happy memories of this movie. I saw it when it came out during the Christmas season of 1993. We had a Christmas Eve dinner at my new apartment, my first year on my own. The folks came over and after dinner some went home but my mom stayed and heard me describe the movie, which I had seen a few days earlier with friends. She thought it sounded hilarious and on a lark we went to see it right then and there. It had us both laughing almost non-stop. The film pokes fun at kids going to camp (a highlight), in-laws, dating, gold-diggers and the rivalry within families all to great effect. Watch for the "slideshow" scene towards the end...priceless. A gem.

    The cast is almost perfect, as even Christopher Lloyd has "grown" into the role of Fester, but something is still lacking in this better-than-the first sequel; a rare occurrence. "Pubert" is a great new character. He saves the ending of the film. his cannonball-Rube Goldberg-baby-saves-the-day sequence is brilliant. Sadly, there are too many movies made like this: A great beginning and ending with a "draggy" middle. Like the first film, too much time is spent on several non-Addams characters and locations. The summer camp sequence is good, (BBQ'd camp counselors, anyone?) but it seems out-of-place somehow, except for Wednesday's new creepy boyfriend. The atmosphere of the film seemed best at the Addam's Mansion, and not enough time is spent there in both films (even less here). There is no "Cleopatra plant" or exploding toy trains in this one. I wish a sequel had been made exploring the relatives in the graveyard; like a "haunted mansion" theme. I suppose another good sequel became impossible due to Raul Julia's untimely death. (I hear the totally-recast-straight-to-video 2nd sequel is dreadful--I have not seen it.) Back to what's missing in this second attempt: More visitors to the mansion. More for the supporting actors to do. A longer film. Also, the ending title "music" (rap-remix) is really bad. I would have used the original "Addams Theme". I doubt there will be another attempt to do this series. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as the "Bewitched" remake.

    One of the best comedies of all-time and one of my favorite comedies ever. This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called "The black widow" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the "Brady bunch" to "The sound of music" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

The richness of the sets, costumes, and acting makes this film one for the video library. *Based On- Charles Addams comic strip.

    "The Addams Family Values" is a sequel to the 1991 movie "The Addams Family". As such, it doesn't really bother to introduce the characters any more but, as they are all pretty straightforward and were already part of the universal pop subconscious, this is for the best, avoiding repetition and letting us jump straight into the action. The problem is that discovering all those crazy personalities was what I preferred about the first movie; there is therefore less of a sense of macabre wonder this time around. Some will also find the plot to be too predictable but I didn't mind that much: there is a childish pleasure in anticipating what punishment is coming for the characters. Still, I would have loved to be surprised a bit more often. Thumbs up for the writers, who didn't hesitate to put a baby on the guillotine. I doubt this would still be possible nowadays in a family movie. And let's not forget Nina Ricci (Wednesday) Anjelica Huston (Morticia) and Raul Julia (Gomez) who are still excellent in their respective parts. Overall, "The Addams Family Values" is a worthy, if maybe slightly inferior, sequel. If you can summon the sleeping child inside you, it should provide good, simple entertainment.

    I have such happy memories of this movie. I saw it when it came out during the Christmas season of 1993. We had a Christmas Eve dinner at my new apartment, my first year on my own. The folks came over and after dinner some went home but my mom stayed and heard me describe the movie, which I had seen a few days earlier with friends. She thought it sounded hilarious and on a lark we went to see it right then and there. It had us both laughing almost non-stop. The film pokes fun at kids going to camp (a highlight), in-laws, dating, gold-diggers and the rivalry within families all to great effect. Watch for the "slideshow" scene towards the end...priceless. A gem.

    The cast is almost perfect, as even Christopher Lloyd has "grown" into the role of Fester, but something is still lacking in this better-than-the first sequel; a rare occurrence. "Pubert" is a great new character. He saves the ending of the film. his cannonball-Rube Goldberg-baby-saves-the-day sequence is brilliant. Sadly, there are too many movies made like this: A great beginning and ending with a "draggy" middle. Like the first film, too much time is spent on several non-Addams characters and locations. The summer camp sequence is good, (BBQ'd camp counselors, anyone?) but it seems out-of-place somehow, except for Wednesday's new creepy boyfriend. The atmosphere of the film seemed best at the Addam's Mansion, and not enough time is spent there in both films (even less here). There is no "Cleopatra plant" or exploding toy trains in this one. I wish a sequel had been made exploring the relatives in the graveyard; like a "haunted mansion" theme. I suppose another good sequel became impossible due to Raul Julia's untimely death. (I hear the totally-recast-straight-to-video 2nd sequel is dreadful--I have not seen it.) Back to what's missing in this second attempt: More visitors to the mansion. More for the supporting actors to do. A longer film. Also, the ending title "music" (rap-remix) is really bad. I would have used the original "Addams Theme". I doubt there will be another attempt to do this series. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as the "Bewitched" remake.

    One of the best comedies of all-time and one of my favorite comedies ever. This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called "The black widow" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the "Brady bunch" to "The sound of music" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.

    "Addams Family Values" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was "Grandmama," but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor. My Verdict: 7/10

    Addams Family Values is brilliantly funny. The premise is very unique: these Addams folk are a peculiar inversion of normal values, a sort of mirror-image of of standard morality. Everything that normal people like, they hate, and everything they like, we would find frightening or nasty. They are a perfect parody of evil. But they also have unlimited amounts of wealth, and that attracts a different kind of evil: real evil, the kind of real-world evil that real people have always had to contend with. And that's why this movie is not just brilliantly funny, but hilariously brilliant. Joan Cusack is marvelous as the evil nannie Debbie Jellinsky. She looks great doing it, and consequently she can almost be forgiven for her treatment of Uncle Fester. But no - the parody of evil created by the Addams family is an ethical mirror that shows the true nature of evil: the willingness to lie and harm others for selfish gain. Cusack's portrayal of the fair-seeming foulness of Debbie is wonderful. Side-splitting and heart-warming. 10/10

    At the end of the first film, the Addams' welcomed an addition to the family. as the film starts, there is just a bit of sibling rivalry going on between pugsley, Wednesday and the new little one Pubert. While their dastardly deeds are deterred, loving parents Morticia and Gomez send the little ones off to summer camp. Wednesday, again brilliantly played by Christina Ricci, has more of a summer camp nightmare when she stays true to herself and refuses to fit in is forced to watch Disney movies over and over. In a classic scene her and pugsley along with the other outcasts do a reinterpretation of the first Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile, the Addams hire a nanny, played by Joan Cusack, who seems a little too good to be true. Fester falls for the nanny but Wednesday seems to think there are alterior motives at play. Sequels aren't usually better than the first one and while this one isn't exactly better, it is still up to par with the first one with its own classic moments and great casting. Every now and then there is talk of another Addams movie, and for a while there was some on television with Tim Curry as Gomez. The untimely death of Raul Julia though takes away part of a great cast that is almost impossible to match.

    The Addams Family was a charming little television show that ran for a few seasons back in the early sixties. Based loosely on Charles Addams' cartoons from The New Yorker, the show was darkly comic, but rather tame by today's standards. This film retains the gist of the original series, but the characters and situations have been turned up to eleven (see This is Spinal Tap.) The characters that were originally sort of dark and odd are now murderous lunatics or sexual deviants or both. I love it. I happen to be a huge fan of black comedy and this film is a textbook example. Some of you will know that this is actually a sequel. I have both this film and the first, simply titled, The Addams Family. I must say that the first film, while funny, does not compare to this one. In Addams Family Values, Morticia (the mother) has another child. He is an adorably mustachioed baby by the name of Pubert. Since the kids (Wednesday and Pugsley) keep trying to kill the baby, mom and dad decide to hire a nanny. This nanny, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), has a secret: She gets rich men to marry her and then kills them, taking their fortunes. The rich bachelor she has her sights on this time is the lovable (yuck) Uncle Fester. The kids get wise to her scheme, so Debbie has them sent off to a way-too-cheery summer camp. Their only friend there is a neurotic little Jewish boy named Joel Glicker, who falls in love with Wednesday. Newly married to Fester, Debbie tries repeatedly to kill him. The freak is just too resilient, surviving many ridiculous and over-the-top murder attempts. There is one scene in this movie that has stuck with me ever since I first saw it as a small child. Little Corwin had a big crush on little Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. I was a weird kid. There was a scene where, after an escape attempt, the camp counselors decide that they have had enough of her. They stick Wednesday, Pugsley, and Joel in an insidious cabin: "The Harmony Hut." Inside, they are subjected to hours of Disney classics. When they come out, Wednesday has become *shudder* cheerful! She even does an extra-creepy smile. My biggest fear as a child was (and, in some ways, still is) being brainwashed or lobotomized; losing my sense of self. I remember being extremely freaked out by Charlton Heston's friend being lobotomized in Planet of the Apes. The thought of my girl, Wednesday, losing what I laughably refer to as her "humanity" affected my childhood drastically. Although I still enjoyed the odd Disney film (especially The Lion King and Toy Story), I was always wary of being affected by the saccharine animation. I was a Looney Tunes kid. The acting in this film is top-notch for its purposes. The actors absolutely know these characters, inside and out. Christina Ricci is great as a spooky little girl. Christopher Lloyd does socially retarded pervert better than anyone else. In my opinion, the real standout is the late, great Raul Julia as the father, Gomez Addams. His performance is completely over-the-top, in the best possible sense of the term. Just imagine a booming, theatrical voice and a trans-Atlantic accent for the following: "My name is Gomez Addams, and I have seen evil! I have seen horror! I have seen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark recesses of the human soul! I have seen all this, officer, but until today... I had never... seen... ... YOU!!!" To say that this film is cartoonish is an understatement. It's chock full of wacky characters and electric chairs. It even features a couple of literal pies to the face. It may just be a big cartoon, but at least it's a good cartoon. At the end of the day, I don't feel that I can ask for any more than this.

    deserves at least a 7 out of 10, while I surprisingly found out that the mark voted by average is so low. it's real funny, sarcastic and ridiculously true in some manners. you can certainly see that the action of forcing people to change from 'dark' side to 'brightness' while they do no harm being themselves is useless and sort of stupid. turning others to something else so they could 'fit in' is some kind of silly idea. I loved the scenes of the lads in the summer camp as well as the ones they tried to kill their younger brother just because they thought 'if a new child is born, one of the existences must go'. it was childish thought and it was sorta cute in the film. it is dark however not scary at all, which is why i like it a lot. being sick of those 'sunshine's and clich&eacute;, dull stories which try too hard to 'encourage' people to become strong or 'rise after fall', this can be fresh and of REAL fun.
