    A young woman in 1930s England tries to mooch off her relatives as she gathers material for her future career as a writer. This is meant to be a spoof of the novels of such writers as Dickens and Austen. It is described as a comedy, and the way the actors deliver their lines certainly suggests that the dialog is dripping with wit. The only problem is that there is nary a single chuckle to be had from the humorless script. With hardly a plot to hold one's interest, it soon turns into a dreary bore. It is based on a popular comic novel from the 1930s; hence the humor is either dated or the screenplay does not do justice to the novel. It's a shame because it has a good cast that seems to be really trying.

    Loved this movie. Loved the book and was totally impressed with how they adapted it, nothing was lost. The story is simple: Set in England, sometime around the 1930's - a young woman, Flora Post, is left with a very small annuity after her parents die. She needs to either find a suitable job, or find some suitable relative with whom to live. After she sends out enquiries to a number of relatives and receives responses, she decides to go to her country cousins, the Starkadders. Flora has no qualms about setting off on this adventure, but her cousins have NO idea of what they have let themselves in for. We join her on her adventures and are completely sucked into the story and the surroundings. Nothing defies her, nothing worries her, she sails through the lives and routines, gloom and joy of her cousins and their associates with the greatest of ease and comfort. Flora loves to organize things, and she relentlessly creates order from chaos at Starkadder Farm, in a charming way. There is so much to love about the story itself which is lightheartedly and gently making fund of a certain time in British history. The acting is amazing, the casting is incredible. The pacing of the movie is great - not for one minute does one feel bored or restless. We have seen it 5 or 6 times and it retains its charm. Highly recommended for fans of the out of the ordinary, or British humour.

    Flora Poste is an aspiring novelist whose idea of writing seems to comprise of stealing bits from famous authors and scribbling them in her notebook,presumably trusting to her muse for inspiration in cobbling them together.Not unlike then Miss Stella Gibbons who borrows from sources as diverse as Austen and Lawrence to produce "Cold Comfort Farm".Her novel's saving grace is that it is clever (but not clever - clever)and very funny. Mis Poste is an orphan trying to exist on &pound;100 a year allowance whilst awaiting literary inspiration. She goes to live with relatives in rural Sussex,the Starkadders,who run the eponymous "Cold Comfort Farm". There is a Chaucerian vulgarity to their personal habits and jovial disregard of middle class morals which discomfits Miss Poste and she decides to lift them up a peg or two,to "help" them whether or not they want it - a bit like "Amelie",in fact. Every literary clich&eacute; about rural England is cheerfully exploded,the lusty farmer's sons,the hell and brimstone preacher,the dark secret,Miss Gibbons mocks them all - but in a good - natured way. Mr J.Schlesinger,master of the British New Wave fifty years ago,manages the difficult task of making everything seem totally O.T.T.whilst maintaining a firm grasp. Miss K.Beckinsale is perfect as Miss Poste: a character never actually meant to be believable,merely lovable.Like a sophisticated Fairy Godmother. Mr Freddie Jones and Miss Eileen Atkins avoid Grand Guignol by a thoroughly enjoyable hairsbreadth. My late aunt had a copy of "Cold Comfort Farm" which was published whilst she was in her early twenties.She recommended it to me as a teenager but I decided it wasn't cool enough for a man who dug Gerry Mulligan and Shorty Rogers. Clearing out her house,I rescued just two of her books,one she had won as a school prize and "Cold Comfort Farm". I found it just as cool as Gerry and Shorty.I just wish she was still around so I could tell her.

    Let me preface my remarks by saying that I love Masterpiece Theatre and most British farces. Perhaps this particular effort was lacking in some cohesion that might have held my attention. Although the characters were certainly characters and the incongruities certainly incongruous, nothing about this movie satisfied my curiosity. The cast was terrific and their acting was quite good but the storyline seemed unhinged. If a lot of the book was omitted the movie didn't prompt me to even consider reading it. I was left with the uncomfortable feeling of having watched a bunch of oddities that somehow were never properly connected. And the denouement (a final part of a story or drama in which everything is made clear and no questions or surprises remain) was completely useless in that regard since it left me with more questions than I had before. What a disappointment this dog of a flick was.

    "Cold Comfort Farm" has to be one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The acting was dismal, the story line unengaging, the direction indifferent, and the all-too-frequent attempts at humor pathetically lacking in comedic chops. This so-called "star," Kate Beckinsale, could not act her way out of an amateur troupe, at least to judge from the shallow characterization here. Stephen Fry was bad, bad, bad, as was Joanna Lumley. Only Ivan Kaye as Reuben Starkadder deserves any kind of accolades. He was the solitary believable member of the wasted cast. I kept waiting for "Cold Comfort Farm" to get off the ground, but it just wallowed in its own mediocrity. Even the music was ill-conceived. At one point, a lengthy excerpt from Max Steiner's "Gone With the Wind" soundtrack came out of nowhere, an embarrassing anachronism worthy of another clunker from the past, Baz Luhrmann's horrid "Moulin Rouge!" Please don't invest your hard-earned money in this misguided project. You will regret it.

    Kate Bekinsale plays a chic young woman who inherits a pittance and, to save money and perhaps gather material for a novel, moves to remote Cold Comfort Farm. She gets more than she bargained for. First of all, the farm is really a farm, with cows, pigs, horses and barns. Second, it's a sprawling, dilapidated affair, which one character refers to as "the house of Usher." Third, the place is cluttered and filthy and no one cares. Fourth, the half dozen or so residents are just as filthy as the floor and seem to have been inbred for generations. Finally, they are apparently ruled by an old madwoman who sequesters herself in an upstairs room and mutters about having once seen something nasty in the woodshed. Now, these are all very queer characters and each in his own way is a fit case study of psychopathology. Perhaps the most interesting is the preacher, who carries on in the local church, the walls of which are spritzed with lurid graffiti, about how much hell hurts. Did you ever burn your finger? It hurt, didn't it. And what did you do about the burned finger? You put butter on it. Well, friends, THERE IS NO BUTTER IN HELL. Man, there is material enough for a dozen novels. There is a problem with a movie so filled with nuts though. It reminded me of a movie I'd worked in, "Crimes of the Heart," written by Beth Hemsley, about three quirky sisters, any one of whom would have provided a viable narrative. But "Crimes of the Heart," like "Cold Comfort Farm," really has nowhere to much go. In this movie, Kate Bekinsale -- a fantasy of pale and vulnerable beauty -- straightens everything out. People wind up married to those whom they should marry. A half-hour, off-screen chat brings the old crone to her senses and she takes off for Paris. The farm ends up in the hands of the most capable of its workers. Bekinsale literally sails off with the handsome young aviator. Afterwards I felt as if I'd visited a mother who trotted out a handful of lovely children, had them rattle off an idiosyncratic and brilliant version of the Trout Quintet, and then shuffled them outside to play. Gone in a twinkling. It's interesting without being particularly well constructed. Loved the characters, some of them anyway, and almost fell asleep waiting for the happy ending.

    It is the 1930s, and London gadabout Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) has just been orphaned. With no options or ambition (except to experience life and become a writer), she goes to live in the country with distant relatives. Upon arriving at the dilapidated farm, she finds its inhabitants are all gloomy, filthy, wretched oafs, so naturally she sets about improving their lives. This basic plot has been done before, most notably in "Amelie," but this BBC movie is terrible. There's no humor, the characters are all off-putting, and the changes Flora brings about - including turning a spaced-out na&iuml;f into a debutante, a deranged hermit into a fine lady, and a bumbling farm hand into a Hollywood star - are completely unbelievable. As Flora, Beckinsale is flat and tiresome and the relatives are reduced to English hillbillies. This is a tedious and unappealing movie.

    Oh how I loved this movie. It's movie heaven to me. It's funny, romantic, escapist, and has a happy ending. It left me feeling happy and energized. I just got the DVD and hadn't seen the movie before, and I was delighted. This is the sort of movie the Brits excel at: it's subtle, not violent, has superb performances, has a wry, intelligent script, the cinematography is visually beautiful shots of the British countryside, and the score is lovely and sets and matches the tone of the movie. It's low key and humanistic as opposed to Hollywood mainstream blockbusters with their explosive special effects. Farm doesn't have any special effects but is a delight because of the witty, intelligent script, superb acting, and visually gorgeous cinematography. I recommend turning the subtitles on if you're watching the DVD because the British accents and slang make it easy to miss words and lines without the subtitles.

    This is Kate Beckinsale back when she acted instead of did action movies for big bucks. Although I wish they hadn't left out some of the characters and changed some things around from the original book, this movie kept the whacky spirit of Stella Gibbon's novel. For instance, in the novel there were a host of other Starkadders being mistreated by Aunt Ada Doom who Flora helps, Rinnit marries the author Mr. Mybug (Myerburg!) played by Stephen Frye, not Ruben, and the farm isn't actually in bad shape. Ruben has been cooking the books he shows to Aunt Ada so that he can use the money to improve the farm. I have only been able to get my hands on one of the two sequel novels that Stella Gibbons wrote about these same characters, Conference at Cold Comfort Farm and it is not quite as good. But you do get to find out what happened to some of the characters after WWII. Someday I hope to get a copy of Christmas at cold comfort farm to read. Whacky good fun and I like the message that people should follow their own dream (even nutjob religious maniac Cousin Amos, brilliantly played by Sir Ian McKellan) rather than be a slave to a tyrant. It is unrealistic that Aunt Ada can be redeemed so easily but I like the way she was played, as having an epiphany when the American film Czar Mr. Neck asks her if the nasty thing in the woodshed saw her. Excellent movie all around.

    It's a real pity; it's a hilarious book, the cast is excellent, the sets are terrific, and yet, the film just misses the mark. It was as if none of the screen writers understood the book's humor, really, and there were only a few things about the film that I did enjoy: (1) Mrs. Smiling and the way the film showed how she keeps her collection; (2) Seth and Reuben looked like brothers; (3) I adore Sir Ian in anything he does, and he did a lovely job on Amos, different from Alistair Sim, but just as delightful. I think what was really needed for this film to work was a better screenplay based on the book. I honestly don't think that this movie captured the fun of the book in the way that the earlier BBC version did. I actually found it a bit tedious, rather than fun, and they left out some of the best lines, really, for no good reason. I found that it got rather boring toward the end, and didn't really manage to give a sense of Flora Poste's STRUGGLE to change Cold Comfort Farm--it all changed too easily, and so one didn't really have the nice tension "will she succeed?"--she wins over everybody far too easily, and I think a good deal of the story is probably incomprehensible without knowing the book first. So--my verdict is: find that wonderful old BBC version with Alistair Sim and Rosalie Crutchley and Faye Compton--and treat yourself to the book, which is the sort you pull out again to enjoy afresh, years later, and catch this one if it comes on TV, but don't go out of your way for it.

Whacky good fun and I like the message that people should follow their own dream (even nutjob religious maniac Cousin Amos, brilliantly played by Sir Ian McKellan) rather than be a slave to a tyrant. It is unrealistic that Aunt Ada can be redeemed so easily but I like the way she was played, as having an epiphany when the American film Czar Mr. Neck asks her if the nasty thing in the woodshed saw her. Excellent movie all around.

    It's a real pity; it's a hilarious book, the cast is excellent, the sets are terrific, and yet, the film just misses the mark. It was as if none of the screen writers understood the book's humor, really, and there were only a few things about the film that I did enjoy: (1) Mrs. Smiling and the way the film showed how she keeps her collection; (2) Seth and Reuben looked like brothers; (3) I adore Sir Ian in anything he does, and he did a lovely job on Amos, different from Alistair Sim, but just as delightful. I think what was really needed for this film to work was a better screenplay based on the book. I honestly don't think that this movie captured the fun of the book in the way that the earlier BBC version did. I actually found it a bit tedious, rather than fun, and they left out some of the best lines, really, for no good reason. I found that it got rather boring toward the end, and didn't really manage to give a sense of Flora Poste's STRUGGLE to change Cold Comfort Farm--it all changed too easily, and so one didn't really have the nice tension "will she succeed?"--she wins over everybody far too easily, and I think a good deal of the story is probably incomprehensible without knowing the book first. So--my verdict is: find that wonderful old BBC version with Alistair Sim and Rosalie Crutchley and Faye Compton--and treat yourself to the book, which is the sort you pull out again to enjoy afresh, years later, and catch this one if it comes on TV, but don't go out of your way for it.

    A young woman in 1930s England tries to mooch off her relatives as she gathers material for her future career as a writer. This is meant to be a spoof of the novels of such writers as Dickens and Austen. It is described as a comedy, and the way the actors deliver their lines certainly suggests that the dialog is dripping with wit. The only problem is that there is nary a single chuckle to be had from the humorless script. With hardly a plot to hold one's interest, it soon turns into a dreary bore. It is based on a popular comic novel from the 1930s; hence the humor is either dated or the screenplay does not do justice to the novel. It's a shame because it has a good cast that seems to be really trying.

    Loved this movie. Loved the book and was totally impressed with how they adapted it, nothing was lost. The story is simple: Set in England, sometime around the 1930's - a young woman, Flora Post, is left with a very small annuity after her parents die. She needs to either find a suitable job, or find some suitable relative with whom to live. After she sends out enquiries to a number of relatives and receives responses, she decides to go to her country cousins, the Starkadders. Flora has no qualms about setting off on this adventure, but her cousins have NO idea of what they have let themselves in for. We join her on her adventures and are completely sucked into the story and the surroundings. Nothing defies her, nothing worries her, she sails through the lives and routines, gloom and joy of her cousins and their associates with the greatest of ease and comfort. Flora loves to organize things, and she relentlessly creates order from chaos at Starkadder Farm, in a charming way. There is so much to love about the story itself which is lightheartedly and gently making fund of a certain time in British history. The acting is amazing, the casting is incredible. The pacing of the movie is great - not for one minute does one feel bored or restless. We have seen it 5 or 6 times and it retains its charm. Highly recommended for fans of the out of the ordinary, or British humour.

    Flora Poste is an aspiring novelist whose idea of writing seems to comprise of stealing bits from famous authors and scribbling them in her notebook,presumably trusting to her muse for inspiration in cobbling them together.Not unlike then Miss Stella Gibbons who borrows from sources as diverse as Austen and Lawrence to produce "Cold Comfort Farm".Her novel's saving grace is that it is clever (but not clever - clever)and very funny. Mis Poste is an orphan trying to exist on &pound;100 a year allowance whilst awaiting literary inspiration. She goes to live with relatives in rural Sussex,the Starkadders,who run the eponymous "Cold Comfort Farm". There is a Chaucerian vulgarity to their personal habits and jovial disregard of middle class morals which discomfits Miss Poste and she decides to lift them up a peg or two,to "help" them whether or not they want it - a bit like "Amelie",in fact. Every literary clich&eacute; about rural England is cheerfully exploded,the lusty farmer's sons,the hell and brimstone preacher,the dark secret,Miss Gibbons mocks them all - but in a good - natured way. Mr J.Schlesinger,master of the British New Wave fifty years ago,manages the difficult task of making everything seem totally O.T.T.whilst maintaining a firm grasp. Miss K.Beckinsale is perfect as Miss Poste: a character never actually meant to be believable,merely lovable.Like a sophisticated Fairy Godmother. Mr Freddie Jones and Miss Eileen Atkins avoid Grand Guignol by a thoroughly enjoyable hairsbreadth. My late aunt had a copy of "Cold Comfort Farm" which was published whilst she was in her early twenties.She recommended it to me as a teenager but I decided it wasn't cool enough for a man who dug Gerry Mulligan and Shorty Rogers. Clearing out her house,I rescued just two of her books,one she had won as a school prize and "Cold Comfort Farm". I found it just as cool as Gerry and Shorty.I just wish she was still around so I could tell her.

    Let me preface my remarks by saying that I love Masterpiece Theatre and most British farces. Perhaps this particular effort was lacking in some cohesion that might have held my attention. Although the characters were certainly characters and the incongruities certainly incongruous, nothing about this movie satisfied my curiosity. The cast was terrific and their acting was quite good but the storyline seemed unhinged. If a lot of the book was omitted the movie didn't prompt me to even consider reading it. I was left with the uncomfortable feeling of having watched a bunch of oddities that somehow were never properly connected. And the denouement (a final part of a story or drama in which everything is made clear and no questions or surprises remain) was completely useless in that regard since it left me with more questions than I had before. What a disappointment this dog of a flick was.

    "Cold Comfort Farm" has to be one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The acting was dismal, the story line unengaging, the direction indifferent, and the all-too-frequent attempts at humor pathetically lacking in comedic chops. This so-called "star," Kate Beckinsale, could not act her way out of an amateur troupe, at least to judge from the shallow characterization here. Stephen Fry was bad, bad, bad, as was Joanna Lumley. Only Ivan Kaye as Reuben Starkadder deserves any kind of accolades. He was the solitary believable member of the wasted cast. I kept waiting for "Cold Comfort Farm" to get off the ground, but it just wallowed in its own mediocrity. Even the music was ill-conceived. At one point, a lengthy excerpt from Max Steiner's "Gone With the Wind" soundtrack came out of nowhere, an embarrassing anachronism worthy of another clunker from the past, Baz Luhrmann's horrid "Moulin Rouge!" Please don't invest your hard-earned money in this misguided project. You will regret it.

    Kate Bekinsale plays a chic young woman who inherits a pittance and, to save money and perhaps gather material for a novel, moves to remote Cold Comfort Farm. She gets more than she bargained for. First of all, the farm is really a farm, with cows, pigs, horses and barns. Second, it's a sprawling, dilapidated affair, which one character refers to as "the house of Usher." Third, the place is cluttered and filthy and no one cares. Fourth, the half dozen or so residents are just as filthy as the floor and seem to have been inbred for generations. Finally, they are apparently ruled by an old madwoman who sequesters herself in an upstairs room and mutters about having once seen something nasty in the woodshed. Now, these are all very queer characters and each in his own way is a fit case study of psychopathology. Perhaps the most interesting is the preacher, who carries on in the local church, the walls of which are spritzed with lurid graffiti, about how much hell hurts. Did you ever burn your finger? It hurt, didn't it. And what did you do about the burned finger? You put butter on it. Well, friends, THERE IS NO BUTTER IN HELL. Man, there is material enough for a dozen novels. There is a problem with a movie so filled with nuts though. It reminded me of a movie I'd worked in, "Crimes of the Heart," written by Beth Hemsley, about three quirky sisters, any one of whom would have provided a viable narrative. But "Crimes of the Heart," like "Cold Comfort Farm," really has nowhere to much go. In this movie, Kate Bekinsale -- a fantasy of pale and vulnerable beauty -- straightens everything out. People wind up married to those whom they should marry. A half-hour, off-screen chat brings the old crone to her senses and she takes off for Paris. The farm ends up in the hands of the most capable of its workers. Bekinsale literally sails off with the handsome young aviator. Afterwards I felt as if I'd visited a mother who trotted out a handful of lovely children, had them rattle off an idiosyncratic and brilliant version of the Trout Quintet, and then shuffled them outside to play. Gone in a twinkling. It's interesting without being particularly well constructed. Loved the characters, some of them anyway, and almost fell asleep waiting for the happy ending.

    It is the 1930s, and London gadabout Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) has just been orphaned. With no options or ambition (except to experience life and become a writer), she goes to live in the country with distant relatives. Upon arriving at the dilapidated farm, she finds its inhabitants are all gloomy, filthy, wretched oafs, so naturally she sets about improving their lives. This basic plot has been done before, most notably in "Amelie," but this BBC movie is terrible. There's no humor, the characters are all off-putting, and the changes Flora brings about - including turning a spaced-out na&iuml;f into a debutante, a deranged hermit into a fine lady, and a bumbling farm hand into a Hollywood star - are completely unbelievable. As Flora, Beckinsale is flat and tiresome and the relatives are reduced to English hillbillies. This is a tedious and unappealing movie.

    Oh how I loved this movie. It's movie heaven to me. It's funny, romantic, escapist, and has a happy ending. It left me feeling happy and energized. I just got the DVD and hadn't seen the movie before, and I was delighted. This is the sort of movie the Brits excel at: it's subtle, not violent, has superb performances, has a wry, intelligent script, the cinematography is visually beautiful shots of the British countryside, and the score is lovely and sets and matches the tone of the movie. It's low key and humanistic as opposed to Hollywood mainstream blockbusters with their explosive special effects. Farm doesn't have any special effects but is a delight because of the witty, intelligent script, superb acting, and visually gorgeous cinematography. I recommend turning the subtitles on if you're watching the DVD because the British accents and slang make it easy to miss words and lines without the subtitles.

    This is Kate Beckinsale back when she acted instead of did action movies for big bucks. Although I wish they hadn't left out some of the characters and changed some things around from the original book, this movie kept the whacky spirit of Stella Gibbon's novel. For instance, in the novel there were a host of other Starkadders being mistreated by Aunt Ada Doom who Flora helps, Rinnit marries the author Mr. Mybug (Myerburg!) played by Stephen Frye, not Ruben, and the farm isn't actually in bad shape. Ruben has been cooking the books he shows to Aunt Ada so that he can use the money to improve the farm. I have only been able to get my hands on one of the two sequel novels that Stella Gibbons wrote about these same characters, Conference at Cold Comfort Farm and it is not quite as good. But you do get to find out what happened to some of the characters after WWII. Someday I hope to get a copy of Christmas at cold comfort farm to read. Whacky good fun and I like the message that people should follow their own dream (even nutjob religious maniac Cousin Amos, brilliantly played by Sir Ian McKellan) rather than be a slave to a tyrant.

Ruben has been cooking the books he shows to Aunt Ada so that he can use the money to improve the farm. I have only been able to get my hands on one of the two sequel novels that Stella Gibbons wrote about these same characters, Conference at Cold Comfort Farm and it is not quite as good. But you do get to find out what happened to some of the characters after WWII. Someday I hope to get a copy of Christmas at cold comfort farm to read. Whacky good fun and I like the message that people should follow their own dream (even nutjob religious maniac Cousin Amos, brilliantly played by Sir Ian McKellan) rather than be a slave to a tyrant. It is unrealistic that Aunt Ada can be redeemed so easily but I like the way she was played, as having an epiphany when the American film Czar Mr. Neck asks her if the nasty thing in the woodshed saw her. Excellent movie all around.

    It's a real pity; it's a hilarious book, the cast is excellent, the sets are terrific, and yet, the film just misses the mark. It was as if none of the screen writers understood the book's humor, really, and there were only a few things about the film that I did enjoy: (1) Mrs. Smiling and the way the film showed how she keeps her collection; (2) Seth and Reuben looked like brothers; (3) I adore Sir Ian in anything he does, and he did a lovely job on Amos, different from Alistair Sim, but just as delightful. I think what was really needed for this film to work was a better screenplay based on the book. I honestly don't think that this movie captured the fun of the book in the way that the earlier BBC version did. I actually found it a bit tedious, rather than fun, and they left out some of the best lines, really, for no good reason. I found that it got rather boring toward the end, and didn't really manage to give a sense of Flora Poste's STRUGGLE to change Cold Comfort Farm--it all changed too easily, and so one didn't really have the nice tension "will she succeed?"--she wins over everybody far too easily, and I think a good deal of the story is probably incomprehensible without knowing the book first. So--my verdict is: find that wonderful old BBC version with Alistair Sim and Rosalie Crutchley and Faye Compton--and treat yourself to the book, which is the sort you pull out again to enjoy afresh, years later, and catch this one if it comes on TV, but don't go out of your way for it.

    A young woman in 1930s England tries to mooch off her relatives as she gathers material for her future career as a writer. This is meant to be a spoof of the novels of such writers as Dickens and Austen. It is described as a comedy, and the way the actors deliver their lines certainly suggests that the dialog is dripping with wit. The only problem is that there is nary a single chuckle to be had from the humorless script. With hardly a plot to hold one's interest, it soon turns into a dreary bore. It is based on a popular comic novel from the 1930s; hence the humor is either dated or the screenplay does not do justice to the novel. It's a shame because it has a good cast that seems to be really trying.

    Loved this movie. Loved the book and was totally impressed with how they adapted it, nothing was lost. The story is simple: Set in England, sometime around the 1930's - a young woman, Flora Post, is left with a very small annuity after her parents die. She needs to either find a suitable job, or find some suitable relative with whom to live. After she sends out enquiries to a number of relatives and receives responses, she decides to go to her country cousins, the Starkadders. Flora has no qualms about setting off on this adventure, but her cousins have NO idea of what they have let themselves in for. We join her on her adventures and are completely sucked into the story and the surroundings. Nothing defies her, nothing worries her, she sails through the lives and routines, gloom and joy of her cousins and their associates with the greatest of ease and comfort. Flora loves to organize things, and she relentlessly creates order from chaos at Starkadder Farm, in a charming way. There is so much to love about the story itself which is lightheartedly and gently making fund of a certain time in British history. The acting is amazing, the casting is incredible. The pacing of the movie is great - not for one minute does one feel bored or restless. We have seen it 5 or 6 times and it retains its charm. Highly recommended for fans of the out of the ordinary, or British humour.

    Flora Poste is an aspiring novelist whose idea of writing seems to comprise of stealing bits from famous authors and scribbling them in her notebook,presumably trusting to her muse for inspiration in cobbling them together.Not unlike then Miss Stella Gibbons who borrows from sources as diverse as Austen and Lawrence to produce "Cold Comfort Farm".Her novel's saving grace is that it is clever (but not clever - clever)and very funny. Mis Poste is an orphan trying to exist on &pound;100 a year allowance whilst awaiting literary inspiration. She goes to live with relatives in rural Sussex,the Starkadders,who run the eponymous "Cold Comfort Farm". There is a Chaucerian vulgarity to their personal habits and jovial disregard of middle class morals which discomfits Miss Poste and she decides to lift them up a peg or two,to "help" them whether or not they want it - a bit like "Amelie",in fact. Every literary clich&eacute; about rural England is cheerfully exploded,the lusty farmer's sons,the hell and brimstone preacher,the dark secret,Miss Gibbons mocks them all - but in a good - natured way. Mr J.Schlesinger,master of the British New Wave fifty years ago,manages the difficult task of making everything seem totally O.T.T.whilst maintaining a firm grasp. Miss K.Beckinsale is perfect as Miss Poste: a character never actually meant to be believable,merely lovable.Like a sophisticated Fairy Godmother. Mr Freddie Jones and Miss Eileen Atkins avoid Grand Guignol by a thoroughly enjoyable hairsbreadth. My late aunt had a copy of "Cold Comfort Farm" which was published whilst she was in her early twenties.She recommended it to me as a teenager but I decided it wasn't cool enough for a man who dug Gerry Mulligan and Shorty Rogers. Clearing out her house,I rescued just two of her books,one she had won as a school prize and "Cold Comfort Farm". I found it just as cool as Gerry and Shorty.I just wish she was still around so I could tell her.

    Let me preface my remarks by saying that I love Masterpiece Theatre and most British farces. Perhaps this particular effort was lacking in some cohesion that might have held my attention. Although the characters were certainly characters and the incongruities certainly incongruous, nothing about this movie satisfied my curiosity. The cast was terrific and their acting was quite good but the storyline seemed unhinged. If a lot of the book was omitted the movie didn't prompt me to even consider reading it. I was left with the uncomfortable feeling of having watched a bunch of oddities that somehow were never properly connected. And the denouement (a final part of a story or drama in which everything is made clear and no questions or surprises remain) was completely useless in that regard since it left me with more questions than I had before. What a disappointment this dog of a flick was.

    "Cold Comfort Farm" has to be one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The acting was dismal, the story line unengaging, the direction indifferent, and the all-too-frequent attempts at humor pathetically lacking in comedic chops. This so-called "star," Kate Beckinsale, could not act her way out of an amateur troupe, at least to judge from the shallow characterization here. Stephen Fry was bad, bad, bad, as was Joanna Lumley. Only Ivan Kaye as Reuben Starkadder deserves any kind of accolades. He was the solitary believable member of the wasted cast. I kept waiting for "Cold Comfort Farm" to get off the ground, but it just wallowed in its own mediocrity. Even the music was ill-conceived. At one point, a lengthy excerpt from Max Steiner's "Gone With the Wind" soundtrack came out of nowhere, an embarrassing anachronism worthy of another clunker from the past, Baz Luhrmann's horrid "Moulin Rouge!" Please don't invest your hard-earned money in this misguided project. You will regret it.

    Kate Bekinsale plays a chic young woman who inherits a pittance and, to save money and perhaps gather material for a novel, moves to remote Cold Comfort Farm. She gets more than she bargained for. First of all, the farm is really a farm, with cows, pigs, horses and barns. Second, it's a sprawling, dilapidated affair, which one character refers to as "the house of Usher." Third, the place is cluttered and filthy and no one cares. Fourth, the half dozen or so residents are just as filthy as the floor and seem to have been inbred for generations. Finally, they are apparently ruled by an old madwoman who sequesters herself in an upstairs room and mutters about having once seen something nasty in the woodshed. Now, these are all very queer characters and each in his own way is a fit case study of psychopathology. Perhaps the most interesting is the preacher, who carries on in the local church, the walls of which are spritzed with lurid graffiti, about how much hell hurts. Did you ever burn your finger? It hurt, didn't it. And what did you do about the burned finger? You put butter on it. Well, friends, THERE IS NO BUTTER IN HELL. Man, there is material enough for a dozen novels. There is a problem with a movie so filled with nuts though. It reminded me of a movie I'd worked in, "Crimes of the Heart," written by Beth Hemsley, about three quirky sisters, any one of whom would have provided a viable narrative. But "Crimes of the Heart," like "Cold Comfort Farm," really has nowhere to much go. In this movie, Kate Bekinsale -- a fantasy of pale and vulnerable beauty -- straightens everything out. People wind up married to those whom they should marry. A half-hour, off-screen chat brings the old crone to her senses and she takes off for Paris. The farm ends up in the hands of the most capable of its workers. Bekinsale literally sails off with the handsome young aviator. Afterwards I felt as if I'd visited a mother who trotted out a handful of lovely children, had them rattle off an idiosyncratic and brilliant version of the Trout Quintet, and then shuffled them outside to play. Gone in a twinkling. It's interesting without being particularly well constructed. Loved the characters, some of them anyway, and almost fell asleep waiting for the happy ending.

    It is the 1930s, and London gadabout Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) has just been orphaned. With no options or ambition (except to experience life and become a writer), she goes to live in the country with distant relatives. Upon arriving at the dilapidated farm, she finds its inhabitants are all gloomy, filthy, wretched oafs, so naturally she sets about improving their lives. This basic plot has been done before, most notably in "Amelie," but this BBC movie is terrible. There's no humor, the characters are all off-putting, and the changes Flora brings about - including turning a spaced-out na&iuml;f into a debutante, a deranged hermit into a fine lady, and a bumbling farm hand into a Hollywood star - are completely unbelievable. As Flora, Beckinsale is flat and tiresome and the relatives are reduced to English hillbillies. This is a tedious and unappealing movie.

    Oh how I loved this movie. It's movie heaven to me. It's funny, romantic, escapist, and has a happy ending. It left me feeling happy and energized. I just got the DVD and hadn't seen the movie before, and I was delighted. This is the sort of movie the Brits excel at: it's subtle, not violent, has superb performances, has a wry, intelligent script, the cinematography is visually beautiful shots of the British countryside, and the score is lovely and sets and matches the tone of the movie. It's low key and humanistic as opposed to Hollywood mainstream blockbusters with their explosive special effects. Farm doesn't have any special effects but is a delight because of the witty, intelligent script, superb acting, and visually gorgeous cinematography. I recommend turning the subtitles on if you're watching the DVD because the British accents and slang make it easy to miss words and lines without the subtitles.

    This is Kate Beckinsale back when she acted instead of did action movies for big bucks. Although I wish they hadn't left out some of the characters and changed some things around from the original book, this movie kept the whacky spirit of Stella Gibbon's novel. For instance, in the novel there were a host of other Starkadders being mistreated by Aunt Ada Doom who Flora helps, Rinnit marries the author Mr. Mybug (Myerburg!) played by Stephen Frye, not Ruben, and the farm isn't actually in bad shape. Ruben has been cooking the books he shows to Aunt Ada so that he can use the money to improve the farm.

    This is Kate Beckinsale back when she acted instead of did action movies for big bucks. Although I wish they hadn't left out some of the characters and changed some things around from the original book, this movie kept the whacky spirit of Stella Gibbon's novel. For instance, in the novel there were a host of other Starkadders being mistreated by Aunt Ada Doom who Flora helps, Rinnit marries the author Mr. Mybug (Myerburg!) played by Stephen Frye, not Ruben, and the farm isn't actually in bad shape. Ruben has been cooking the books he shows to Aunt Ada so that he can use the money to improve the farm. I have only been able to get my hands on one of the two sequel novels that Stella Gibbons wrote about these same characters, Conference at Cold Comfort Farm and it is not quite as good. But you do get to find out what happened to some of the characters after WWII. Someday I hope to get a copy of Christmas at cold comfort farm to read. Whacky good fun and I like the message that people should follow their own dream (even nutjob religious maniac Cousin Amos, brilliantly played by Sir Ian McKellan) rather than be a slave to a tyrant. It is unrealistic that Aunt Ada can be redeemed so easily but I like the way she was played, as having an epiphany when the American film Czar Mr. Neck asks her if the nasty thing in the woodshed saw her. Excellent movie all around.

    It's a real pity; it's a hilarious book, the cast is excellent, the sets are terrific, and yet, the film just misses the mark. It was as if none of the screen writers understood the book's humor, really, and there were only a few things about the film that I did enjoy: (1) Mrs. Smiling and the way the film showed how she keeps her collection; (2) Seth and Reuben looked like brothers; (3) I adore Sir Ian in anything he does, and he did a lovely job on Amos, different from Alistair Sim, but just as delightful. I think what was really needed for this film to work was a better screenplay based on the book. I honestly don't think that this movie captured the fun of the book in the way that the earlier BBC version did. I actually found it a bit tedious, rather than fun, and they left out some of the best lines, really, for no good reason. I found that it got rather boring toward the end, and didn't really manage to give a sense of Flora Poste's STRUGGLE to change Cold Comfort Farm--it all changed too easily, and so one didn't really have the nice tension "will she succeed?"--she wins over everybody far too easily, and I think a good deal of the story is probably incomprehensible without knowing the book first. So--my verdict is: find that wonderful old BBC version with Alistair Sim and Rosalie Crutchley and Faye Compton--and treat yourself to the book, which is the sort you pull out again to enjoy afresh, years later, and catch this one if it comes on TV, but don't go out of your way for it.

    A young woman in 1930s England tries to mooch off her relatives as she gathers material for her future career as a writer. This is meant to be a spoof of the novels of such writers as Dickens and Austen. It is described as a comedy, and the way the actors deliver their lines certainly suggests that the dialog is dripping with wit. The only problem is that there is nary a single chuckle to be had from the humorless script. With hardly a plot to hold one's interest, it soon turns into a dreary bore. It is based on a popular comic novel from the 1930s; hence the humor is either dated or the screenplay does not do justice to the novel. It's a shame because it has a good cast that seems to be really trying.

    Loved this movie. Loved the book and was totally impressed with how they adapted it, nothing was lost. The story is simple: Set in England, sometime around the 1930's - a young woman, Flora Post, is left with a very small annuity after her parents die. She needs to either find a suitable job, or find some suitable relative with whom to live. After she sends out enquiries to a number of relatives and receives responses, she decides to go to her country cousins, the Starkadders. Flora has no qualms about setting off on this adventure, but her cousins have NO idea of what they have let themselves in for. We join her on her adventures and are completely sucked into the story and the surroundings. Nothing defies her, nothing worries her, she sails through the lives and routines, gloom and joy of her cousins and their associates with the greatest of ease and comfort. Flora loves to organize things, and she relentlessly creates order from chaos at Starkadder Farm, in a charming way. There is so much to love about the story itself which is lightheartedly and gently making fund of a certain time in British history. The acting is amazing, the casting is incredible. The pacing of the movie is great - not for one minute does one feel bored or restless. We have seen it 5 or 6 times and it retains its charm. Highly recommended for fans of the out of the ordinary, or British humour.

    Flora Poste is an aspiring novelist whose idea of writing seems to comprise of stealing bits from famous authors and scribbling them in her notebook,presumably trusting to her muse for inspiration in cobbling them together.Not unlike then Miss Stella Gibbons who borrows from sources as diverse as Austen and Lawrence to produce "Cold Comfort Farm".Her novel's saving grace is that it is clever (but not clever - clever)and very funny. Mis Poste is an orphan trying to exist on &pound;100 a year allowance whilst awaiting literary inspiration. She goes to live with relatives in rural Sussex,the Starkadders,who run the eponymous "Cold Comfort Farm". There is a Chaucerian vulgarity to their personal habits and jovial disregard of middle class morals which discomfits Miss Poste and she decides to lift them up a peg or two,to "help" them whether or not they want it - a bit like "Amelie",in fact. Every literary clich&eacute; about rural England is cheerfully exploded,the lusty farmer's sons,the hell and brimstone preacher,the dark secret,Miss Gibbons mocks them all - but in a good - natured way. Mr J.Schlesinger,master of the British New Wave fifty years ago,manages the difficult task of making everything seem totally O.T.T.whilst maintaining a firm grasp. Miss K.Beckinsale is perfect as Miss Poste: a character never actually meant to be believable,merely lovable.Like a sophisticated Fairy Godmother. Mr Freddie Jones and Miss Eileen Atkins avoid Grand Guignol by a thoroughly enjoyable hairsbreadth. My late aunt had a copy of "Cold Comfort Farm" which was published whilst she was in her early twenties.She recommended it to me as a teenager but I decided it wasn't cool enough for a man who dug Gerry Mulligan and Shorty Rogers. Clearing out her house,I rescued just two of her books,one she had won as a school prize and "Cold Comfort Farm". I found it just as cool as Gerry and Shorty.I just wish she was still around so I could tell her.

    Let me preface my remarks by saying that I love Masterpiece Theatre and most British farces. Perhaps this particular effort was lacking in some cohesion that might have held my attention. Although the characters were certainly characters and the incongruities certainly incongruous, nothing about this movie satisfied my curiosity. The cast was terrific and their acting was quite good but the storyline seemed unhinged. If a lot of the book was omitted the movie didn't prompt me to even consider reading it. I was left with the uncomfortable feeling of having watched a bunch of oddities that somehow were never properly connected. And the denouement (a final part of a story or drama in which everything is made clear and no questions or surprises remain) was completely useless in that regard since it left me with more questions than I had before. What a disappointment this dog of a flick was.

    "Cold Comfort Farm" has to be one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The acting was dismal, the story line unengaging, the direction indifferent, and the all-too-frequent attempts at humor pathetically lacking in comedic chops. This so-called "star," Kate Beckinsale, could not act her way out of an amateur troupe, at least to judge from the shallow characterization here. Stephen Fry was bad, bad, bad, as was Joanna Lumley. Only Ivan Kaye as Reuben Starkadder deserves any kind of accolades. He was the solitary believable member of the wasted cast. I kept waiting for "Cold Comfort Farm" to get off the ground, but it just wallowed in its own mediocrity. Even the music was ill-conceived. At one point, a lengthy excerpt from Max Steiner's "Gone With the Wind" soundtrack came out of nowhere, an embarrassing anachronism worthy of another clunker from the past, Baz Luhrmann's horrid "Moulin Rouge!" Please don't invest your hard-earned money in this misguided project. You will regret it.

    Kate Bekinsale plays a chic young woman who inherits a pittance and, to save money and perhaps gather material for a novel, moves to remote Cold Comfort Farm. She gets more than she bargained for. First of all, the farm is really a farm, with cows, pigs, horses and barns. Second, it's a sprawling, dilapidated affair, which one character refers to as "the house of Usher." Third, the place is cluttered and filthy and no one cares. Fourth, the half dozen or so residents are just as filthy as the floor and seem to have been inbred for generations. Finally, they are apparently ruled by an old madwoman who sequesters herself in an upstairs room and mutters about having once seen something nasty in the woodshed. Now, these are all very queer characters and each in his own way is a fit case study of psychopathology. Perhaps the most interesting is the preacher, who carries on in the local church, the walls of which are spritzed with lurid graffiti, about how much hell hurts. Did you ever burn your finger? It hurt, didn't it. And what did you do about the burned finger? You put butter on it. Well, friends, THERE IS NO BUTTER IN HELL. Man, there is material enough for a dozen novels. There is a problem with a movie so filled with nuts though. It reminded me of a movie I'd worked in, "Crimes of the Heart," written by Beth Hemsley, about three quirky sisters, any one of whom would have provided a viable narrative. But "Crimes of the Heart," like "Cold Comfort Farm," really has nowhere to much go. In this movie, Kate Bekinsale -- a fantasy of pale and vulnerable beauty -- straightens everything out. People wind up married to those whom they should marry. A half-hour, off-screen chat brings the old crone to her senses and she takes off for Paris. The farm ends up in the hands of the most capable of its workers. Bekinsale literally sails off with the handsome young aviator. Afterwards I felt as if I'd visited a mother who trotted out a handful of lovely children, had them rattle off an idiosyncratic and brilliant version of the Trout Quintet, and then shuffled them outside to play. Gone in a twinkling. It's interesting without being particularly well constructed. Loved the characters, some of them anyway, and almost fell asleep waiting for the happy ending.

    It is the 1930s, and London gadabout Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) has just been orphaned. With no options or ambition (except to experience life and become a writer), she goes to live in the country with distant relatives. Upon arriving at the dilapidated farm, she finds its inhabitants are all gloomy, filthy, wretched oafs, so naturally she sets about improving their lives. This basic plot has been done before, most notably in "Amelie," but this BBC movie is terrible. There's no humor, the characters are all off-putting, and the changes Flora brings about - including turning a spaced-out na&iuml;f into a debutante, a deranged hermit into a fine lady, and a bumbling farm hand into a Hollywood star - are completely unbelievable. As Flora, Beckinsale is flat and tiresome and the relatives are reduced to English hillbillies. This is a tedious and unappealing movie.

    Oh how I loved this movie. It's movie heaven to me. It's funny, romantic, escapist, and has a happy ending. It left me feeling happy and energized. I just got the DVD and hadn't seen the movie before, and I was delighted. This is the sort of movie the Brits excel at: it's subtle, not violent, has superb performances, has a wry, intelligent script, the cinematography is visually beautiful shots of the British countryside, and the score is lovely and sets and matches the tone of the movie. It's low key and humanistic as opposed to Hollywood mainstream blockbusters with their explosive special effects. Farm doesn't have any special effects but is a delight because of the witty, intelligent script, superb acting, and visually gorgeous cinematography. I recommend turning the subtitles on if you're watching the DVD because the British accents and slang make it easy to miss words and lines without the subtitles.
