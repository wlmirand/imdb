    Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurrences was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him. Kate Winslet was astonishing as Rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldn't picture anyone else performing this character. Leonardo DiCaprio was also truly good as 'Jack'. He should have got the Oscar nomination for this character. Their connection appeared to contain all the features that every Hollywood romantic movie has. The two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other. They are both sufficient to surpass as teenagers. James Horner music was simply unforgettable and he forever lifts up the movie that he works on to his ultimate level. Desert leather offers all types of Hollywood style leather jackets. This movie has got to be one of the most magnificent movies of the 20th Century and one to remain unforgettable. It truly mentally hurts me when I don't see this movie in top 200 in IMDb's list. It upsets me when people say that they didn't like the movie. It might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success. Cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled. But it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting. This is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey. Many remarkable scenes of this movie settled on your brain. Not just the disaster or the romance scenes were memorable, but the immense gap showed between the rich and poor. I completely love this film and it gets from me a good 9/10.

    When I first watched Titanic, I was mesmerized. Everything about it enthralled me, and it became an instant favorite. Titanic has something for everybody- romance, drama, action, and adventure. For me, it was the unique mixture of it all that drew me to it. If you are hesitant to watch Titanic because it is a notoriously sad film, watch it anyway- you won't regret it. Although the ending is a tear-jerker, the final scene makes up for it. As a matter of fact, that final scene is my favorite- because the tears are happy tears, the perfect ending created by James Cameron, who has truly impacted cinema. I watched the special features and was beyond impressed with his genius.Not to mention the music, the costumes, and the special effects which are all huge factors in Titanic's monstrous success (11 Oscars!). Not a single person who views Titanic will ever forget it. I have personally watched it about 23 times, which sounds like a lot, but really isn't. By the time you have watched it as much as me, you will realize that while it has become a little too familiar- it is still one-of-a-kind. There is a reason Titanic is considered classic- it has become the basis for countless other films, defining a new generation of drama. If you have not watched Titanic yet, you are missing out. You have not experienced a truly amazing movie until you have cried and said to yourself "I will never let go!"

    Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond. The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.

    Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.

    What I cannot stand are the genre of people who not only cannot conjure a single logical reason for liking this film, but who cannot even write in proper English! Give me a BREAK! I, as a person who has been completely spellbound by the story of the (actual) Titanic for more than a decade, cannot understand why this film has become so popular and successful among audiences when it takes the real event that has become so famous and totally BUTCHERS it, before essentially using $200 million Scotch tape to put it back together in a way that can cater to James Cameron's need to create a soapy, poorly written romance. Seriously, people, if you want a GOOD historical romance, watch 'Gone With the Wind', or something else like that, but PLEASE, in the name of GOD, do something with your time that matters, like, you know, maybe actually learning the true story of the Titanic, a story more fascinating and ironic than anything even the greatest writers or movie makers could ever create. Another thing that irks me is the fact that people defend this film by speaking of the 'beauty' of it's story. Beauty, what beauty? Alright, here is what you people are trying to tell me: you think that a story about sin is 'beautiful.' Yes, that is what this movie is really about, SIN. It's about a 17 year old girl and boy having sex only two days after they've met, out of wedlock, and only after they've essentially done three things: He keeps her from killing herself, they dance in the Third Class General Room, he draws a sketch of her lying naked on a couch, and then they have sex. It's absolutely disgusting. And what's even more disgusting is the way they portray the social structure onboard the ship: First Class is supposed to be the symbol of greed and power, while Third Class is supposed to symbolize heroism and selflessness. So, in Cameron's words, the sacrifices made by Ida and Isador Strauss, who died together as husband and wife, don't mater, just like the death of almost the entire Allison family doesn't matter, just like First Class gentlemen giving up their lives so that others may be saved, doesn't matter. And what the HELL is with the way he portrays what happened in Third Class. He shows the crew forcibly keeping Third Class passengers from getting to the boat deck so that the First and Second classes can depart first, when, in reality, Third Class was simply neglected to death. It wasn't that they were prominently kept down, it's that they didn't know what to do in order to save themselves... There were vast language boundaries, and the White Star Line had very few translators. There were, in fact, gates dividing the different classes, but they were in place under the dictation of Immigration Laws, not because of outright discrimination. And why, when they show the Titanic leaving Southampton on April 10, do they show the weather as being sunny and clear, when, in reality (photographic evidence supports this), it was gray and overcast, but calm nonetheless. Didn't Cameron do any historical research whatsoever!? It's sad to see a man who seems to care enough about the ship to explore it with the depth that he did make such a poorly conceived piece of garbage and call it a film. Not only that, but movies like 'A Night to Remember' have already been made, so why not tell the story of the Lusitania disaster, or something else that actually NEEDS to be told on film? So, if you like ham-fisted love stories with stereotypical, depthless characters and an uninspired, mediocre screenplay, or if you are merely a sheep, then go ahead and watch it. I'll be on the dark side of the moon when you do.

    Starring Leonardo DiCaprio; Kate Winslet; Billy Zane & Kathy Bates So the question is -- is this the greatest movie of all time? Well, it's certainly the most successful. Maybe not the best movie of all time in my books, although I would have to say it comes pretty darn close. That's quite an admission coming from me, since I've never seen a love story that I didn't hate or fall asleep before the 1 hour mark. Titanic is just that a love story, even with the multimillion dollar sets and special effects, it is just a movie about the love two young passengers have for one another. I will have to admit, as love stories go, this was a very compelling one. Certainly, the best one I've ever seen. Although I still can't figure out what all the excitement is about regarding Leonardo DiCaprio. I guess I would have to be a teenage girl to figure out that one, but I digress. I went to see titanic not for the love story (I planned on tolerating it) but for the special effects. Believe it or not I actually found my cold-hearted self actually enjoying the romance between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While, as I've already said, I don't see what the fuss is over Leo, after seeing this film I couldn't imagine it being made with actors other than DiCaprio and Winslet in the lead roles. A fact that I think speaks volumes about their performances. There was truly no doubt, in my little mind at least, that by the end of the movie the characters of Jack and Rose were deeply in love. Heck, I actually even started to care about their romance. (I think I'm getting too soft.) Anyway, as they say, time flies when your having fun, and since I went to see the special effects, that is what I wanted to see. Now to get off topic for just a second, I was one of those who asked the burning questions before the movie came out. Who in their right mind spends 200 million dollars to make a film? Better yet on a film that everybody knows the ending to? If you are crazy enough to spend such huge amounts of cash, why wouldn't you cast some big name actors in the lead roles, so we the audience would have some reason to go? A whole lot of people asked those same questions. If they are anything like me, after seeing Titanic they had to ask themselves -- Why would I have ever asked such stupid questions? Why? Well, because critics are not filmmakers, and while we like to comment on films, and are relatively knowledgeable on the subject, for the most part we don't know as much as the people who make them. This is abundantly true with regard to Titanic's director James Cameron. The same man who many considered would be run out of Hollywood just a few short months before the film opened, is now being recognized as being among the greatest directors of all time. I really don't think that anyone can say enough about the job that this guy did. This brings me back around to the reason I went to see this film -- the special effects. The movie opens with breathtaking shots of the real Titanic on the bottom of the Atlantic, shot specifically for this film by director James Cameron. Although that almost pales by comparison to the special effects used during the last half of the movie as the ship is sinking. The 200 million dollar price tag is certainly evident on the screen. Both in the long shots where we get to see the great ship break up, and in the interior shots that were done in giant flooded tanks. If, like me, you go to Titanic for the special effects, I promise you will not be disappointed by anything that appears on the screen. A funny thing happened as I was watching the Titanic in its final minutes above the water. As much as I was in awe of the effects, and the complexity of the production, something else happened. An eerie feeling came over me. Unlike other disaster movies, this one really happened. All too often, when we think of the real Titanic sitting there on the bottom of the ocean, we forget something. Oh, we remember the tragedy of the situation and that hound reds of lives were lost, but most of us never stop to think what it must have like to be there on that ship as it was going down. James Cameron has captured those last moments, in a way that will make you think wonder why you never thought about it like that before. As spectacular as the special effects were, they could not overshadow a simple love story and the tragedy associated with one of the worst disasters of all time. A truly remarkable film, it is no wonder that so many people have gone back to this masterpiece several times.

    The following review was written by Francesca, an Italian student, as part of her English language studies: The Titanic is a moving film. The main characters are Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet),and they both very well in this film. Jack is a poor boy, but Rose is the daughter in a rich family. One day Jack wins some money and he goes on the Titantic. Rose is also on board the same ship. There they meet, and fall in love, but their circumstances mean they can't stay together. And then something terrible happens... The movie follows a great storyline and I think it is very beautiful.

    I am Dean Scheu. I am from the USA. I have watched Titanic nearly 7-8 times up to now because I like this movie very much. Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie. Thanks Dean Scheu

    Greetings from Lithuania. I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx "movies" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.

And why, when they show the Titanic leaving Southampton on April 10, do they show the weather as being sunny and clear, when, in reality (photographic evidence supports this), it was gray and overcast, but calm nonetheless. Didn't Cameron do any historical research whatsoever!? It's sad to see a man who seems to care enough about the ship to explore it with the depth that he did make such a poorly conceived piece of garbage and call it a film. Not only that, but movies like 'A Night to Remember' have already been made, so why not tell the story of the Lusitania disaster, or something else that actually NEEDS to be told on film? So, if you like ham-fisted love stories with stereotypical, depthless characters and an uninspired, mediocre screenplay, or if you are merely a sheep, then go ahead and watch it. I'll be on the dark side of the moon when you do.

    Starring Leonardo DiCaprio; Kate Winslet; Billy Zane & Kathy Bates So the question is -- is this the greatest movie of all time? Well, it's certainly the most successful. Maybe not the best movie of all time in my books, although I would have to say it comes pretty darn close. That's quite an admission coming from me, since I've never seen a love story that I didn't hate or fall asleep before the 1 hour mark. Titanic is just that a love story, even with the multimillion dollar sets and special effects, it is just a movie about the love two young passengers have for one another. I will have to admit, as love stories go, this was a very compelling one. Certainly, the best one I've ever seen. Although I still can't figure out what all the excitement is about regarding Leonardo DiCaprio. I guess I would have to be a teenage girl to figure out that one, but I digress. I went to see titanic not for the love story (I planned on tolerating it) but for the special effects. Believe it or not I actually found my cold-hearted self actually enjoying the romance between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While, as I've already said, I don't see what the fuss is over Leo, after seeing this film I couldn't imagine it being made with actors other than DiCaprio and Winslet in the lead roles. A fact that I think speaks volumes about their performances. There was truly no doubt, in my little mind at least, that by the end of the movie the characters of Jack and Rose were deeply in love. Heck, I actually even started to care about their romance. (I think I'm getting too soft.) Anyway, as they say, time flies when your having fun, and since I went to see the special effects, that is what I wanted to see. Now to get off topic for just a second, I was one of those who asked the burning questions before the movie came out. Who in their right mind spends 200 million dollars to make a film? Better yet on a film that everybody knows the ending to? If you are crazy enough to spend such huge amounts of cash, why wouldn't you cast some big name actors in the lead roles, so we the audience would have some reason to go? A whole lot of people asked those same questions. If they are anything like me, after seeing Titanic they had to ask themselves -- Why would I have ever asked such stupid questions? Why? Well, because critics are not filmmakers, and while we like to comment on films, and are relatively knowledgeable on the subject, for the most part we don't know as much as the people who make them. This is abundantly true with regard to Titanic's director James Cameron. The same man who many considered would be run out of Hollywood just a few short months before the film opened, is now being recognized as being among the greatest directors of all time. I really don't think that anyone can say enough about the job that this guy did. This brings me back around to the reason I went to see this film -- the special effects. The movie opens with breathtaking shots of the real Titanic on the bottom of the Atlantic, shot specifically for this film by director James Cameron. Although that almost pales by comparison to the special effects used during the last half of the movie as the ship is sinking. The 200 million dollar price tag is certainly evident on the screen. Both in the long shots where we get to see the great ship break up, and in the interior shots that were done in giant flooded tanks. If, like me, you go to Titanic for the special effects, I promise you will not be disappointed by anything that appears on the screen. A funny thing happened as I was watching the Titanic in its final minutes above the water. As much as I was in awe of the effects, and the complexity of the production, something else happened. An eerie feeling came over me. Unlike other disaster movies, this one really happened. All too often, when we think of the real Titanic sitting there on the bottom of the ocean, we forget something. Oh, we remember the tragedy of the situation and that hound reds of lives were lost, but most of us never stop to think what it must have like to be there on that ship as it was going down. James Cameron has captured those last moments, in a way that will make you think wonder why you never thought about it like that before. As spectacular as the special effects were, they could not overshadow a simple love story and the tragedy associated with one of the worst disasters of all time. A truly remarkable film, it is no wonder that so many people have gone back to this masterpiece several times.

    The following review was written by Francesca, an Italian student, as part of her English language studies: The Titanic is a moving film. The main characters are Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet),and they both very well in this film. Jack is a poor boy, but Rose is the daughter in a rich family. One day Jack wins some money and he goes on the Titantic. Rose is also on board the same ship. There they meet, and fall in love, but their circumstances mean they can't stay together. And then something terrible happens... The movie follows a great storyline and I think it is very beautiful.

    I am Dean Scheu. I am from the USA. I have watched Titanic nearly 7-8 times up to now because I like this movie very much. Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie. Thanks Dean Scheu

    Greetings from Lithuania. I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx "movies" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.

    Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurrences was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him. Kate Winslet was astonishing as Rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldn't picture anyone else performing this character. Leonardo DiCaprio was also truly good as 'Jack'. He should have got the Oscar nomination for this character. Their connection appeared to contain all the features that every Hollywood romantic movie has. The two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other. They are both sufficient to surpass as teenagers. James Horner music was simply unforgettable and he forever lifts up the movie that he works on to his ultimate level. Desert leather offers all types of Hollywood style leather jackets. This movie has got to be one of the most magnificent movies of the 20th Century and one to remain unforgettable. It truly mentally hurts me when I don't see this movie in top 200 in IMDb's list. It upsets me when people say that they didn't like the movie. It might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success. Cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled. But it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting. This is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey. Many remarkable scenes of this movie settled on your brain. Not just the disaster or the romance scenes were memorable, but the immense gap showed between the rich and poor. I completely love this film and it gets from me a good 9/10.

    When I first watched Titanic, I was mesmerized. Everything about it enthralled me, and it became an instant favorite. Titanic has something for everybody- romance, drama, action, and adventure. For me, it was the unique mixture of it all that drew me to it. If you are hesitant to watch Titanic because it is a notoriously sad film, watch it anyway- you won't regret it. Although the ending is a tear-jerker, the final scene makes up for it. As a matter of fact, that final scene is my favorite- because the tears are happy tears, the perfect ending created by James Cameron, who has truly impacted cinema. I watched the special features and was beyond impressed with his genius.Not to mention the music, the costumes, and the special effects which are all huge factors in Titanic's monstrous success (11 Oscars!). Not a single person who views Titanic will ever forget it. I have personally watched it about 23 times, which sounds like a lot, but really isn't. By the time you have watched it as much as me, you will realize that while it has become a little too familiar- it is still one-of-a-kind. There is a reason Titanic is considered classic- it has become the basis for countless other films, defining a new generation of drama. If you have not watched Titanic yet, you are missing out. You have not experienced a truly amazing movie until you have cried and said to yourself "I will never let go!"

    Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond. The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.

    Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.

    What I cannot stand are the genre of people who not only cannot conjure a single logical reason for liking this film, but who cannot even write in proper English! Give me a BREAK! I, as a person who has been completely spellbound by the story of the (actual) Titanic for more than a decade, cannot understand why this film has become so popular and successful among audiences when it takes the real event that has become so famous and totally BUTCHERS it, before essentially using $200 million Scotch tape to put it back together in a way that can cater to James Cameron's need to create a soapy, poorly written romance. Seriously, people, if you want a GOOD historical romance, watch 'Gone With the Wind', or something else like that, but PLEASE, in the name of GOD, do something with your time that matters, like, you know, maybe actually learning the true story of the Titanic, a story more fascinating and ironic than anything even the greatest writers or movie makers could ever create. Another thing that irks me is the fact that people defend this film by speaking of the 'beauty' of it's story. Beauty, what beauty? Alright, here is what you people are trying to tell me: you think that a story about sin is 'beautiful.' Yes, that is what this movie is really about, SIN. It's about a 17 year old girl and boy having sex only two days after they've met, out of wedlock, and only after they've essentially done three things: He keeps her from killing herself, they dance in the Third Class General Room, he draws a sketch of her lying naked on a couch, and then they have sex. It's absolutely disgusting. And what's even more disgusting is the way they portray the social structure onboard the ship: First Class is supposed to be the symbol of greed and power, while Third Class is supposed to symbolize heroism and selflessness. So, in Cameron's words, the sacrifices made by Ida and Isador Strauss, who died together as husband and wife, don't mater, just like the death of almost the entire Allison family doesn't matter, just like First Class gentlemen giving up their lives so that others may be saved, doesn't matter. And what the HELL is with the way he portrays what happened in Third Class. He shows the crew forcibly keeping Third Class passengers from getting to the boat deck so that the First and Second classes can depart first, when, in reality, Third Class was simply neglected to death. It wasn't that they were prominently kept down, it's that they didn't know what to do in order to save themselves... There were vast language boundaries, and the White Star Line had very few translators. There were, in fact, gates dividing the different classes, but they were in place under the dictation of Immigration Laws, not because of outright discrimination. And why, when they show the Titanic leaving Southampton on April 10, do they show the weather as being sunny and clear, when, in reality (photographic evidence supports this), it was gray and overcast, but calm nonetheless. Didn't Cameron do any historical research whatsoever!? It's sad to see a man who seems to care enough about the ship to explore it with the depth that he did make such a poorly conceived piece of garbage and call it a film. Not only that, but movies like 'A Night to Remember' have already been made, so why not tell the story of the Lusitania disaster, or something else that actually NEEDS to be told on film? So, if you like ham-fisted love stories with stereotypical, depthless characters and an uninspired, mediocre screenplay, or if you are merely a sheep, then go ahead and watch it. I'll be on the dark side of the moon when you do.

For me, it was the unique mixture of it all that drew me to it. If you are hesitant to watch Titanic because it is a notoriously sad film, watch it anyway- you won't regret it. Although the ending is a tear-jerker, the final scene makes up for it. As a matter of fact, that final scene is my favorite- because the tears are happy tears, the perfect ending created by James Cameron, who has truly impacted cinema. I watched the special features and was beyond impressed with his genius.Not to mention the music, the costumes, and the special effects which are all huge factors in Titanic's monstrous success (11 Oscars!). Not a single person who views Titanic will ever forget it. I have personally watched it about 23 times, which sounds like a lot, but really isn't. By the time you have watched it as much as me, you will realize that while it has become a little too familiar- it is still one-of-a-kind. There is a reason Titanic is considered classic- it has become the basis for countless other films, defining a new generation of drama. If you have not watched Titanic yet, you are missing out. You have not experienced a truly amazing movie until you have cried and said to yourself "I will never let go!"

    Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond. The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.

    Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.

    What I cannot stand are the genre of people who not only cannot conjure a single logical reason for liking this film, but who cannot even write in proper English! Give me a BREAK! I, as a person who has been completely spellbound by the story of the (actual) Titanic for more than a decade, cannot understand why this film has become so popular and successful among audiences when it takes the real event that has become so famous and totally BUTCHERS it, before essentially using $200 million Scotch tape to put it back together in a way that can cater to James Cameron's need to create a soapy, poorly written romance. Seriously, people, if you want a GOOD historical romance, watch 'Gone With the Wind', or something else like that, but PLEASE, in the name of GOD, do something with your time that matters, like, you know, maybe actually learning the true story of the Titanic, a story more fascinating and ironic than anything even the greatest writers or movie makers could ever create. Another thing that irks me is the fact that people defend this film by speaking of the 'beauty' of it's story. Beauty, what beauty? Alright, here is what you people are trying to tell me: you think that a story about sin is 'beautiful.' Yes, that is what this movie is really about, SIN. It's about a 17 year old girl and boy having sex only two days after they've met, out of wedlock, and only after they've essentially done three things: He keeps her from killing herself, they dance in the Third Class General Room, he draws a sketch of her lying naked on a couch, and then they have sex. It's absolutely disgusting. And what's even more disgusting is the way they portray the social structure onboard the ship: First Class is supposed to be the symbol of greed and power, while Third Class is supposed to symbolize heroism and selflessness. So, in Cameron's words, the sacrifices made by Ida and Isador Strauss, who died together as husband and wife, don't mater, just like the death of almost the entire Allison family doesn't matter, just like First Class gentlemen giving up their lives so that others may be saved, doesn't matter. And what the HELL is with the way he portrays what happened in Third Class. He shows the crew forcibly keeping Third Class passengers from getting to the boat deck so that the First and Second classes can depart first, when, in reality, Third Class was simply neglected to death. It wasn't that they were prominently kept down, it's that they didn't know what to do in order to save themselves... There were vast language boundaries, and the White Star Line had very few translators. There were, in fact, gates dividing the different classes, but they were in place under the dictation of Immigration Laws, not because of outright discrimination. And why, when they show the Titanic leaving Southampton on April 10, do they show the weather as being sunny and clear, when, in reality (photographic evidence supports this), it was gray and overcast, but calm nonetheless. Didn't Cameron do any historical research whatsoever!? It's sad to see a man who seems to care enough about the ship to explore it with the depth that he did make such a poorly conceived piece of garbage and call it a film. Not only that, but movies like 'A Night to Remember' have already been made, so why not tell the story of the Lusitania disaster, or something else that actually NEEDS to be told on film? So, if you like ham-fisted love stories with stereotypical, depthless characters and an uninspired, mediocre screenplay, or if you are merely a sheep, then go ahead and watch it. I'll be on the dark side of the moon when you do.

    Starring Leonardo DiCaprio; Kate Winslet; Billy Zane & Kathy Bates So the question is -- is this the greatest movie of all time? Well, it's certainly the most successful. Maybe not the best movie of all time in my books, although I would have to say it comes pretty darn close. That's quite an admission coming from me, since I've never seen a love story that I didn't hate or fall asleep before the 1 hour mark. Titanic is just that a love story, even with the multimillion dollar sets and special effects, it is just a movie about the love two young passengers have for one another. I will have to admit, as love stories go, this was a very compelling one. Certainly, the best one I've ever seen. Although I still can't figure out what all the excitement is about regarding Leonardo DiCaprio. I guess I would have to be a teenage girl to figure out that one, but I digress. I went to see titanic not for the love story (I planned on tolerating it) but for the special effects. Believe it or not I actually found my cold-hearted self actually enjoying the romance between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While, as I've already said, I don't see what the fuss is over Leo, after seeing this film I couldn't imagine it being made with actors other than DiCaprio and Winslet in the lead roles. A fact that I think speaks volumes about their performances. There was truly no doubt, in my little mind at least, that by the end of the movie the characters of Jack and Rose were deeply in love. Heck, I actually even started to care about their romance. (I think I'm getting too soft.) Anyway, as they say, time flies when your having fun, and since I went to see the special effects, that is what I wanted to see. Now to get off topic for just a second, I was one of those who asked the burning questions before the movie came out. Who in their right mind spends 200 million dollars to make a film? Better yet on a film that everybody knows the ending to? If you are crazy enough to spend such huge amounts of cash, why wouldn't you cast some big name actors in the lead roles, so we the audience would have some reason to go? A whole lot of people asked those same questions. If they are anything like me, after seeing Titanic they had to ask themselves -- Why would I have ever asked such stupid questions? Why? Well, because critics are not filmmakers, and while we like to comment on films, and are relatively knowledgeable on the subject, for the most part we don't know as much as the people who make them. This is abundantly true with regard to Titanic's director James Cameron. The same man who many considered would be run out of Hollywood just a few short months before the film opened, is now being recognized as being among the greatest directors of all time. I really don't think that anyone can say enough about the job that this guy did. This brings me back around to the reason I went to see this film -- the special effects. The movie opens with breathtaking shots of the real Titanic on the bottom of the Atlantic, shot specifically for this film by director James Cameron. Although that almost pales by comparison to the special effects used during the last half of the movie as the ship is sinking. The 200 million dollar price tag is certainly evident on the screen. Both in the long shots where we get to see the great ship break up, and in the interior shots that were done in giant flooded tanks. If, like me, you go to Titanic for the special effects, I promise you will not be disappointed by anything that appears on the screen. A funny thing happened as I was watching the Titanic in its final minutes above the water. As much as I was in awe of the effects, and the complexity of the production, something else happened. An eerie feeling came over me. Unlike other disaster movies, this one really happened. All too often, when we think of the real Titanic sitting there on the bottom of the ocean, we forget something. Oh, we remember the tragedy of the situation and that hound reds of lives were lost, but most of us never stop to think what it must have like to be there on that ship as it was going down. James Cameron has captured those last moments, in a way that will make you think wonder why you never thought about it like that before. As spectacular as the special effects were, they could not overshadow a simple love story and the tragedy associated with one of the worst disasters of all time. A truly remarkable film, it is no wonder that so many people have gone back to this masterpiece several times.

    The following review was written by Francesca, an Italian student, as part of her English language studies: The Titanic is a moving film. The main characters are Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet),and they both very well in this film. Jack is a poor boy, but Rose is the daughter in a rich family. One day Jack wins some money and he goes on the Titantic. Rose is also on board the same ship. There they meet, and fall in love, but their circumstances mean they can't stay together. And then something terrible happens... The movie follows a great storyline and I think it is very beautiful.

    I am Dean Scheu. I am from the USA. I have watched Titanic nearly 7-8 times up to now because I like this movie very much. Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie. Thanks Dean Scheu

    Greetings from Lithuania. I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx "movies" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.

    Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurrences was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him. Kate Winslet was astonishing as Rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldn't picture anyone else performing this character. Leonardo DiCaprio was also truly good as 'Jack'. He should have got the Oscar nomination for this character. Their connection appeared to contain all the features that every Hollywood romantic movie has. The two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other. They are both sufficient to surpass as teenagers. James Horner music was simply unforgettable and he forever lifts up the movie that he works on to his ultimate level. Desert leather offers all types of Hollywood style leather jackets. This movie has got to be one of the most magnificent movies of the 20th Century and one to remain unforgettable. It truly mentally hurts me when I don't see this movie in top 200 in IMDb's list. It upsets me when people say that they didn't like the movie. It might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success. Cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled. But it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting. This is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey. Many remarkable scenes of this movie settled on your brain. Not just the disaster or the romance scenes were memorable, but the immense gap showed between the rich and poor. I completely love this film and it gets from me a good 9/10.

    The following review was written by Francesca, an Italian student, as part of her English language studies: The Titanic is a moving film. The main characters are Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet),and they both very well in this film. Jack is a poor boy, but Rose is the daughter in a rich family. One day Jack wins some money and he goes on the Titantic. Rose is also on board the same ship. There they meet, and fall in love, but their circumstances mean they can't stay together. And then something terrible happens... The movie follows a great storyline and I think it is very beautiful.

    I am Dean Scheu. I am from the USA. I have watched Titanic nearly 7-8 times up to now because I like this movie very much. Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie. Thanks Dean Scheu

    Greetings from Lithuania. I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx "movies" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.

    Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurrences was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him. Kate Winslet was astonishing as Rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldn't picture anyone else performing this character. Leonardo DiCaprio was also truly good as 'Jack'. He should have got the Oscar nomination for this character. Their connection appeared to contain all the features that every Hollywood romantic movie has. The two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other. They are both sufficient to surpass as teenagers. James Horner music was simply unforgettable and he forever lifts up the movie that he works on to his ultimate level. Desert leather offers all types of Hollywood style leather jackets. This movie has got to be one of the most magnificent movies of the 20th Century and one to remain unforgettable. It truly mentally hurts me when I don't see this movie in top 200 in IMDb's list. It upsets me when people say that they didn't like the movie. It might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success. Cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled. But it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting. This is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey. Many remarkable scenes of this movie settled on your brain. Not just the disaster or the romance scenes were memorable, but the immense gap showed between the rich and poor. I completely love this film and it gets from me a good 9/10.

    When I first watched Titanic, I was mesmerized. Everything about it enthralled me, and it became an instant favorite. Titanic has something for everybody- romance, drama, action, and adventure. For me, it was the unique mixture of it all that drew me to it. If you are hesitant to watch Titanic because it is a notoriously sad film, watch it anyway- you won't regret it. Although the ending is a tear-jerker, the final scene makes up for it. As a matter of fact, that final scene is my favorite- because the tears are happy tears, the perfect ending created by James Cameron, who has truly impacted cinema. I watched the special features and was beyond impressed with his genius.Not to mention the music, the costumes, and the special effects which are all huge factors in Titanic's monstrous success (11 Oscars!). Not a single person who views Titanic will ever forget it. I have personally watched it about 23 times, which sounds like a lot, but really isn't. By the time you have watched it as much as me, you will realize that while it has become a little too familiar- it is still one-of-a-kind. There is a reason Titanic is considered classic- it has become the basis for countless other films, defining a new generation of drama. If you have not watched Titanic yet, you are missing out. You have not experienced a truly amazing movie until you have cried and said to yourself "I will never let go!"

    Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond. The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.

    Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.

    What I cannot stand are the genre of people who not only cannot conjure a single logical reason for liking this film, but who cannot even write in proper English! Give me a BREAK! I, as a person who has been completely spellbound by the story of the (actual) Titanic for more than a decade, cannot understand why this film has become so popular and successful among audiences when it takes the real event that has become so famous and totally BUTCHERS it, before essentially using $200 million Scotch tape to put it back together in a way that can cater to James Cameron's need to create a soapy, poorly written romance. Seriously, people, if you want a GOOD historical romance, watch 'Gone With the Wind', or something else like that, but PLEASE, in the name of GOD, do something with your time that matters, like, you know, maybe actually learning the true story of the Titanic, a story more fascinating and ironic than anything even the greatest writers or movie makers could ever create. Another thing that irks me is the fact that people defend this film by speaking of the 'beauty' of it's story. Beauty, what beauty? Alright, here is what you people are trying to tell me: you think that a story about sin is 'beautiful.' Yes, that is what this movie is really about, SIN. It's about a 17 year old girl and boy having sex only two days after they've met, out of wedlock, and only after they've essentially done three things: He keeps her from killing herself, they dance in the Third Class General Room, he draws a sketch of her lying naked on a couch, and then they have sex. It's absolutely disgusting. And what's even more disgusting is the way they portray the social structure onboard the ship: First Class is supposed to be the symbol of greed and power, while Third Class is supposed to symbolize heroism and selflessness. So, in Cameron's words, the sacrifices made by Ida and Isador Strauss, who died together as husband and wife, don't mater, just like the death of almost the entire Allison family doesn't matter, just like First Class gentlemen giving up their lives so that others may be saved, doesn't matter. And what the HELL is with the way he portrays what happened in Third Class. He shows the crew forcibly keeping Third Class passengers from getting to the boat deck so that the First and Second classes can depart first, when, in reality, Third Class was simply neglected to death. It wasn't that they were prominently kept down, it's that they didn't know what to do in order to save themselves... There were vast language boundaries, and the White Star Line had very few translators. There were, in fact, gates dividing the different classes, but they were in place under the dictation of Immigration Laws, not because of outright discrimination. And why, when they show the Titanic leaving Southampton on April 10, do they show the weather as being sunny and clear, when, in reality (photographic evidence supports this), it was gray and overcast, but calm nonetheless. Didn't Cameron do any historical research whatsoever!? It's sad to see a man who seems to care enough about the ship to explore it with the depth that he did make such a poorly conceived piece of garbage and call it a film. Not only that, but movies like 'A Night to Remember' have already been made, so why not tell the story of the Lusitania disaster, or something else that actually NEEDS to be told on film? So, if you like ham-fisted love stories with stereotypical, depthless characters and an uninspired, mediocre screenplay, or if you are merely a sheep, then go ahead and watch it. I'll be on the dark side of the moon when you do.

    Starring Leonardo DiCaprio; Kate Winslet; Billy Zane & Kathy Bates So the question is -- is this the greatest movie of all time? Well, it's certainly the most successful. Maybe not the best movie of all time in my books, although I would have to say it comes pretty darn close. That's quite an admission coming from me, since I've never seen a love story that I didn't hate or fall asleep before the 1 hour mark. Titanic is just that a love story, even with the multimillion dollar sets and special effects, it is just a movie about the love two young passengers have for one another. I will have to admit, as love stories go, this was a very compelling one. Certainly, the best one I've ever seen. Although I still can't figure out what all the excitement is about regarding Leonardo DiCaprio. I guess I would have to be a teenage girl to figure out that one, but I digress. I went to see titanic not for the love story (I planned on tolerating it) but for the special effects. Believe it or not I actually found my cold-hearted self actually enjoying the romance between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While, as I've already said, I don't see what the fuss is over Leo, after seeing this film I couldn't imagine it being made with actors other than DiCaprio and Winslet in the lead roles. A fact that I think speaks volumes about their performances. There was truly no doubt, in my little mind at least, that by the end of the movie the characters of Jack and Rose were deeply in love. Heck, I actually even started to care about their romance. (I think I'm getting too soft.) Anyway, as they say, time flies when your having fun, and since I went to see the special effects, that is what I wanted to see. Now to get off topic for just a second, I was one of those who asked the burning questions before the movie came out. Who in their right mind spends 200 million dollars to make a film? Better yet on a film that everybody knows the ending to? If you are crazy enough to spend such huge amounts of cash, why wouldn't you cast some big name actors in the lead roles, so we the audience would have some reason to go? A whole lot of people asked those same questions. If they are anything like me, after seeing Titanic they had to ask themselves -- Why would I have ever asked such stupid questions? Why? Well, because critics are not filmmakers, and while we like to comment on films, and are relatively knowledgeable on the subject, for the most part we don't know as much as the people who make them. This is abundantly true with regard to Titanic's director James Cameron. The same man who many considered would be run out of Hollywood just a few short months before the film opened, is now being recognized as being among the greatest directors of all time. I really don't think that anyone can say enough about the job that this guy did. This brings me back around to the reason I went to see this film -- the special effects. The movie opens with breathtaking shots of the real Titanic on the bottom of the Atlantic, shot specifically for this film by director James Cameron. Although that almost pales by comparison to the special effects used during the last half of the movie as the ship is sinking. The 200 million dollar price tag is certainly evident on the screen. Both in the long shots where we get to see the great ship break up, and in the interior shots that were done in giant flooded tanks. If, like me, you go to Titanic for the special effects, I promise you will not be disappointed by anything that appears on the screen. A funny thing happened as I was watching the Titanic in its final minutes above the water. As much as I was in awe of the effects, and the complexity of the production, something else happened. An eerie feeling came over me. Unlike other disaster movies, this one really happened. All too often, when we think of the real Titanic sitting there on the bottom of the ocean, we forget something. Oh, we remember the tragedy of the situation and that hound reds of lives were lost, but most of us never stop to think what it must have like to be there on that ship as it was going down. James Cameron has captured those last moments, in a way that will make you think wonder why you never thought about it like that before. As spectacular as the special effects were, they could not overshadow a simple love story and the tragedy associated with one of the worst disasters of all time. A truly remarkable film, it is no wonder that so many people have gone back to this masterpiece several times.

And what's even more disgusting is the way they portray the social structure onboard the ship: First Class is supposed to be the symbol of greed and power, while Third Class is supposed to symbolize heroism and selflessness. So, in Cameron's words, the sacrifices made by Ida and Isador Strauss, who died together as husband and wife, don't mater, just like the death of almost the entire Allison family doesn't matter, just like First Class gentlemen giving up their lives so that others may be saved, doesn't matter. And what the HELL is with the way he portrays what happened in Third Class. He shows the crew forcibly keeping Third Class passengers from getting to the boat deck so that the First and Second classes can depart first, when, in reality, Third Class was simply neglected to death. It wasn't that they were prominently kept down, it's that they didn't know what to do in order to save themselves... There were vast language boundaries, and the White Star Line had very few translators. There were, in fact, gates dividing the different classes, but they were in place under the dictation of Immigration Laws, not because of outright discrimination. And why, when they show the Titanic leaving Southampton on April 10, do they show the weather as being sunny and clear, when, in reality (photographic evidence supports this), it was gray and overcast, but calm nonetheless. Didn't Cameron do any historical research whatsoever!? It's sad to see a man who seems to care enough about the ship to explore it with the depth that he did make such a poorly conceived piece of garbage and call it a film. Not only that, but movies like 'A Night to Remember' have already been made, so why not tell the story of the Lusitania disaster, or something else that actually NEEDS to be told on film? So, if you like ham-fisted love stories with stereotypical, depthless characters and an uninspired, mediocre screenplay, or if you are merely a sheep, then go ahead and watch it. I'll be on the dark side of the moon when you do.

    Starring Leonardo DiCaprio; Kate Winslet; Billy Zane & Kathy Bates So the question is -- is this the greatest movie of all time? Well, it's certainly the most successful. Maybe not the best movie of all time in my books, although I would have to say it comes pretty darn close. That's quite an admission coming from me, since I've never seen a love story that I didn't hate or fall asleep before the 1 hour mark. Titanic is just that a love story, even with the multimillion dollar sets and special effects, it is just a movie about the love two young passengers have for one another. I will have to admit, as love stories go, this was a very compelling one. Certainly, the best one I've ever seen. Although I still can't figure out what all the excitement is about regarding Leonardo DiCaprio. I guess I would have to be a teenage girl to figure out that one, but I digress. I went to see titanic not for the love story (I planned on tolerating it) but for the special effects. Believe it or not I actually found my cold-hearted self actually enjoying the romance between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While, as I've already said, I don't see what the fuss is over Leo, after seeing this film I couldn't imagine it being made with actors other than DiCaprio and Winslet in the lead roles. A fact that I think speaks volumes about their performances. There was truly no doubt, in my little mind at least, that by the end of the movie the characters of Jack and Rose were deeply in love. Heck, I actually even started to care about their romance. (I think I'm getting too soft.) Anyway, as they say, time flies when your having fun, and since I went to see the special effects, that is what I wanted to see. Now to get off topic for just a second, I was one of those who asked the burning questions before the movie came out. Who in their right mind spends 200 million dollars to make a film? Better yet on a film that everybody knows the ending to? If you are crazy enough to spend such huge amounts of cash, why wouldn't you cast some big name actors in the lead roles, so we the audience would have some reason to go? A whole lot of people asked those same questions. If they are anything like me, after seeing Titanic they had to ask themselves -- Why would I have ever asked such stupid questions? Why? Well, because critics are not filmmakers, and while we like to comment on films, and are relatively knowledgeable on the subject, for the most part we don't know as much as the people who make them. This is abundantly true with regard to Titanic's director James Cameron. The same man who many considered would be run out of Hollywood just a few short months before the film opened, is now being recognized as being among the greatest directors of all time. I really don't think that anyone can say enough about the job that this guy did. This brings me back around to the reason I went to see this film -- the special effects. The movie opens with breathtaking shots of the real Titanic on the bottom of the Atlantic, shot specifically for this film by director James Cameron. Although that almost pales by comparison to the special effects used during the last half of the movie as the ship is sinking. The 200 million dollar price tag is certainly evident on the screen. Both in the long shots where we get to see the great ship break up, and in the interior shots that were done in giant flooded tanks. If, like me, you go to Titanic for the special effects, I promise you will not be disappointed by anything that appears on the screen. A funny thing happened as I was watching the Titanic in its final minutes above the water. As much as I was in awe of the effects, and the complexity of the production, something else happened. An eerie feeling came over me. Unlike other disaster movies, this one really happened. All too often, when we think of the real Titanic sitting there on the bottom of the ocean, we forget something. Oh, we remember the tragedy of the situation and that hound reds of lives were lost, but most of us never stop to think what it must have like to be there on that ship as it was going down. James Cameron has captured those last moments, in a way that will make you think wonder why you never thought about it like that before. As spectacular as the special effects were, they could not overshadow a simple love story and the tragedy associated with one of the worst disasters of all time. A truly remarkable film, it is no wonder that so many people have gone back to this masterpiece several times.

    The following review was written by Francesca, an Italian student, as part of her English language studies: The Titanic is a moving film. The main characters are Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet),and they both very well in this film. Jack is a poor boy, but Rose is the daughter in a rich family. One day Jack wins some money and he goes on the Titantic. Rose is also on board the same ship. There they meet, and fall in love, but their circumstances mean they can't stay together. And then something terrible happens... The movie follows a great storyline and I think it is very beautiful.

    I am Dean Scheu. I am from the USA. I have watched Titanic nearly 7-8 times up to now because I like this movie very much. Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie. Thanks Dean Scheu

    Greetings from Lithuania. I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx "movies" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.

    Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurrences was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him. Kate Winslet was astonishing as Rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldn't picture anyone else performing this character. Leonardo DiCaprio was also truly good as 'Jack'. He should have got the Oscar nomination for this character. Their connection appeared to contain all the features that every Hollywood romantic movie has. The two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other. They are both sufficient to surpass as teenagers. James Horner music was simply unforgettable and he forever lifts up the movie that he works on to his ultimate level. Desert leather offers all types of Hollywood style leather jackets. This movie has got to be one of the most magnificent movies of the 20th Century and one to remain unforgettable. It truly mentally hurts me when I don't see this movie in top 200 in IMDb's list. It upsets me when people say that they didn't like the movie. It might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success. Cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled. But it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting. This is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey. Many remarkable scenes of this movie settled on your brain. Not just the disaster or the romance scenes were memorable, but the immense gap showed between the rich and poor. I completely love this film and it gets from me a good 9/10.

    When I first watched Titanic, I was mesmerized. Everything about it enthralled me, and it became an instant favorite. Titanic has something for everybody- romance, drama, action, and adventure. For me, it was the unique mixture of it all that drew me to it. If you are hesitant to watch Titanic because it is a notoriously sad film, watch it anyway- you won't regret it. Although the ending is a tear-jerker, the final scene makes up for it. As a matter of fact, that final scene is my favorite- because the tears are happy tears, the perfect ending created by James Cameron, who has truly impacted cinema. I watched the special features and was beyond impressed with his genius.Not to mention the music, the costumes, and the special effects which are all huge factors in Titanic's monstrous success (11 Oscars!). Not a single person who views Titanic will ever forget it. I have personally watched it about 23 times, which sounds like a lot, but really isn't. By the time you have watched it as much as me, you will realize that while it has become a little too familiar- it is still one-of-a-kind. There is a reason Titanic is considered classic- it has become the basis for countless other films, defining a new generation of drama. If you have not watched Titanic yet, you are missing out. You have not experienced a truly amazing movie until you have cried and said to yourself "I will never let go!"

    Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond. The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.

    Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.

    What I cannot stand are the genre of people who not only cannot conjure a single logical reason for liking this film, but who cannot even write in proper English! Give me a BREAK! I, as a person who has been completely spellbound by the story of the (actual) Titanic for more than a decade, cannot understand why this film has become so popular and successful among audiences when it takes the real event that has become so famous and totally BUTCHERS it, before essentially using $200 million Scotch tape to put it back together in a way that can cater to James Cameron's need to create a soapy, poorly written romance. Seriously, people, if you want a GOOD historical romance, watch 'Gone With the Wind', or something else like that, but PLEASE, in the name of GOD, do something with your time that matters, like, you know, maybe actually learning the true story of the Titanic, a story more fascinating and ironic than anything even the greatest writers or movie makers could ever create. Another thing that irks me is the fact that people defend this film by speaking of the 'beauty' of it's story. Beauty, what beauty? Alright, here is what you people are trying to tell me: you think that a story about sin is 'beautiful.' Yes, that is what this movie is really about, SIN. It's about a 17 year old girl and boy having sex only two days after they've met, out of wedlock, and only after they've essentially done three things: He keeps her from killing herself, they dance in the Third Class General Room, he draws a sketch of her lying naked on a couch, and then they have sex. It's absolutely disgusting. And what's even more disgusting is the way they portray the social structure onboard the ship: First Class is supposed to be the symbol of greed and power, while Third Class is supposed to symbolize heroism and selflessness. So, in Cameron's words, the sacrifices made by Ida and Isador Strauss, who died together as husband and wife, don't mater, just like the death of almost the entire Allison family doesn't matter, just like First Class gentlemen giving up their lives so that others may be saved, doesn't matter. And what the HELL is with the way he portrays what happened in Third Class. He shows the crew forcibly keeping Third Class passengers from getting to the boat deck so that the First and Second classes can depart first, when, in reality, Third Class was simply neglected to death. It wasn't that they were prominently kept down, it's that they didn't know what to do in order to save themselves... There were vast language boundaries, and the White Star Line had very few translators. There were, in fact, gates dividing the different classes, but they were in place under the dictation of Immigration Laws, not because of outright discrimination. And why, when they show the Titanic leaving Southampton on April 10, do they show the weather as being sunny and clear, when, in reality (photographic evidence supports this), it was gray and overcast, but calm nonetheless. Didn't Cameron do any historical research whatsoever!? It's sad to see a man who seems to care enough about the ship to explore it with the depth that he did make such a poorly conceived piece of garbage and call it a film. Not only that, but movies like 'A Night to Remember' have already been made, so why not tell the story of the Lusitania disaster, or something else that actually NEEDS to be told on film? So, if you like ham-fisted love stories with stereotypical, depthless characters and an uninspired, mediocre screenplay, or if you are merely a sheep, then go ahead and watch it. I'll be on the dark side of the moon when you do.

    When I first watched Titanic, I was mesmerized. Everything about it enthralled me, and it became an instant favorite. Titanic has something for everybody- romance, drama, action, and adventure. For me, it was the unique mixture of it all that drew me to it. If you are hesitant to watch Titanic because it is a notoriously sad film, watch it anyway- you won't regret it. Although the ending is a tear-jerker, the final scene makes up for it. As a matter of fact, that final scene is my favorite- because the tears are happy tears, the perfect ending created by James Cameron, who has truly impacted cinema. I watched the special features and was beyond impressed with his genius.Not to mention the music, the costumes, and the special effects which are all huge factors in Titanic's monstrous success (11 Oscars!). Not a single person who views Titanic will ever forget it. I have personally watched it about 23 times, which sounds like a lot, but really isn't. By the time you have watched it as much as me, you will realize that while it has become a little too familiar- it is still one-of-a-kind. There is a reason Titanic is considered classic- it has become the basis for countless other films, defining a new generation of drama. If you have not watched Titanic yet, you are missing out. You have not experienced a truly amazing movie until you have cried and said to yourself "I will never let go!"

    Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond. The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.

    Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.

    What I cannot stand are the genre of people who not only cannot conjure a single logical reason for liking this film, but who cannot even write in proper English! Give me a BREAK! I, as a person who has been completely spellbound by the story of the (actual) Titanic for more than a decade, cannot understand why this film has become so popular and successful among audiences when it takes the real event that has become so famous and totally BUTCHERS it, before essentially using $200 million Scotch tape to put it back together in a way that can cater to James Cameron's need to create a soapy, poorly written romance. Seriously, people, if you want a GOOD historical romance, watch 'Gone With the Wind', or something else like that, but PLEASE, in the name of GOD, do something with your time that matters, like, you know, maybe actually learning the true story of the Titanic, a story more fascinating and ironic than anything even the greatest writers or movie makers could ever create. Another thing that irks me is the fact that people defend this film by speaking of the 'beauty' of it's story. Beauty, what beauty? Alright, here is what you people are trying to tell me: you think that a story about sin is 'beautiful.' Yes, that is what this movie is really about, SIN. It's about a 17 year old girl and boy having sex only two days after they've met, out of wedlock, and only after they've essentially done three things: He keeps her from killing herself, they dance in the Third Class General Room, he draws a sketch of her lying naked on a couch, and then they have sex. It's absolutely disgusting. And what's even more disgusting is the way they portray the social structure onboard the ship: First Class is supposed to be the symbol of greed and power, while Third Class is supposed to symbolize heroism and selflessness. So, in Cameron's words, the sacrifices made by Ida and Isador Strauss, who died together as husband and wife, don't mater, just like the death of almost the entire Allison family doesn't matter, just like First Class gentlemen giving up their lives so that others may be saved, doesn't matter. And what the HELL is with the way he portrays what happened in Third Class. He shows the crew forcibly keeping Third Class passengers from getting to the boat deck so that the First and Second classes can depart first, when, in reality, Third Class was simply neglected to death. It wasn't that they were prominently kept down, it's that they didn't know what to do in order to save themselves... There were vast language boundaries, and the White Star Line had very few translators. There were, in fact, gates dividing the different classes, but they were in place under the dictation of Immigration Laws, not because of outright discrimination. And why, when they show the Titanic leaving Southampton on April 10, do they show the weather as being sunny and clear, when, in reality (photographic evidence supports this), it was gray and overcast, but calm nonetheless. Didn't Cameron do any historical research whatsoever!? It's sad to see a man who seems to care enough about the ship to explore it with the depth that he did make such a poorly conceived piece of garbage and call it a film. Not only that, but movies like 'A Night to Remember' have already been made, so why not tell the story of the Lusitania disaster, or something else that actually NEEDS to be told on film? So, if you like ham-fisted love stories with stereotypical, depthless characters and an uninspired, mediocre screenplay, or if you are merely a sheep, then go ahead and watch it. I'll be on the dark side of the moon when you do.

    Starring Leonardo DiCaprio; Kate Winslet; Billy Zane & Kathy Bates So the question is -- is this the greatest movie of all time? Well, it's certainly the most successful. Maybe not the best movie of all time in my books, although I would have to say it comes pretty darn close. That's quite an admission coming from me, since I've never seen a love story that I didn't hate or fall asleep before the 1 hour mark. Titanic is just that a love story, even with the multimillion dollar sets and special effects, it is just a movie about the love two young passengers have for one another. I will have to admit, as love stories go, this was a very compelling one. Certainly, the best one I've ever seen. Although I still can't figure out what all the excitement is about regarding Leonardo DiCaprio. I guess I would have to be a teenage girl to figure out that one, but I digress. I went to see titanic not for the love story (I planned on tolerating it) but for the special effects. Believe it or not I actually found my cold-hearted self actually enjoying the romance between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While, as I've already said, I don't see what the fuss is over Leo, after seeing this film I couldn't imagine it being made with actors other than DiCaprio and Winslet in the lead roles. A fact that I think speaks volumes about their performances. There was truly no doubt, in my little mind at least, that by the end of the movie the characters of Jack and Rose were deeply in love. Heck, I actually even started to care about their romance. (I think I'm getting too soft.) Anyway, as they say, time flies when your having fun, and since I went to see the special effects, that is what I wanted to see. Now to get off topic for just a second, I was one of those who asked the burning questions before the movie came out. Who in their right mind spends 200 million dollars to make a film? Better yet on a film that everybody knows the ending to? If you are crazy enough to spend such huge amounts of cash, why wouldn't you cast some big name actors in the lead roles, so we the audience would have some reason to go? A whole lot of people asked those same questions. If they are anything like me, after seeing Titanic they had to ask themselves -- Why would I have ever asked such stupid questions? Why? Well, because critics are not filmmakers, and while we like to comment on films, and are relatively knowledgeable on the subject, for the most part we don't know as much as the people who make them. This is abundantly true with regard to Titanic's director James Cameron. The same man who many considered would be run out of Hollywood just a few short months before the film opened, is now being recognized as being among the greatest directors of all time. I really don't think that anyone can say enough about the job that this guy did. This brings me back around to the reason I went to see this film -- the special effects. The movie opens with breathtaking shots of the real Titanic on the bottom of the Atlantic, shot specifically for this film by director James Cameron. Although that almost pales by comparison to the special effects used during the last half of the movie as the ship is sinking. The 200 million dollar price tag is certainly evident on the screen. Both in the long shots where we get to see the great ship break up, and in the interior shots that were done in giant flooded tanks. If, like me, you go to Titanic for the special effects, I promise you will not be disappointed by anything that appears on the screen. A funny thing happened as I was watching the Titanic in its final minutes above the water. As much as I was in awe of the effects, and the complexity of the production, something else happened. An eerie feeling came over me. Unlike other disaster movies, this one really happened. All too often, when we think of the real Titanic sitting there on the bottom of the ocean, we forget something. Oh, we remember the tragedy of the situation and that hound reds of lives were lost, but most of us never stop to think what it must have like to be there on that ship as it was going down. James Cameron has captured those last moments, in a way that will make you think wonder why you never thought about it like that before. As spectacular as the special effects were, they could not overshadow a simple love story and the tragedy associated with one of the worst disasters of all time. A truly remarkable film, it is no wonder that so many people have gone back to this masterpiece several times.

    The following review was written by Francesca, an Italian student, as part of her English language studies: The Titanic is a moving film. The main characters are Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet),and they both very well in this film. Jack is a poor boy, but Rose is the daughter in a rich family. One day Jack wins some money and he goes on the Titantic. Rose is also on board the same ship. There they meet, and fall in love, but their circumstances mean they can't stay together. And then something terrible happens... The movie follows a great storyline and I think it is very beautiful.

    I am Dean Scheu. I am from the USA. I have watched Titanic nearly 7-8 times up to now because I like this movie very much. Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie. Thanks Dean Scheu

    Greetings from Lithuania. I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx "movies" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.

    Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurrences was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him. Kate Winslet was astonishing as Rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldn't picture anyone else performing this character. Leonardo DiCaprio was also truly good as 'Jack'. He should have got the Oscar nomination for this character. Their connection appeared to contain all the features that every Hollywood romantic movie has. The two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other. They are both sufficient to surpass as teenagers. James Horner music was simply unforgettable and he forever lifts up the movie that he works on to his ultimate level. Desert leather offers all types of Hollywood style leather jackets. This movie has got to be one of the most magnificent movies of the 20th Century and one to remain unforgettable. It truly mentally hurts me when I don't see this movie in top 200 in IMDb's list. It upsets me when people say that they didn't like the movie. It might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success. Cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled. But it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting. This is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey. Many remarkable scenes of this movie settled on your brain. Not just the disaster or the romance scenes were memorable, but the immense gap showed between the rich and poor. I completely love this film and it gets from me a good 9/10.

An eerie feeling came over me. Unlike other disaster movies, this one really happened. All too often, when we think of the real Titanic sitting there on the bottom of the ocean, we forget something. Oh, we remember the tragedy of the situation and that hound reds of lives were lost, but most of us never stop to think what it must have like to be there on that ship as it was going down. James Cameron has captured those last moments, in a way that will make you think wonder why you never thought about it like that before. As spectacular as the special effects were, they could not overshadow a simple love story and the tragedy associated with one of the worst disasters of all time. A truly remarkable film, it is no wonder that so many people have gone back to this masterpiece several times.

    The following review was written by Francesca, an Italian student, as part of her English language studies: The Titanic is a moving film. The main characters are Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet),and they both very well in this film. Jack is a poor boy, but Rose is the daughter in a rich family. One day Jack wins some money and he goes on the Titantic. Rose is also on board the same ship. There they meet, and fall in love, but their circumstances mean they can't stay together. And then something terrible happens... The movie follows a great storyline and I think it is very beautiful.

    I am Dean Scheu. I am from the USA. I have watched Titanic nearly 7-8 times up to now because I like this movie very much. Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie. Thanks Dean Scheu

    Greetings from Lithuania. I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx "movies" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.
