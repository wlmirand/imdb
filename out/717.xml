    Demi Moore plays Annie Laird, a single mother with a teenage son named Oliver(played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt) who is chosen to serve on the jury of a big mafia trial. Alec Baldwin plays a mysterious hit man known as "The Teacher", who is hired by the mob to intimidate Annie into insuring that the jury comes back with a not guilty verdict. After this is accomplished, Baldwin is still so taken with Annie that he can't let her go, escalating matters out-of-control as the whole scheme is threatened. Anne Heche is memorable as Annie's best friend Juliet,as is James Gandolfini as a mob associate. Though features good actors trying their best, and is surprisingly compelling to a point, it all eventually unravels due to over-length and implausibility of the characters, whose actions over the course of the film are increasingly unlikely.

    Reading most of the previous reviews made me wonder... This movie is a thriller from the word go and total escapism, yet, many reviewers pretend a perfect script, a flawless sequence of events --life like-- without realizing that this is not a documentary, with dates, statistics and absolutely realistic situations. IT'S JUST A MOVIE!! Seat back and enjoy it!! there isn't more than that!! We are not watching an Ingmar Bergman or Antonioni film here. It's just a thriller, and as such, an EXCELLENT ONE!! I followed it in total concentration, being captivated by such superb actors and director and finding all scenes and sequences amazingly perfect. There is not a single word spoken unnecessarily and every one is always in character, plus a great photography and as eye candy Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin, two superb actors on top of being gorgeous. I found this movie above average for a thriller, surprisingly above average!!

    Overall an engaging drama for those with interests in legal plots. But script has taken liberties with reality and the ease with which houses are bugged, reservation systems are hacked, explosives are planned, makes the genre more like a spy thriller but the attempt is not very successful at that. The plot could have had a better focus on the legal drama. Character of Teacher has been portrayed larger than life perhaps for cinematic effects but it has a trivializing effect on the story line. The Jury room conversations were interesting but wish there was more of it as the audience for the movie (as drawn in by the movie title) would likely have more expectations of that.

    This film is a great demonstration of why Demi Moore didn't have a more successful career as a top-level actress, though whether it was the fault of Moore or society is open for debate. She's a capable enough performer, but she lacks the ability to project either vulnerability or likability. With the former, you can trade on an audience's sympathy. With the latter, you can paper over the problems in a script or a production with your own charm. Moore's weaknesses are so clear in The Juror because she fails first at playing the victim and then can't entice the viewer to overlook the obvious melodramatics of the film's conclusion. She also stands exposed when compared to her co-star Alec Baldwin. He himself has always suffered from a lack of likability, especially in his dramatic roles, but Baldwin can manage a bit of vulnerability. His cold-blooded, criminal mastermind here is far more open and inviting than Moore's ordinary woman and mother. It's especially a shame because a different actress, one without Moore's emotional blind spots, could have raised this movie up from being slightly better than average and made it a truly thrilling thriller. Anne Heche is a perfect example, playing as she does a supporting role to Moore's lead. There's an unguarded energy to her acting that makes her characters so much more appealing than Moore's, who cannot radiate the same kind of joy and ease as an essential contrast to the more sullen and terrifying moments in the story. I'll confess to being more a fan of Heche than Moore, but I think my argument is supported by examining the roles and quality of work done by each woman in the years after The Juror. Annie Laird (Demi Moore) is a sculptress and single mother to Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who essentially talks her way onto the jury of a major Mafia trial. That leads to her being targeted and manipulated by the brilliantly evil "Teacher" (Alec Baldwin), a Mafia associate who demands that Annie produce a not guilty verdict. She succeeds, only to find that the twisted romantic obsession of "Teacher" is far more dangerous than any aspect of organized crime. Putting aside Moore's deficiencies as the star of the show, this is a pretty good flick up until and ending that goes over-the-top and all the way to Guatemala. With James Gandolfini as a gangster that serves as sort of a midpoint between Annie's normality and the psychopathic nature of "Teacher", Ted Tally's screenplay put a lot of mostly effective effort into building an interesting dynamic between his two leads. And in the relationships between "Teacher" and other mobsters, Tally defuses the super-villain aura around his bad guy and makes him both more believable and more frightening because of that. And when Moore is able to play Annie as a strong and defiant person, her strengths as an actress shine through. Which brings up the point of why a woman can't build a career on playing strong, aggressive characters on screen? There's a legion of men in Hollywood history who duplicated Moore's lack of accessibility or possessed even worse flaws in their craft, yet were able to prosper in roles that didn't require or disguised their faults. But at least in American cinema, female roles are defined almost entirely by vulnerability, likability or f**kability. Moore has the last in spades but admirable avoided that career path. Maybe the problem isn't in Moore, dear friends, but in ourselves. All in all, I like The Juror enough to give it a mild recommendation. Heche does get naked in it and that's more than enough to tip the scales to the good for me.

    Excellent: Demi Moore, cinematography. The suspense-parts are generally well done, for example where it is not clear whether the boy on the bicycle will be killed or not. General plot: Unfortunately the genre where the good person does nothing right and the bad person does nothing wrong. And innocent friends also get killed in the process. Then suddenly in the last 5 minutes the good person amasses incredible logistics and action, and the bad guy dies. Better would have been some more intellectual input throughout the film from the heroin, such as that she gradually finds out where he hid microphones, and realises that he has her address list, and so warns her friends what is going on.

    A surprise when I saw the ratings here! I watched without checking ratings first; I thought it deserved better. I liked the film on several levels: Acting (Moore, Gandolfini, Heche, and Baldwin), plot (plausible), and suspense (twists, timing, ending). That Moore apparently received the Razzie award for worst actress is simply incomprehensible  I thought she was completely compelling in her role as single mother who is threatened along with her teenage son by the mob unless she cooperates as a juror in rendering a not-guilty verdict for a guilty mobster. Baldwin is evil incarnate  on the surface charming, brilliant, handsome, erudite, sophisticated, spiritual, artistic  all of which makes him more frightening. He is as crazy as they come. Annie finds herself with an impossible dilemma: do as the mob says and save her kid and herself, or do the "right thing" and turn the mob in to the authorities, which would of course place her son and herself in immediate lethal danger. Rather than jump to a decision, she struggles; she goes this way and that, unsure, terrified. I think this is the way most of us would act if put in a similar situation. It is a monstrous choice, a Sophie's choice; there is no simple solution, and the film doesn't pretend there is. The plot interweaves in and out, with unexpected but fully explainable twists, getting ever more complex. I found myself wondering how Annie was going to get out of this mess  what's the answer to this terrible spot she's in, and how will it end? The film does a good job of making us care about how it ends. Baldwin's character is electric  once introduced, his presence is literally ubiquitous, with eavesdropping microphones and break-ins. At one point Annie finds a note left for her in her home: "I will always be with you." You sense he means it, and is completely able to carry it off. His psychosis has invaded her life like a cancer. My only hesitation to give it a higher rating is some rather inexplicable events at the climax ending, but given all that precedes it, easily forgiven. Otherwise, first rate. This is one scary film, one that will stay with me for a long time, and certainly the next time my name is drawn for jury duty.

    There's a rule in public speaking that goes something like this: always know your landing strip before you start. In other words, rather than circling and circling and circling, you have to know how to bring something to an end. Among others, Martin Luther King, Jr. lived by that principle in his preaching and speaking. "The Juror" could have learned that lesson, and it would have made for a far more satisfying movie. Basically the cast was all right. In fact, Alec Baldwin was quite good as the rather charming psychotic known as the "Teacher." He had an air of both friendliness and ominousness to him. It's not easy to bring both of those qualities to a character, and he did it well. Demi Moore (who isn't my favourite actress) was fine as sculptor Annie Laird, and James Gandolfini carried his weight as Eddie, a sympathetic member of a local mob family. Ann Heche was superfluous as Annie's friend Juliet. The story revolves around Annie being selected for jury duty in a murder trial involving the head of the mob family, Louis Boffano (Tony Lo Bianco.) Desperate to get Boffano acquitted, Eddie and the Teacher are sent to threaten Annie, telling her that unless she successfully argues for an acquittal in the case, her son Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) will be killed. Given the nature of the story, I was expecting more jury room intrigue, as Annie desperately tried to get Boffano off to save her son. Instead, as far as I was concerned, the movie got way off track and ended up adding way too much to the story. The trial ends just a little over halfway through, and the last 45 minutes or so was much too much, and began to approach the level of being just plain silly. The mobsters turn on each other, the DA turns on Annie and then offers to protect her, and Annie becomes a gun-toting heroine in Guatemala of all places! Had the movie stuck more closely to the courtroom drama, and Annie's personal dilemma as she desperately tried to get Boffano acquitted even while knowing that he's guilty, this probably would have been both tighter and shorter, as well as better focused. As it was, seemed to me to be a bit of a jumble that tried too hard. (3/10)

    "The Juror" features Alec Baldwin in yet another edgy criminal role not unlike his character in "Miami Blues", which happens to be terrific, while "The Juror" is close to terrible. Everything about the trial is very vague, stretched, and uninteresting. The characters are mostly unlikable, including Demi Moore. So what you get is a highly unlikely story of a meek artist juror submitting to Baldwin's threats for almost the entire film, and then suddenly transforming into "Mrs Rambo" for the unbelievably weak finale. Throw in a ridiculous "how did he do that?" relating to the demise of Tony LoBianco, some questionable motivation, and a general feeling of "no way could that happen". - MERK

    Though a conventional thriller, "The Juror" does feature an interesting subplot involving actor Alec Baldwin as "The Teacher", a criminal mastermind who views himself as an artist, able to walk into any situation and sculpt his way toward his desired objectives. Baldwin's smooth and clever, like all puppet masters are. The rest of the film is poorly written, and notable mostly for both the presence of a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and a fine performance by actor James Gandolfini. Gandolfini plays your typical mob henchman, but imbues his character with a certain unconventional sadness. The film was conceived as a star vehicle for actress Demi Moore, but she's outclassed by everyone else in the film. 7/10  Worth one viewing.

    When Annie Laird is selected as a juror in a big Mafia trial, she is forced by someone known as "The Teacher" to persuade the other jurors to vote "not guilty". He threatens to kill her son if she doesn't commit. When the trial is over, he can't let her go... There are two big problems with this movie, they should have trimmed the ending by at least ten minutes, and Baldwin should not have got his motivation from the T-1000. There are times when he is so autonomous, you can almost hear the mechanics grinding in the background, which is a shame, because in the first act, he is really convincing, but when we find out he's the Teacher, it's as if he's expecting the audience to want him go that little more Psychotic. Moore is as good as she always is, convincing as the parent who is worried for her son's well being. But when Baldwin and Moore are on screen together, it just doesn't convince. You do think every now and again that they will get together at the end, but thats only because the fear factor that Baldwin had in the first act vanishes. Gandolfini is great in this movie though, and shows what a talent he is. Just a shame he isn't in the movie a lot more. There is some good camera-work and good performances, even from your token mobsters, who look like extras from Goodfellas. It's not a bad film, entirely watchable, just not plausible enough.

So what you get is a highly unlikely story of a meek artist juror submitting to Baldwin's threats for almost the entire film, and then suddenly transforming into "Mrs Rambo" for the unbelievably weak finale. Throw in a ridiculous "how did he do that?" relating to the demise of Tony LoBianco, some questionable motivation, and a general feeling of "no way could that happen". - MERK

    Though a conventional thriller, "The Juror" does feature an interesting subplot involving actor Alec Baldwin as "The Teacher", a criminal mastermind who views himself as an artist, able to walk into any situation and sculpt his way toward his desired objectives. Baldwin's smooth and clever, like all puppet masters are. The rest of the film is poorly written, and notable mostly for both the presence of a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and a fine performance by actor James Gandolfini. Gandolfini plays your typical mob henchman, but imbues his character with a certain unconventional sadness. The film was conceived as a star vehicle for actress Demi Moore, but she's outclassed by everyone else in the film. 7/10  Worth one viewing.

    When Annie Laird is selected as a juror in a big Mafia trial, she is forced by someone known as "The Teacher" to persuade the other jurors to vote "not guilty". He threatens to kill her son if she doesn't commit. When the trial is over, he can't let her go... There are two big problems with this movie, they should have trimmed the ending by at least ten minutes, and Baldwin should not have got his motivation from the T-1000. There are times when he is so autonomous, you can almost hear the mechanics grinding in the background, which is a shame, because in the first act, he is really convincing, but when we find out he's the Teacher, it's as if he's expecting the audience to want him go that little more Psychotic. Moore is as good as she always is, convincing as the parent who is worried for her son's well being. But when Baldwin and Moore are on screen together, it just doesn't convince. You do think every now and again that they will get together at the end, but thats only because the fear factor that Baldwin had in the first act vanishes. Gandolfini is great in this movie though, and shows what a talent he is. Just a shame he isn't in the movie a lot more. There is some good camera-work and good performances, even from your token mobsters, who look like extras from Goodfellas. It's not a bad film, entirely watchable, just not plausible enough.

    Demi Moore plays Annie Laird, a single mother with a teenage son named Oliver(played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt) who is chosen to serve on the jury of a big mafia trial. Alec Baldwin plays a mysterious hit man known as "The Teacher", who is hired by the mob to intimidate Annie into insuring that the jury comes back with a not guilty verdict. After this is accomplished, Baldwin is still so taken with Annie that he can't let her go, escalating matters out-of-control as the whole scheme is threatened. Anne Heche is memorable as Annie's best friend Juliet,as is James Gandolfini as a mob associate. Though features good actors trying their best, and is surprisingly compelling to a point, it all eventually unravels due to over-length and implausibility of the characters, whose actions over the course of the film are increasingly unlikely.

    Reading most of the previous reviews made me wonder... This movie is a thriller from the word go and total escapism, yet, many reviewers pretend a perfect script, a flawless sequence of events --life like-- without realizing that this is not a documentary, with dates, statistics and absolutely realistic situations. IT'S JUST A MOVIE!! Seat back and enjoy it!! there isn't more than that!! We are not watching an Ingmar Bergman or Antonioni film here. It's just a thriller, and as such, an EXCELLENT ONE!! I followed it in total concentration, being captivated by such superb actors and director and finding all scenes and sequences amazingly perfect. There is not a single word spoken unnecessarily and every one is always in character, plus a great photography and as eye candy Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin, two superb actors on top of being gorgeous. I found this movie above average for a thriller, surprisingly above average!!

    Overall an engaging drama for those with interests in legal plots. But script has taken liberties with reality and the ease with which houses are bugged, reservation systems are hacked, explosives are planned, makes the genre more like a spy thriller but the attempt is not very successful at that. The plot could have had a better focus on the legal drama. Character of Teacher has been portrayed larger than life perhaps for cinematic effects but it has a trivializing effect on the story line. The Jury room conversations were interesting but wish there was more of it as the audience for the movie (as drawn in by the movie title) would likely have more expectations of that.

    This film is a great demonstration of why Demi Moore didn't have a more successful career as a top-level actress, though whether it was the fault of Moore or society is open for debate. She's a capable enough performer, but she lacks the ability to project either vulnerability or likability. With the former, you can trade on an audience's sympathy. With the latter, you can paper over the problems in a script or a production with your own charm. Moore's weaknesses are so clear in The Juror because she fails first at playing the victim and then can't entice the viewer to overlook the obvious melodramatics of the film's conclusion. She also stands exposed when compared to her co-star Alec Baldwin. He himself has always suffered from a lack of likability, especially in his dramatic roles, but Baldwin can manage a bit of vulnerability. His cold-blooded, criminal mastermind here is far more open and inviting than Moore's ordinary woman and mother. It's especially a shame because a different actress, one without Moore's emotional blind spots, could have raised this movie up from being slightly better than average and made it a truly thrilling thriller. Anne Heche is a perfect example, playing as she does a supporting role to Moore's lead. There's an unguarded energy to her acting that makes her characters so much more appealing than Moore's, who cannot radiate the same kind of joy and ease as an essential contrast to the more sullen and terrifying moments in the story. I'll confess to being more a fan of Heche than Moore, but I think my argument is supported by examining the roles and quality of work done by each woman in the years after The Juror. Annie Laird (Demi Moore) is a sculptress and single mother to Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who essentially talks her way onto the jury of a major Mafia trial. That leads to her being targeted and manipulated by the brilliantly evil "Teacher" (Alec Baldwin), a Mafia associate who demands that Annie produce a not guilty verdict. She succeeds, only to find that the twisted romantic obsession of "Teacher" is far more dangerous than any aspect of organized crime. Putting aside Moore's deficiencies as the star of the show, this is a pretty good flick up until and ending that goes over-the-top and all the way to Guatemala. With James Gandolfini as a gangster that serves as sort of a midpoint between Annie's normality and the psychopathic nature of "Teacher", Ted Tally's screenplay put a lot of mostly effective effort into building an interesting dynamic between his two leads. And in the relationships between "Teacher" and other mobsters, Tally defuses the super-villain aura around his bad guy and makes him both more believable and more frightening because of that. And when Moore is able to play Annie as a strong and defiant person, her strengths as an actress shine through. Which brings up the point of why a woman can't build a career on playing strong, aggressive characters on screen? There's a legion of men in Hollywood history who duplicated Moore's lack of accessibility or possessed even worse flaws in their craft, yet were able to prosper in roles that didn't require or disguised their faults. But at least in American cinema, female roles are defined almost entirely by vulnerability, likability or f**kability. Moore has the last in spades but admirable avoided that career path. Maybe the problem isn't in Moore, dear friends, but in ourselves. All in all, I like The Juror enough to give it a mild recommendation. Heche does get naked in it and that's more than enough to tip the scales to the good for me.

    Excellent: Demi Moore, cinematography. The suspense-parts are generally well done, for example where it is not clear whether the boy on the bicycle will be killed or not. General plot: Unfortunately the genre where the good person does nothing right and the bad person does nothing wrong. And innocent friends also get killed in the process. Then suddenly in the last 5 minutes the good person amasses incredible logistics and action, and the bad guy dies. Better would have been some more intellectual input throughout the film from the heroin, such as that she gradually finds out where he hid microphones, and realises that he has her address list, and so warns her friends what is going on.

    A surprise when I saw the ratings here! I watched without checking ratings first; I thought it deserved better. I liked the film on several levels: Acting (Moore, Gandolfini, Heche, and Baldwin), plot (plausible), and suspense (twists, timing, ending). That Moore apparently received the Razzie award for worst actress is simply incomprehensible  I thought she was completely compelling in her role as single mother who is threatened along with her teenage son by the mob unless she cooperates as a juror in rendering a not-guilty verdict for a guilty mobster. Baldwin is evil incarnate  on the surface charming, brilliant, handsome, erudite, sophisticated, spiritual, artistic  all of which makes him more frightening. He is as crazy as they come. Annie finds herself with an impossible dilemma: do as the mob says and save her kid and herself, or do the "right thing" and turn the mob in to the authorities, which would of course place her son and herself in immediate lethal danger. Rather than jump to a decision, she struggles; she goes this way and that, unsure, terrified. I think this is the way most of us would act if put in a similar situation. It is a monstrous choice, a Sophie's choice; there is no simple solution, and the film doesn't pretend there is. The plot interweaves in and out, with unexpected but fully explainable twists, getting ever more complex. I found myself wondering how Annie was going to get out of this mess  what's the answer to this terrible spot she's in, and how will it end? The film does a good job of making us care about how it ends. Baldwin's character is electric  once introduced, his presence is literally ubiquitous, with eavesdropping microphones and break-ins. At one point Annie finds a note left for her in her home: "I will always be with you." You sense he means it, and is completely able to carry it off. His psychosis has invaded her life like a cancer. My only hesitation to give it a higher rating is some rather inexplicable events at the climax ending, but given all that precedes it, easily forgiven. Otherwise, first rate. This is one scary film, one that will stay with me for a long time, and certainly the next time my name is drawn for jury duty.

    There's a rule in public speaking that goes something like this: always know your landing strip before you start. In other words, rather than circling and circling and circling, you have to know how to bring something to an end. Among others, Martin Luther King, Jr. lived by that principle in his preaching and speaking. "The Juror" could have learned that lesson, and it would have made for a far more satisfying movie. Basically the cast was all right. In fact, Alec Baldwin was quite good as the rather charming psychotic known as the "Teacher." He had an air of both friendliness and ominousness to him. It's not easy to bring both of those qualities to a character, and he did it well. Demi Moore (who isn't my favourite actress) was fine as sculptor Annie Laird, and James Gandolfini carried his weight as Eddie, a sympathetic member of a local mob family. Ann Heche was superfluous as Annie's friend Juliet. The story revolves around Annie being selected for jury duty in a murder trial involving the head of the mob family, Louis Boffano (Tony Lo Bianco.) Desperate to get Boffano acquitted, Eddie and the Teacher are sent to threaten Annie, telling her that unless she successfully argues for an acquittal in the case, her son Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) will be killed. Given the nature of the story, I was expecting more jury room intrigue, as Annie desperately tried to get Boffano off to save her son. Instead, as far as I was concerned, the movie got way off track and ended up adding way too much to the story. The trial ends just a little over halfway through, and the last 45 minutes or so was much too much, and began to approach the level of being just plain silly. The mobsters turn on each other, the DA turns on Annie and then offers to protect her, and Annie becomes a gun-toting heroine in Guatemala of all places! Had the movie stuck more closely to the courtroom drama, and Annie's personal dilemma as she desperately tried to get Boffano acquitted even while knowing that he's guilty, this probably would have been both tighter and shorter, as well as better focused. As it was, seemed to me to be a bit of a jumble that tried too hard. (3/10)

The trial ends just a little over halfway through, and the last 45 minutes or so was much too much, and began to approach the level of being just plain silly. The mobsters turn on each other, the DA turns on Annie and then offers to protect her, and Annie becomes a gun-toting heroine in Guatemala of all places! Had the movie stuck more closely to the courtroom drama, and Annie's personal dilemma as she desperately tried to get Boffano acquitted even while knowing that he's guilty, this probably would have been both tighter and shorter, as well as better focused. As it was, seemed to me to be a bit of a jumble that tried too hard. (3/10)

    "The Juror" features Alec Baldwin in yet another edgy criminal role not unlike his character in "Miami Blues", which happens to be terrific, while "The Juror" is close to terrible. Everything about the trial is very vague, stretched, and uninteresting. The characters are mostly unlikable, including Demi Moore. So what you get is a highly unlikely story of a meek artist juror submitting to Baldwin's threats for almost the entire film, and then suddenly transforming into "Mrs Rambo" for the unbelievably weak finale. Throw in a ridiculous "how did he do that?" relating to the demise of Tony LoBianco, some questionable motivation, and a general feeling of "no way could that happen". - MERK

    Though a conventional thriller, "The Juror" does feature an interesting subplot involving actor Alec Baldwin as "The Teacher", a criminal mastermind who views himself as an artist, able to walk into any situation and sculpt his way toward his desired objectives. Baldwin's smooth and clever, like all puppet masters are. The rest of the film is poorly written, and notable mostly for both the presence of a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and a fine performance by actor James Gandolfini. Gandolfini plays your typical mob henchman, but imbues his character with a certain unconventional sadness. The film was conceived as a star vehicle for actress Demi Moore, but she's outclassed by everyone else in the film. 7/10  Worth one viewing.

    When Annie Laird is selected as a juror in a big Mafia trial, she is forced by someone known as "The Teacher" to persuade the other jurors to vote "not guilty". He threatens to kill her son if she doesn't commit. When the trial is over, he can't let her go... There are two big problems with this movie, they should have trimmed the ending by at least ten minutes, and Baldwin should not have got his motivation from the T-1000. There are times when he is so autonomous, you can almost hear the mechanics grinding in the background, which is a shame, because in the first act, he is really convincing, but when we find out he's the Teacher, it's as if he's expecting the audience to want him go that little more Psychotic. Moore is as good as she always is, convincing as the parent who is worried for her son's well being. But when Baldwin and Moore are on screen together, it just doesn't convince. You do think every now and again that they will get together at the end, but thats only because the fear factor that Baldwin had in the first act vanishes. Gandolfini is great in this movie though, and shows what a talent he is. Just a shame he isn't in the movie a lot more. There is some good camera-work and good performances, even from your token mobsters, who look like extras from Goodfellas. It's not a bad film, entirely watchable, just not plausible enough.

    Demi Moore plays Annie Laird, a single mother with a teenage son named Oliver(played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt) who is chosen to serve on the jury of a big mafia trial. Alec Baldwin plays a mysterious hit man known as "The Teacher", who is hired by the mob to intimidate Annie into insuring that the jury comes back with a not guilty verdict. After this is accomplished, Baldwin is still so taken with Annie that he can't let her go, escalating matters out-of-control as the whole scheme is threatened. Anne Heche is memorable as Annie's best friend Juliet,as is James Gandolfini as a mob associate. Though features good actors trying their best, and is surprisingly compelling to a point, it all eventually unravels due to over-length and implausibility of the characters, whose actions over the course of the film are increasingly unlikely.

    Reading most of the previous reviews made me wonder... This movie is a thriller from the word go and total escapism, yet, many reviewers pretend a perfect script, a flawless sequence of events --life like-- without realizing that this is not a documentary, with dates, statistics and absolutely realistic situations. IT'S JUST A MOVIE!! Seat back and enjoy it!! there isn't more than that!! We are not watching an Ingmar Bergman or Antonioni film here. It's just a thriller, and as such, an EXCELLENT ONE!! I followed it in total concentration, being captivated by such superb actors and director and finding all scenes and sequences amazingly perfect. There is not a single word spoken unnecessarily and every one is always in character, plus a great photography and as eye candy Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin, two superb actors on top of being gorgeous. I found this movie above average for a thriller, surprisingly above average!!

    Overall an engaging drama for those with interests in legal plots. But script has taken liberties with reality and the ease with which houses are bugged, reservation systems are hacked, explosives are planned, makes the genre more like a spy thriller but the attempt is not very successful at that. The plot could have had a better focus on the legal drama. Character of Teacher has been portrayed larger than life perhaps for cinematic effects but it has a trivializing effect on the story line. The Jury room conversations were interesting but wish there was more of it as the audience for the movie (as drawn in by the movie title) would likely have more expectations of that.

    This film is a great demonstration of why Demi Moore didn't have a more successful career as a top-level actress, though whether it was the fault of Moore or society is open for debate. She's a capable enough performer, but she lacks the ability to project either vulnerability or likability. With the former, you can trade on an audience's sympathy. With the latter, you can paper over the problems in a script or a production with your own charm. Moore's weaknesses are so clear in The Juror because she fails first at playing the victim and then can't entice the viewer to overlook the obvious melodramatics of the film's conclusion. She also stands exposed when compared to her co-star Alec Baldwin. He himself has always suffered from a lack of likability, especially in his dramatic roles, but Baldwin can manage a bit of vulnerability. His cold-blooded, criminal mastermind here is far more open and inviting than Moore's ordinary woman and mother. It's especially a shame because a different actress, one without Moore's emotional blind spots, could have raised this movie up from being slightly better than average and made it a truly thrilling thriller. Anne Heche is a perfect example, playing as she does a supporting role to Moore's lead. There's an unguarded energy to her acting that makes her characters so much more appealing than Moore's, who cannot radiate the same kind of joy and ease as an essential contrast to the more sullen and terrifying moments in the story. I'll confess to being more a fan of Heche than Moore, but I think my argument is supported by examining the roles and quality of work done by each woman in the years after The Juror. Annie Laird (Demi Moore) is a sculptress and single mother to Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who essentially talks her way onto the jury of a major Mafia trial. That leads to her being targeted and manipulated by the brilliantly evil "Teacher" (Alec Baldwin), a Mafia associate who demands that Annie produce a not guilty verdict. She succeeds, only to find that the twisted romantic obsession of "Teacher" is far more dangerous than any aspect of organized crime. Putting aside Moore's deficiencies as the star of the show, this is a pretty good flick up until and ending that goes over-the-top and all the way to Guatemala. With James Gandolfini as a gangster that serves as sort of a midpoint between Annie's normality and the psychopathic nature of "Teacher", Ted Tally's screenplay put a lot of mostly effective effort into building an interesting dynamic between his two leads. And in the relationships between "Teacher" and other mobsters, Tally defuses the super-villain aura around his bad guy and makes him both more believable and more frightening because of that. And when Moore is able to play Annie as a strong and defiant person, her strengths as an actress shine through. Which brings up the point of why a woman can't build a career on playing strong, aggressive characters on screen? There's a legion of men in Hollywood history who duplicated Moore's lack of accessibility or possessed even worse flaws in their craft, yet were able to prosper in roles that didn't require or disguised their faults. But at least in American cinema, female roles are defined almost entirely by vulnerability, likability or f**kability. Moore has the last in spades but admirable avoided that career path. Maybe the problem isn't in Moore, dear friends, but in ourselves. All in all, I like The Juror enough to give it a mild recommendation. Heche does get naked in it and that's more than enough to tip the scales to the good for me.

    Excellent: Demi Moore, cinematography. The suspense-parts are generally well done, for example where it is not clear whether the boy on the bicycle will be killed or not. General plot: Unfortunately the genre where the good person does nothing right and the bad person does nothing wrong. And innocent friends also get killed in the process. Then suddenly in the last 5 minutes the good person amasses incredible logistics and action, and the bad guy dies. Better would have been some more intellectual input throughout the film from the heroin, such as that she gradually finds out where he hid microphones, and realises that he has her address list, and so warns her friends what is going on.

    A surprise when I saw the ratings here! I watched without checking ratings first; I thought it deserved better. I liked the film on several levels: Acting (Moore, Gandolfini, Heche, and Baldwin), plot (plausible), and suspense (twists, timing, ending). That Moore apparently received the Razzie award for worst actress is simply incomprehensible  I thought she was completely compelling in her role as single mother who is threatened along with her teenage son by the mob unless she cooperates as a juror in rendering a not-guilty verdict for a guilty mobster. Baldwin is evil incarnate  on the surface charming, brilliant, handsome, erudite, sophisticated, spiritual, artistic  all of which makes him more frightening. He is as crazy as they come. Annie finds herself with an impossible dilemma: do as the mob says and save her kid and herself, or do the "right thing" and turn the mob in to the authorities, which would of course place her son and herself in immediate lethal danger. Rather than jump to a decision, she struggles; she goes this way and that, unsure, terrified. I think this is the way most of us would act if put in a similar situation. It is a monstrous choice, a Sophie's choice; there is no simple solution, and the film doesn't pretend there is. The plot interweaves in and out, with unexpected but fully explainable twists, getting ever more complex. I found myself wondering how Annie was going to get out of this mess  what's the answer to this terrible spot she's in, and how will it end? The film does a good job of making us care about how it ends. Baldwin's character is electric  once introduced, his presence is literally ubiquitous, with eavesdropping microphones and break-ins. At one point Annie finds a note left for her in her home: "I will always be with you." You sense he means it, and is completely able to carry it off. His psychosis has invaded her life like a cancer. My only hesitation to give it a higher rating is some rather inexplicable events at the climax ending, but given all that precedes it, easily forgiven. Otherwise, first rate. This is one scary film, one that will stay with me for a long time, and certainly the next time my name is drawn for jury duty.

    There's a rule in public speaking that goes something like this: always know your landing strip before you start. In other words, rather than circling and circling and circling, you have to know how to bring something to an end. Among others, Martin Luther King, Jr. lived by that principle in his preaching and speaking. "The Juror" could have learned that lesson, and it would have made for a far more satisfying movie. Basically the cast was all right. In fact, Alec Baldwin was quite good as the rather charming psychotic known as the "Teacher." He had an air of both friendliness and ominousness to him. It's not easy to bring both of those qualities to a character, and he did it well. Demi Moore (who isn't my favourite actress) was fine as sculptor Annie Laird, and James Gandolfini carried his weight as Eddie, a sympathetic member of a local mob family. Ann Heche was superfluous as Annie's friend Juliet. The story revolves around Annie being selected for jury duty in a murder trial involving the head of the mob family, Louis Boffano (Tony Lo Bianco.) Desperate to get Boffano acquitted, Eddie and the Teacher are sent to threaten Annie, telling her that unless she successfully argues for an acquittal in the case, her son Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) will be killed. Given the nature of the story, I was expecting more jury room intrigue, as Annie desperately tried to get Boffano off to save her son. Instead, as far as I was concerned, the movie got way off track and ended up adding way too much to the story. The trial ends just a little over halfway through, and the last 45 minutes or so was much too much, and began to approach the level of being just plain silly. The mobsters turn on each other, the DA turns on Annie and then offers to protect her, and Annie becomes a gun-toting heroine in Guatemala of all places! Had the movie stuck more closely to the courtroom drama, and Annie's personal dilemma as she desperately tried to get Boffano acquitted even while knowing that he's guilty, this probably would have been both tighter and shorter, as well as better focused. As it was, seemed to me to be a bit of a jumble that tried too hard. (3/10)

Among others, Martin Luther King, Jr. lived by that principle in his preaching and speaking. "The Juror" could have learned that lesson, and it would have made for a far more satisfying movie. Basically the cast was all right. In fact, Alec Baldwin was quite good as the rather charming psychotic known as the "Teacher." He had an air of both friendliness and ominousness to him. It's not easy to bring both of those qualities to a character, and he did it well. Demi Moore (who isn't my favourite actress) was fine as sculptor Annie Laird, and James Gandolfini carried his weight as Eddie, a sympathetic member of a local mob family. Ann Heche was superfluous as Annie's friend Juliet. The story revolves around Annie being selected for jury duty in a murder trial involving the head of the mob family, Louis Boffano (Tony Lo Bianco.) Desperate to get Boffano acquitted, Eddie and the Teacher are sent to threaten Annie, telling her that unless she successfully argues for an acquittal in the case, her son Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) will be killed. Given the nature of the story, I was expecting more jury room intrigue, as Annie desperately tried to get Boffano off to save her son. Instead, as far as I was concerned, the movie got way off track and ended up adding way too much to the story. The trial ends just a little over halfway through, and the last 45 minutes or so was much too much, and began to approach the level of being just plain silly. The mobsters turn on each other, the DA turns on Annie and then offers to protect her, and Annie becomes a gun-toting heroine in Guatemala of all places! Had the movie stuck more closely to the courtroom drama, and Annie's personal dilemma as she desperately tried to get Boffano acquitted even while knowing that he's guilty, this probably would have been both tighter and shorter, as well as better focused. As it was, seemed to me to be a bit of a jumble that tried too hard. (3/10)

    "The Juror" features Alec Baldwin in yet another edgy criminal role not unlike his character in "Miami Blues", which happens to be terrific, while "The Juror" is close to terrible. Everything about the trial is very vague, stretched, and uninteresting. The characters are mostly unlikable, including Demi Moore. So what you get is a highly unlikely story of a meek artist juror submitting to Baldwin's threats for almost the entire film, and then suddenly transforming into "Mrs Rambo" for the unbelievably weak finale. Throw in a ridiculous "how did he do that?" relating to the demise of Tony LoBianco, some questionable motivation, and a general feeling of "no way could that happen". - MERK

    Though a conventional thriller, "The Juror" does feature an interesting subplot involving actor Alec Baldwin as "The Teacher", a criminal mastermind who views himself as an artist, able to walk into any situation and sculpt his way toward his desired objectives. Baldwin's smooth and clever, like all puppet masters are. The rest of the film is poorly written, and notable mostly for both the presence of a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and a fine performance by actor James Gandolfini. Gandolfini plays your typical mob henchman, but imbues his character with a certain unconventional sadness. The film was conceived as a star vehicle for actress Demi Moore, but she's outclassed by everyone else in the film. 7/10  Worth one viewing.

    When Annie Laird is selected as a juror in a big Mafia trial, she is forced by someone known as "The Teacher" to persuade the other jurors to vote "not guilty". He threatens to kill her son if she doesn't commit. When the trial is over, he can't let her go... There are two big problems with this movie, they should have trimmed the ending by at least ten minutes, and Baldwin should not have got his motivation from the T-1000. There are times when he is so autonomous, you can almost hear the mechanics grinding in the background, which is a shame, because in the first act, he is really convincing, but when we find out he's the Teacher, it's as if he's expecting the audience to want him go that little more Psychotic. Moore is as good as she always is, convincing as the parent who is worried for her son's well being. But when Baldwin and Moore are on screen together, it just doesn't convince. You do think every now and again that they will get together at the end, but thats only because the fear factor that Baldwin had in the first act vanishes. Gandolfini is great in this movie though, and shows what a talent he is. Just a shame he isn't in the movie a lot more. There is some good camera-work and good performances, even from your token mobsters, who look like extras from Goodfellas. It's not a bad film, entirely watchable, just not plausible enough.
