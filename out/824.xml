  When the champ's promoter, Rev. Sultan, decides something new is needed to boost the marketability of the boxing matches, he searches and finds the only man to ever beat the champ.

    At first I was not interested in this film, but then I saw a preview of it and noticed that Samuel L. Jackson was playing one of his slimy characters I decided that I might give it a shot. It was only $1.50 a week at the video shop, so if I didn't like it then I would not have felt that ripped off. I remember when it was on in the cinemas. My sister had a free ticket and the only movie that we could see was this one. I decided not to and used my free ticket to see Independence Day. As I pull this movie apart, I will reveal a lot, so if you do not want to know what happens, read no further. Anyway, this was actually quite a good movie. As the title tells us, it is about hype. It is about manipulating things to gain money and power. The movie is focused around the Reverend (Samuel L. Jackson) who is the manager of a boxer known as Roper (Damon Wayans). Roper is the heavy weight champion but nobody is watching his fights because it is with other negros and as such boring, so the Reverend comes upon an idea of creating a great White boxer to take on Roper, and he comes up with a boxer who beat Roper when he was an amateur. The movie is about manipulation and how power does not fall. It is interesting to note that the Reverend is not defeated, rather he seizes on his opportunity to not only create a champion, but to keep the money rolling in. He tries to keep his champion happy, but Roper wants money, so he promises a fight, one with the white guy. This movie is incredibly well made because we all get caught up in the hype over the white boxer. He is little more than a heavy metal singer, but he beat Roper once and as such is the one who must confront Roper to make a great fight. Everybody believes the hype, and as such we get caught up in the hype. What adds to it is that we believe in the typical Hollywood ending where the White boxer wins and the Reverend becomes nothing. The end of this movie shows us that it is nothing more than hype as the White boxer is knocked out with one well placed punch and does not get up. It is also interesting to note that in this movie money makes everything. The Reverend has everybody under his belt, including the director of the boxing organisation, and what he says goes. When the investigative reporter walks in in his desire to blow the Reverend's sydicate open, he is thrown a job and money and instantly changes his morals. This movie shows us that morals collapse so easily with enough money, and that everybody has their price. This is a movie of corruption and manipulation, set in the decadence of Las Vegas. Okay I have probably given a lot away in this movie, but it is difficult to pull it apart without doing so.

    Weak boxing comedy with mostly caricatures rather than characters, The film comes across more like an idea for a script, with the actors just trying to make it funny. Unfortunately the talent of Samuel L Jackson, John Lovitz, Jeff Goldblum, and Damon Wayans is mostly wasted. This definitely is not a "black comedy", although there are plenty of misfiring "Black" jokes. As for the spectacle heavyweight fight, it is almost a non event, and the buildup not much better. I maybe chuckled twice, and most of the attempts at humor seem forced. Also, there are several scenes that are interminable, and lose any comedic impact they might have had. In short, "The Great White Hype" was a huge disappointment as a comedy and as a boxing movie. - MERK

    The situation is perfect. It's one of the movies where there is nothing bad to refer to. It's about only one match and how it exposes the contradictions of this world; which's here the community of boxing. I loved how the whole characters declare something moral while achieving their hidden, damn materialistic, aims. In fact the shown scene is for America when money is god, and 99 % of the Americans are so godly! The casting is the movie's biggest hit; everyone was in the right place. The script is lissome, coming to its point without any elongation. The characters are made in a way suits the desired in this drollery of a movie. It harmonies smartly, carrying out itself as enjoyable, being an enough compensation from director (Reginald Hudlin) for his previous, real bad, movie (Boomerang  1992). It was so good to an extent forces you to ask why it was that short? Why the gifted supporting actors (Jon Lovitz, Cheech Marin, Jamie Foxx,..) didn't have more on-screen time with more material? Actually, it's not basically a comedy inasmuch as a satire; that could bother some I suppose, since the funniness wasn't as high as the sarcastic criticism, with comic actors around while not making many laughs. However, it said all what Oliver Stone's surely heavier, louder and longer movie (Any Given Sunday) stretched and overload 3 years later, and in focused nice way as well. (The Great White Hype) is a jest where the substance is itself the surface totally unlike the world it sneered at. It's only imperfect point is that some jests can't be used more than once. So, despite how I liked it, I may find nothing in it to be re-watched again (except for Damon Wayans running after the ice cream's van of course !). Finally, do I smell a point of view in the title about how the great hype is "white" in the first place ?!

    The film is about 1:21 and that's probably not helping it either. If this is supposed to be a takeoff on "The Great White Hope" of 1970 fame, forget it. Samuel L. Jackson stars with that amazing wig as a Reverend promoter up to his neck in disgrace. Everyone seems to want a piece of the action. John Lovitz is there as well as a reporter, played by Jeff Goldblum who goes over to Jackson's side for a piece of the action. Jackson has the idea that they can make more money by having a white fighter in the ring against their champ. They get a rock and roll singer who has not lost a bout. The film tries to show that while they all think that racism is not involved, it certainly is. We also have another black challenger who is constantly looking to challenge the champ and when he belts him in the end, Jackson immediately seizes this as an opportunity to promote their slugging to a future fight. The whole thing is rather silly at best.

    Reading through the reviews on here, I can only assume that the humour in this film was wasted on a lot of people. Boxing is one of the few sports that translates well into the movies, with there being a decent number of great films based around the sport. This is slightly different to most however, as it takes a very humorous, cynical approach. There are so many memorable scenes and lines in the movie, right from the opening scene it's spot-on and I really can't work out where this criticism of the direction stems from! The fight scenes are over quickly and are nothing like the real thing - obviously - it's a comedy, not a documentary (sigh). Like I said, I can only assume that the biting satire has been wasted on some viewers who were clearly expecting something different from the film. Each to their own, the film seems to have missed it's audience, but a 5 or 6 out of ten it certainly isn't! For me, it's definitely one of the better comedies out there. It's sharp, funny and well worth watching. 8 out of 10.

    This is ridiculously profane film with a lot of guys who like to say mother-f-this, mother-f- that, over and over. Some of that is tolerable but this is way over the line. Along with that is a nasty, angry tone to the film. It's supposed to be a comedy, but I found few laughs. I did enjoy the digs at the pro boxing scene these days, which is and has been in a sorry state for the last several decades. There's a special dig at promoters, and we all know Don King was the motivation for Laurence Fishburne's role here. I couldn't finish the film, to be frank. There are too many other good movies to waste time watching - and listening - to this. It's a shame, because this film certainly had a good cast.

    Reginald Hudlin's "The Great White Hype" is a satire about what's wrong in boxing. The sport has had its share of bad luck, as it seems to attract a criminal element to what should be a competition between two men in the ring. The film starts with a promise to make justice to the material that Ron Shelton, one of the best writers/directors that has done his share about sports, co-wrote, but it feels as though something is missing, especially the anti-climactic conclusion. The best thing in the film is Samuel L. Jackson, an immensely talented actor who feels right at home portraying these low lives that only he can give them life and even make them likable. We wouldn't miss a movie in which this actor play because he always delivers, as is the case with his cunning character, the Reverend Fred Sultan. He is a boxing promoter who likes to cheat on his boxers, which is what he does to the actual champion, James, the Grim Reaper, Roper. Instead of paying him the money he owes him, he buys him another Rolls Royce. Reverend Sultan comes up with a great idea for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Roper. He has heard the way the champ was defeated in his early years by Terry Conklin, a man that now has a career as a singer. Promising Terry a lot of money if he agrees, Sultan cons him into fighting Roper again and he creates a hype around the fight, the main attraction being, a black boxer, who is a champion, fighting an unknown white man. The racial implications play into the minds of the fans. Everything leading up to the match plays well. The only problem is the figure of Mitchell Kane, a sports commentator, who has been critical of the sleazy Reverend. Sultan takes care of that bringing him on board his team. On the other hand, loyal Sol, who has been with the Reverend for a while, gets fired. Damon Wayans has some good opportunities to show what a talented actor he really is. He knows he can defeat Terry Conklin. In the process of waiting for the fight he begins eating and puts on weight. Others in the film are, Jamie Foxx, who has a small, but effective role as the manager of another black boxer who wants to fight Roper. Peter Berg is clearly out of his league in the film as Terry Conklin a man who wants to eradicate the homelessness in America with the ten million dollars he has been promised. Jeff Goldblum, a good actor, is not convincing as Mitchell Kane. The beautiful Salli Richardson appears as Bambi, an intelligent young woman who clearly understands what's going on.

    Severely underrated boxing satire, featuring humor that ranges from subtle wit to cheap belly laughs. The film stars Samuel L. Jackson (in fine form) as Fred Sultan, a not-so-subtle Don King parody who holds sway over the world of professional boxing. Unfortunately for Sultan, most of white America has lost interest in the sport because there hasn't been a white contender for years. With dwindling funds and a huge outstanding contract owed to his current champion James Roper (played surprisingly well by Damon Wayans), Sultan decides to create his own 'great white hope.' He digs up Terry Conklin (Peter Berg), an amateur who once beat Roper as a teenager, but quit boxing to become an unspeakably awful rock musician. The cast is filled out by Jeff Goldblum as an anti-Sultan filmmaker, and Michael Jace as Marvin Shabazz, a deserving contender who keeps getting the runaround. Cheech Marin and Jamie Foxx play small but entertaining supporting roles. I'm not entirely sure why this movie gets such middling reviews. I guess satire doesn't move a lot of movie tickets. There's also a lot of racial humor in the film (of course), with whites insulting blacks, blacks insulting whites, and even people insulting others of their own race. If that sort of thing makes you uncomfortable, you probably won't enjoy this flick much. But those into sports or boxing will find a lot of laughs here, and this is a great "Guy's Night" movie. (Make no mistake, this is definitely a Guy Movie. There's only two speaking roles for women that I can remember, and both are basically superfluous.) Easily worth a rental, or even a purchase if you find it in the discount DVD rack like I did.

    I'd never heard of this film when I saw it but I was tempted by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson. I was not disappointed. I am not a fan of boxing and know nothing about the sport but this film is more about corruption in sport and grubby business dealings, and is simply set in the world of boxing. That said, the idea could not be successfully transposed to another arena thanks to the flamboyant and corrupt nature of the boxing world. Samuel L. Jackson is deliciously over the top and excellent support from comedy stalwarts like Jeff Goldblum, Jon Lovitz, Damon Wayans, John Rhys Davies, and the increasingly famous Jamie Foxx make this a riotous comedy. This is one of the most quotable films I've ever come across and if you're a fan of comedy you won't regret watching this, even if you don't like it as much as I do.

    This movie doesn't get the credit it deserves as far as satire goes. It pokes a lot of fun at boxers and boxing itself. If you do not know anything about boxing this movie is still very enjoyable. If you have heard of Mike Tyson and Don King you will be good to go. Sam Jackson and Damon Wayons head up the Boxer\Promoter duo. They are very funny together, and anytime Jon Lovitz joins in on the fun only adds to the experience. Jamie Fox is an opposing boxer's manager and as you can imagine, is pretty funny. In the movie, The Sultan(Jackson) is trying to make more money off of his star boxer(Wayons). Their relationship is fine as long as the money is rolling in. However, PPV rates are falling and they need a new angle to get more viewers and more money. The Sultan decides to have "the champ" fight the only man to beat him in the amateur leagues. This man happens to be a WHITE man. This is where the movie goes all out and will make you laugh at racism\prejudices of boxing, and in society in general. Not many movies make you laugh at racism, but this one does a fine job. The movie has a great cast(Sam Jackson, Damon Wayons, Jon Lovitz, Jeff Goldblum, Cheech Marin, Jamie Fox, and Peter Berg as the white Terry Conklin(who you probably know as a director, not an actor). Very Enjoyable movie. It is fun, star-filled, and a good time all around. It doesn't drag on and hits it's marks perfectly. I hope you take the time to watch it if it is ever on.

Peter Berg is clearly out of his league in the film as Terry Conklin a man who wants to eradicate the homelessness in America with the ten million dollars he has been promised. Jeff Goldblum, a good actor, is not convincing as Mitchell Kane. The beautiful Salli Richardson appears as Bambi, an intelligent young woman who clearly understands what's going on.

    Severely underrated boxing satire, featuring humor that ranges from subtle wit to cheap belly laughs. The film stars Samuel L. Jackson (in fine form) as Fred Sultan, a not-so-subtle Don King parody who holds sway over the world of professional boxing. Unfortunately for Sultan, most of white America has lost interest in the sport because there hasn't been a white contender for years. With dwindling funds and a huge outstanding contract owed to his current champion James Roper (played surprisingly well by Damon Wayans), Sultan decides to create his own 'great white hope.' He digs up Terry Conklin (Peter Berg), an amateur who once beat Roper as a teenager, but quit boxing to become an unspeakably awful rock musician. The cast is filled out by Jeff Goldblum as an anti-Sultan filmmaker, and Michael Jace as Marvin Shabazz, a deserving contender who keeps getting the runaround. Cheech Marin and Jamie Foxx play small but entertaining supporting roles. I'm not entirely sure why this movie gets such middling reviews. I guess satire doesn't move a lot of movie tickets. There's also a lot of racial humor in the film (of course), with whites insulting blacks, blacks insulting whites, and even people insulting others of their own race. If that sort of thing makes you uncomfortable, you probably won't enjoy this flick much. But those into sports or boxing will find a lot of laughs here, and this is a great "Guy's Night" movie. (Make no mistake, this is definitely a Guy Movie. There's only two speaking roles for women that I can remember, and both are basically superfluous.) Easily worth a rental, or even a purchase if you find it in the discount DVD rack like I did.

    I'd never heard of this film when I saw it but I was tempted by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson. I was not disappointed. I am not a fan of boxing and know nothing about the sport but this film is more about corruption in sport and grubby business dealings, and is simply set in the world of boxing. That said, the idea could not be successfully transposed to another arena thanks to the flamboyant and corrupt nature of the boxing world. Samuel L. Jackson is deliciously over the top and excellent support from comedy stalwarts like Jeff Goldblum, Jon Lovitz, Damon Wayans, John Rhys Davies, and the increasingly famous Jamie Foxx make this a riotous comedy. This is one of the most quotable films I've ever come across and if you're a fan of comedy you won't regret watching this, even if you don't like it as much as I do.

    This movie doesn't get the credit it deserves as far as satire goes. It pokes a lot of fun at boxers and boxing itself. If you do not know anything about boxing this movie is still very enjoyable. If you have heard of Mike Tyson and Don King you will be good to go. Sam Jackson and Damon Wayons head up the Boxer\Promoter duo. They are very funny together, and anytime Jon Lovitz joins in on the fun only adds to the experience. Jamie Fox is an opposing boxer's manager and as you can imagine, is pretty funny. In the movie, The Sultan(Jackson) is trying to make more money off of his star boxer(Wayons). Their relationship is fine as long as the money is rolling in. However, PPV rates are falling and they need a new angle to get more viewers and more money. The Sultan decides to have "the champ" fight the only man to beat him in the amateur leagues. This man happens to be a WHITE man. This is where the movie goes all out and will make you laugh at racism\prejudices of boxing, and in society in general. Not many movies make you laugh at racism, but this one does a fine job. The movie has a great cast(Sam Jackson, Damon Wayons, Jon Lovitz, Jeff Goldblum, Cheech Marin, Jamie Fox, and Peter Berg as the white Terry Conklin(who you probably know as a director, not an actor). Very Enjoyable movie. It is fun, star-filled, and a good time all around. It doesn't drag on and hits it's marks perfectly. I hope you take the time to watch it if it is ever on.

    At first I was not interested in this film, but then I saw a preview of it and noticed that Samuel L. Jackson was playing one of his slimy characters I decided that I might give it a shot. It was only $1.50 a week at the video shop, so if I didn't like it then I would not have felt that ripped off. I remember when it was on in the cinemas. My sister had a free ticket and the only movie that we could see was this one. I decided not to and used my free ticket to see Independence Day. As I pull this movie apart, I will reveal a lot, so if you do not want to know what happens, read no further. Anyway, this was actually quite a good movie. As the title tells us, it is about hype. It is about manipulating things to gain money and power. The movie is focused around the Reverend (Samuel L. Jackson) who is the manager of a boxer known as Roper (Damon Wayans). Roper is the heavy weight champion but nobody is watching his fights because it is with other negros and as such boring, so the Reverend comes upon an idea of creating a great White boxer to take on Roper, and he comes up with a boxer who beat Roper when he was an amateur. The movie is about manipulation and how power does not fall. It is interesting to note that the Reverend is not defeated, rather he seizes on his opportunity to not only create a champion, but to keep the money rolling in. He tries to keep his champion happy, but Roper wants money, so he promises a fight, one with the white guy. This movie is incredibly well made because we all get caught up in the hype over the white boxer. He is little more than a heavy metal singer, but he beat Roper once and as such is the one who must confront Roper to make a great fight. Everybody believes the hype, and as such we get caught up in the hype. What adds to it is that we believe in the typical Hollywood ending where the White boxer wins and the Reverend becomes nothing. The end of this movie shows us that it is nothing more than hype as the White boxer is knocked out with one well placed punch and does not get up. It is also interesting to note that in this movie money makes everything. The Reverend has everybody under his belt, including the director of the boxing organisation, and what he says goes. When the investigative reporter walks in in his desire to blow the Reverend's sydicate open, he is thrown a job and money and instantly changes his morals. This movie shows us that morals collapse so easily with enough money, and that everybody has their price. This is a movie of corruption and manipulation, set in the decadence of Las Vegas. Okay I have probably given a lot away in this movie, but it is difficult to pull it apart without doing so.

    Weak boxing comedy with mostly caricatures rather than characters, The film comes across more like an idea for a script, with the actors just trying to make it funny. Unfortunately the talent of Samuel L Jackson, John Lovitz, Jeff Goldblum, and Damon Wayans is mostly wasted. This definitely is not a "black comedy", although there are plenty of misfiring "Black" jokes. As for the spectacle heavyweight fight, it is almost a non event, and the buildup not much better. I maybe chuckled twice, and most of the attempts at humor seem forced. Also, there are several scenes that are interminable, and lose any comedic impact they might have had. In short, "The Great White Hype" was a huge disappointment as a comedy and as a boxing movie. - MERK

    The situation is perfect. It's one of the movies where there is nothing bad to refer to. It's about only one match and how it exposes the contradictions of this world; which's here the community of boxing. I loved how the whole characters declare something moral while achieving their hidden, damn materialistic, aims. In fact the shown scene is for America when money is god, and 99 % of the Americans are so godly! The casting is the movie's biggest hit; everyone was in the right place. The script is lissome, coming to its point without any elongation. The characters are made in a way suits the desired in this drollery of a movie. It harmonies smartly, carrying out itself as enjoyable, being an enough compensation from director (Reginald Hudlin) for his previous, real bad, movie (Boomerang  1992). It was so good to an extent forces you to ask why it was that short? Why the gifted supporting actors (Jon Lovitz, Cheech Marin, Jamie Foxx,..) didn't have more on-screen time with more material? Actually, it's not basically a comedy inasmuch as a satire; that could bother some I suppose, since the funniness wasn't as high as the sarcastic criticism, with comic actors around while not making many laughs. However, it said all what Oliver Stone's surely heavier, louder and longer movie (Any Given Sunday) stretched and overload 3 years later, and in focused nice way as well. (The Great White Hype) is a jest where the substance is itself the surface totally unlike the world it sneered at. It's only imperfect point is that some jests can't be used more than once. So, despite how I liked it, I may find nothing in it to be re-watched again (except for Damon Wayans running after the ice cream's van of course !). Finally, do I smell a point of view in the title about how the great hype is "white" in the first place ?!

    The film is about 1:21 and that's probably not helping it either. If this is supposed to be a takeoff on "The Great White Hope" of 1970 fame, forget it. Samuel L. Jackson stars with that amazing wig as a Reverend promoter up to his neck in disgrace. Everyone seems to want a piece of the action. John Lovitz is there as well as a reporter, played by Jeff Goldblum who goes over to Jackson's side for a piece of the action. Jackson has the idea that they can make more money by having a white fighter in the ring against their champ. They get a rock and roll singer who has not lost a bout. The film tries to show that while they all think that racism is not involved, it certainly is. We also have another black challenger who is constantly looking to challenge the champ and when he belts him in the end, Jackson immediately seizes this as an opportunity to promote their slugging to a future fight. The whole thing is rather silly at best.

    Reading through the reviews on here, I can only assume that the humour in this film was wasted on a lot of people. Boxing is one of the few sports that translates well into the movies, with there being a decent number of great films based around the sport. This is slightly different to most however, as it takes a very humorous, cynical approach. There are so many memorable scenes and lines in the movie, right from the opening scene it's spot-on and I really can't work out where this criticism of the direction stems from! The fight scenes are over quickly and are nothing like the real thing - obviously - it's a comedy, not a documentary (sigh). Like I said, I can only assume that the biting satire has been wasted on some viewers who were clearly expecting something different from the film. Each to their own, the film seems to have missed it's audience, but a 5 or 6 out of ten it certainly isn't! For me, it's definitely one of the better comedies out there. It's sharp, funny and well worth watching. 8 out of 10.

    This is ridiculously profane film with a lot of guys who like to say mother-f-this, mother-f- that, over and over. Some of that is tolerable but this is way over the line. Along with that is a nasty, angry tone to the film. It's supposed to be a comedy, but I found few laughs. I did enjoy the digs at the pro boxing scene these days, which is and has been in a sorry state for the last several decades. There's a special dig at promoters, and we all know Don King was the motivation for Laurence Fishburne's role here. I couldn't finish the film, to be frank. There are too many other good movies to waste time watching - and listening - to this. It's a shame, because this film certainly had a good cast.

    Reginald Hudlin's "The Great White Hype" is a satire about what's wrong in boxing. The sport has had its share of bad luck, as it seems to attract a criminal element to what should be a competition between two men in the ring. The film starts with a promise to make justice to the material that Ron Shelton, one of the best writers/directors that has done his share about sports, co-wrote, but it feels as though something is missing, especially the anti-climactic conclusion. The best thing in the film is Samuel L. Jackson, an immensely talented actor who feels right at home portraying these low lives that only he can give them life and even make them likable. We wouldn't miss a movie in which this actor play because he always delivers, as is the case with his cunning character, the Reverend Fred Sultan. He is a boxing promoter who likes to cheat on his boxers, which is what he does to the actual champion, James, the Grim Reaper, Roper. Instead of paying him the money he owes him, he buys him another Rolls Royce. Reverend Sultan comes up with a great idea for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Roper. He has heard the way the champ was defeated in his early years by Terry Conklin, a man that now has a career as a singer. Promising Terry a lot of money if he agrees, Sultan cons him into fighting Roper again and he creates a hype around the fight, the main attraction being, a black boxer, who is a champion, fighting an unknown white man. The racial implications play into the minds of the fans. Everything leading up to the match plays well. The only problem is the figure of Mitchell Kane, a sports commentator, who has been critical of the sleazy Reverend. Sultan takes care of that bringing him on board his team. On the other hand, loyal Sol, who has been with the Reverend for a while, gets fired. Damon Wayans has some good opportunities to show what a talented actor he really is. He knows he can defeat Terry Conklin. In the process of waiting for the fight he begins eating and puts on weight. Others in the film are, Jamie Foxx, who has a small, but effective role as the manager of another black boxer who wants to fight Roper. Peter Berg is clearly out of his league in the film as Terry Conklin a man who wants to eradicate the homelessness in America with the ten million dollars he has been promised. Jeff Goldblum, a good actor, is not convincing as Mitchell Kane. The beautiful Salli Richardson appears as Bambi, an intelligent young woman who clearly understands what's going on.
