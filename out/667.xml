    John Beck & Marsha Mason play Bill & Janice Templeton, a happily married New York couple with a young daughter named Ivy, who becomes the center of attention after she is repeatedly followed by a mysterious man, who eventually makes contact, and introduces himself as Elliot Hoover(played by Anthony Hopkins) who had lost his own daughter Audrey Rose 11 years ago in a car accident, and who is convinced that Ivy is his daughter Audrey reincarnated. The Templeton's are sympathetic for his loss, but scoff at reincarnation. However, when Ivy starts having horrible nightmares, Hoover gets directly involved and takes Ivy/Audrey out of their apartment, which prompts his arrest, and a trial involving the validity of reincarnation, which results in Ivy undergoing hypnosis, with unexpected results... Anthony Hopkins is excellent, and though director Robert Wise imbues the film with some atmosphere, it is unfortunately plodding and overlong, though does retain some interest in the premise, its conclusion is not very satisfying, almost becoming ridiculous.

    Reincarnation is an intriguing and fascinating subject, and each person has their own theories and knowledge on the issue. Or they believe it wholeheartedly or they simply can't stand hearing the thought of it (so, when it comes to discuss about movies dealing with theme they dismiss it calling it ridiculous or if seeing it, they hate it just because). While giving its meaningful and detailed process of reincarnation - or at least the way the author views it - "Audrey Rose" was very compelling towards what I think of the subject, expressing and putting in motion what I believe it happens; the problem is its saddening focus in giving more force to the horror sidelines of the story rather than focus on the magical aspect of it, like in the way Anthony Hopkins character sees it. Story: happy couple (Marsha Mason and John Beck) is alarmed by a strange man (Hopkins) that their daughter (Susan Swift) is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose, killed in a car crash 11 years ago, same date the couple's daughter was born. To make things clear, the soul's transfer to another body is a process like turning the light, on/off, person dies and other gets born, inhabited by the same soul which relives again and again. All I can say is that "Cloud Atlas" presented this in a much more interesting, fun, spectacular way. Hard to be understood at times, but always engaging. The man firmly believes it's his daughter who is in "there" and tries to reach her, while the couple pushes him away until Audrey Rose starts appearing in the couple's child in form of nightmares revolving the accident, and from there the movies becomes like a poor copy of "The Exorcist" with the girl screaming and hurting herself trying to escape from the past tragedy that seems to appear in the present. And she is comforted by the stranger who calms her down. The girl is torn apart between both realities, both worlds and what's really happening? Who will take care of her? And why those things are happening? Because poor Audrey's soul isn't at peace where she is, she still stuck in that wrecked car (?) and now transfered into another body and tormenting such. Flawed presentation and more embarrassing due to poor performances from the majority of the cast (the kid and the father being the worst; Hopkins and Norman Lloyd were honorable and very entertaining to watch), the movie doesn't go anywhere for a long time and when it gets there to confirm what's already known, it just doesn't cause any effect. It looks as if trying to "sell" reincarnation but it doesn't give much proof to that except some coincidences and the horror aspects presented in the form of unexplained bruises, result of the early tragedy. And for a minute I thought this was about to become "Birth" (2004), with some sort of scheme behind the new incarnation, specially after a moment where the child opened her eyes during her nightmare, then closed again, crying, and her parents kept calling her name to wake up. During that brief time she never saw her family standing there? We'll never know if this was a script problem or the girl's poor acting. The quick appeal fades away giving space to a tedious and overreacted film conducted by a good director disappointing for the first time. I don't think Mr. Wise directed this, he always crafted well-constructed film, greatly put together and this was so weak. 5/10

    The 1970's saw the spiritual aspects of the late-'60's counter-culture reduced to commodity. Bookshops and alternative stores became filled with "New Age" paraphernalia and self-help guru's. Western culture was looking for a replacement for organised religion, but what also came with this commercial business which extrapolated ideas from philosophy, religion and even transcendental drug cultures, was the deconstruction of ancient Eastern ideologies. Chinese and Indian religious traditions were ransacked and certain ideas were extracted for consumer consumption in book-of-the-week, escapist fad. It is no mistake that Hollywood cinema, along with the literary industries, collided with supernatural tales. The heavy emphasis on the search for a modern spirituality, along with a deep-seated religious guilt, lead to some of horror cinema's great narratives (The Exorcist (1973), The Omen (1976)), and Audrey Rose took similar root. Audrey Rose was adapted from screenwriter Frank De Fellita's own novel, and uses these cultural trends, along with the omnipresent use of an adolescent at the centre, and the concept of reincarnation as the basis for familial horror. The middle class New York Templeton family are approached by Elliot Hoover (Anthony Hopkins), who's wife and daughter had died in a car crash several years earlier. He then claims that their daughter, Ivy (Susan Swift), is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose. Ivy's night terrors increase in intensity, something that Hoover states is his daughter crying to get out off a burning car. As Hoover begins to get access to Ivy, even her mother Janice (Marsha Mason) begins to believe when he calms Ivy down by calling her Audrey. Hopkins' performance is terrifically balanced, portraying the character with both a sinister quality and the intensity of the grieving father, believing that he is in the presence of his daughters soul. However, the first half of the film is the better experience here, beginning with the mystery of Hoover, as he seems to stalk the family. The second half is a bit of a drag, falling into repetition and over-the-top pop-psychology. Directed by seasoned director Robert Wise, who had dealt with the supernatural in the excellent The Haunting (1963), it does have some interesting scenes, but as a whole it lacks the intensity required for the story. Due to the central theme of the alteration of the child, like so many films of the time, it fears youth autonomy, but with the inclusion of the trend, it does often create inferior visual imitation. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

Maybe the film is dated, with the present behavior of people. The unstable Janice Templeton, performed by Marsha Mason, is an inconsistent and irritating character. Her attitudes are ridiculous and she never supports her husband, even in court when she is summoned to testify. My vote is six.

    I found this film extremely enjoyable as it was so original with concepts about reincarnation way ahead of its time (1977), and I really don't know how it could have been shortened or sped up as suggested by some as it seemed all the necessary information was relayed to us as it only could have been, step by step - otherwise, it would have been confusing. In short summary, a mysterious man seems to be stalking a seemingly happy family, until we begin to learn the family is not so happy, as the young daughter has frequent terrifying nightmares, and pretty soon the man watching her from afar, despite all prejudice from the father especially, becomes her saviour as he seems to comfort her during her traumatic episodes. There is even a court case later on - who would have thought of this in 1977, let alone today - concerning WHO the child really is! I won't say anymore.... I don't understand why this film has received such a low score here, even if the acting and directing are not top-notch, just the sheer originality makes up for whatever might be lacking. I believe we should cherish films like this that make an effort to step out of the ordinary, out of the mundane film world of car chases and bombs going off and inane conversations. This is a film that can make you think, if you let it - hey, maybe, this, or parts of this, are really true!

    While the overall plot of the movie was excellent, especially for that period of time when the subject of reincarnation was new, Susan Swift's acting "ability" made this movie unbearable to watch. Her constant whining and inability to control her facial features was a huge distraction not to mention that she looked as though she had a mental illness. I cannot believe that she was actually picked for a big screen movie, she lacks any form of talent and is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. I looked up her biography and it's no surprise that she only starred in a total of 4 big screen productions, someone finally realized the dud that they had on their hands. The old saying that money talks really must have rung true when her parents took her to that audition.

    Audrey Rose: An Underrated Supernatural Thriller

    Robert Wise may have directed "West Side Story" and "The Sound of Music." But he has done a fair share of horror films and thrillers, including "The Curse of the Cat People," "The Day The Earth Stood Still," but most notably, "The Haunting." However, hardly anybody seems to remember a 1977 film called "Audrey Rose." It is another film from the famed director that, in my eyes, is very memorable and atmospheric. Janice and Bill Templeton are leading a very happy marriage with their daughter, Ivy. The last thing they want is a strange man by the name of Elliot Hoover stalking them. Worst of all, he sets his eye on Ivy. Soon enough, they are able to talk to Hoover. He explains that his wife and daughter, Audrey Rose, died in a horrible car accident, and that his daughter may have crossed over into Ivy. Of course, Janice and Bill dismiss Hoover as a lunatic. But that's when Ivy begins to exhibit strange behavior. Could Hoover be correct? Is Ivy really the reincarnation of Audrey Rose? Now, when "Audrey Rose" first came out in 1977, it was subject to mixed reviews, mostly because it was seen as a horror film, and I can understand why. It was released a few years after "The Exorcist," when horror films were becoming more modern and faith was being challenged. But I don't see "Audrey Rose" as a horror film. Instead, I perceive it as a supernatural thriller with a touch of family drama. And it's a very good one. Based on the novel by Frank De Felitta, creator of "The Entity" and director of "Dark Night of the Scarecrow," "Audrey Rose" is a nifty thriller for three reasons. First, Robert Wise gives superb direction. He registers the exact amount of passion that he had for "The Haunting" and he has chosen an effective story that challenges the beliefs of the viewer. Do we choose to believe Hoover in that his daughter has come back in the form of Ivy? Or is Ivy simply an ill child in need of psychiatric help? It is a great story. Second, the acting is quite good. Anthony Hopkins and John Beck give very nice performances as Hoover and Bill. The wide-eyed newcomer Susan Swift is especially believable in the scenes in which Ivy shows off the nightmarish behavior of Hoover's dead daughter. But I, and many other people who have seen the movie, feel that the greatest performance belongs to Marsha Mason, star of "The Goodbye Girl," as Janice. Once Audrey Rose takes over Ivy, Janice's fear of losing her daughter shows and Mason's acting intensifies as the movie goes on. Third, the film has a tremendous atmosphere. The scenes of rain pattering on the windows as Ivy screams for her daddy are incredibly creepy, and so are the scenes at Ivy's school and inside the banal hospital. There are plenty of movies about possession and bad seeds, but a reincarnation thriller is very uncommon. "Audrey Rose" may be a little long, but it is a super-effective supernatural thriller that is very creepy. It will leave you with questions, and raise ideas about reincarnation. Robert Wise has given us a thriller to remember.

    Maybe I'm biased. When I was looking for something to spice up the Halloween mood Netflix recommended this movie to me. I enjoy paranormal horror films and was looking for the moody, psychological thrill that the 70's horror films seemed to have in spades. That was not delivered to me with this film. On it's own, Audrey Rose isn't a bad movie. Not great, but not bad. I don't know how I feel about Marsha Mason on a whole. I don't think she added the dramatic oomph that I was hoping for from her character, but she wasn't bad or a distraction, which is more than I can say for the little girl. I thought that the actress playing Ivy was awful the majority of the time, non-sympathetic and obnoxiously pouty. But the real issue with the film is that I felt cheated. I was promised a horror story and instead I got one of reincarnation. This film is really more of a courtroom drama if anything. Aside from my issue with how the film is presented, I also found myself annoyed that the filmed seemed to allude that those who believe in reincarnation are the only ones that believe in life after death and can therefore be comforted instead of bereft. All in all, this film served as an OK drama about the benefits of Hinduism. If you walk into it knowing that maybe you can get more out of it than I did.

    I didn't know what to expect when I chose this film out of many in the Netflix horror section, but the title and production year brought hopes of classic eeriness ala The Exorcist or The Omen. Instead I ended up with a deep empathy for the trapped little soul hiding inside Ivy. We can all remember being young and scared and all we want is to run to our mom or dad. That very primal emotion welled up in me when she frantically made her way to Anthony Hopkins to find comfort. A lot of scenes brought back Exorcist-like fears but they were quickly dissolved by the harmless nature of the little lost spirit. Sure the girl's acting was a bit stale here and there but the rest of the cast more than made up for it. In the end it was a very good movie that may bring you back to a few childhood emotions. P.S. It was cool to see Sir Anthony use some Judo. ;)

    In the wake of The Exorcist which presented scares in the form a twelve year old girl, came this by-the-books piece of deflation. In the first ten minutes, it's clear that the story has one place to go. And the movie slowly develops this obvious destination. The odious Robert Wise directs, with some of his schmaltz in check, but no sense of pacing or urgency whatsoever. It takes a hypnotist about ten minutes just to hypnotize his subject. It's not exactly in a hurry, or efficient. Why does Wise stretch all this out so damned long? There's only one place this story is going. At the 11th hour the supernatural aspects of the story are yoked to a very feeble courtroom drama. Wise squanders Marsha Mason's decent acting, and even a nice dark palette he agreed to for this movie (in the 70s! wow). Giving very poor support to the endeavor are Anthony Hopkins at his most effete and irritating, and John Beck whose most complex facial expression still manages only to convey "Gee Whiz!" The long and short of this dud is that it's too long and too obvious.

This is a film that can make you think, if you let it - hey, maybe, this, or parts of this, are really true!

    While the overall plot of the movie was excellent, especially for that period of time when the subject of reincarnation was new, Susan Swift's acting "ability" made this movie unbearable to watch. Her constant whining and inability to control her facial features was a huge distraction not to mention that she looked as though she had a mental illness. I cannot believe that she was actually picked for a big screen movie, she lacks any form of talent and is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. I looked up her biography and it's no surprise that she only starred in a total of 4 big screen productions, someone finally realized the dud that they had on their hands. The old saying that money talks really must have rung true when her parents took her to that audition.

    Robert Wise may have directed "West Side Story" and "The Sound of Music." But he has done a fair share of horror films and thrillers, including "The Curse of the Cat People," "The Day The Earth Stood Still," but most notably, "The Haunting." However, hardly anybody seems to remember a 1977 film called "Audrey Rose." It is another film from the famed director that, in my eyes, is very memorable and atmospheric. Janice and Bill Templeton are leading a very happy marriage with their daughter, Ivy. The last thing they want is a strange man by the name of Elliot Hoover stalking them. Worst of all, he sets his eye on Ivy. Soon enough, they are able to talk to Hoover. He explains that his wife and daughter, Audrey Rose, died in a horrible car accident, and that his daughter may have crossed over into Ivy. Of course, Janice and Bill dismiss Hoover as a lunatic. But that's when Ivy begins to exhibit strange behavior. Could Hoover be correct? Is Ivy really the reincarnation of Audrey Rose? Now, when "Audrey Rose" first came out in 1977, it was subject to mixed reviews, mostly because it was seen as a horror film, and I can understand why. It was released a few years after "The Exorcist," when horror films were becoming more modern and faith was being challenged. But I don't see "Audrey Rose" as a horror film. Instead, I perceive it as a supernatural thriller with a touch of family drama. And it's a very good one. Based on the novel by Frank De Felitta, creator of "The Entity" and director of "Dark Night of the Scarecrow," "Audrey Rose" is a nifty thriller for three reasons. First, Robert Wise gives superb direction. He registers the exact amount of passion that he had for "The Haunting" and he has chosen an effective story that challenges the beliefs of the viewer. Do we choose to believe Hoover in that his daughter has come back in the form of Ivy? Or is Ivy simply an ill child in need of psychiatric help? It is a great story. Second, the acting is quite good. Anthony Hopkins and John Beck give very nice performances as Hoover and Bill. The wide-eyed newcomer Susan Swift is especially believable in the scenes in which Ivy shows off the nightmarish behavior of Hoover's dead daughter. But I, and many other people who have seen the movie, feel that the greatest performance belongs to Marsha Mason, star of "The Goodbye Girl," as Janice. Once Audrey Rose takes over Ivy, Janice's fear of losing her daughter shows and Mason's acting intensifies as the movie goes on. Third, the film has a tremendous atmosphere. The scenes of rain pattering on the windows as Ivy screams for her daddy are incredibly creepy, and so are the scenes at Ivy's school and inside the banal hospital. There are plenty of movies about possession and bad seeds, but a reincarnation thriller is very uncommon. "Audrey Rose" may be a little long, but it is a super-effective supernatural thriller that is very creepy. It will leave you with questions, and raise ideas about reincarnation. Robert Wise has given us a thriller to remember.

    Maybe I'm biased. When I was looking for something to spice up the Halloween mood Netflix recommended this movie to me. I enjoy paranormal horror films and was looking for the moody, psychological thrill that the 70's horror films seemed to have in spades. That was not delivered to me with this film. On it's own, Audrey Rose isn't a bad movie. Not great, but not bad. I don't know how I feel about Marsha Mason on a whole. I don't think she added the dramatic oomph that I was hoping for from her character, but she wasn't bad or a distraction, which is more than I can say for the little girl. I thought that the actress playing Ivy was awful the majority of the time, non-sympathetic and obnoxiously pouty. But the real issue with the film is that I felt cheated. I was promised a horror story and instead I got one of reincarnation. This film is really more of a courtroom drama if anything. Aside from my issue with how the film is presented, I also found myself annoyed that the filmed seemed to allude that those who believe in reincarnation are the only ones that believe in life after death and can therefore be comforted instead of bereft. All in all, this film served as an OK drama about the benefits of Hinduism. If you walk into it knowing that maybe you can get more out of it than I did.

    I didn't know what to expect when I chose this film out of many in the Netflix horror section, but the title and production year brought hopes of classic eeriness ala The Exorcist or The Omen. Instead I ended up with a deep empathy for the trapped little soul hiding inside Ivy. We can all remember being young and scared and all we want is to run to our mom or dad. That very primal emotion welled up in me when she frantically made her way to Anthony Hopkins to find comfort. A lot of scenes brought back Exorcist-like fears but they were quickly dissolved by the harmless nature of the little lost spirit. Sure the girl's acting was a bit stale here and there but the rest of the cast more than made up for it. In the end it was a very good movie that may bring you back to a few childhood emotions. P.S. It was cool to see Sir Anthony use some Judo. ;)

    In the wake of The Exorcist which presented scares in the form a twelve year old girl, came this by-the-books piece of deflation. In the first ten minutes, it's clear that the story has one place to go. And the movie slowly develops this obvious destination. The odious Robert Wise directs, with some of his schmaltz in check, but no sense of pacing or urgency whatsoever. It takes a hypnotist about ten minutes just to hypnotize his subject. It's not exactly in a hurry, or efficient. Why does Wise stretch all this out so damned long? There's only one place this story is going. At the 11th hour the supernatural aspects of the story are yoked to a very feeble courtroom drama. Wise squanders Marsha Mason's decent acting, and even a nice dark palette he agreed to for this movie (in the 70s! wow). Giving very poor support to the endeavor are Anthony Hopkins at his most effete and irritating, and John Beck whose most complex facial expression still manages only to convey "Gee Whiz!" The long and short of this dud is that it's too long and too obvious.

    John Beck & Marsha Mason play Bill & Janice Templeton, a happily married New York couple with a young daughter named Ivy, who becomes the center of attention after she is repeatedly followed by a mysterious man, who eventually makes contact, and introduces himself as Elliot Hoover(played by Anthony Hopkins) who had lost his own daughter Audrey Rose 11 years ago in a car accident, and who is convinced that Ivy is his daughter Audrey reincarnated. The Templeton's are sympathetic for his loss, but scoff at reincarnation. However, when Ivy starts having horrible nightmares, Hoover gets directly involved and takes Ivy/Audrey out of their apartment, which prompts his arrest, and a trial involving the validity of reincarnation, which results in Ivy undergoing hypnosis, with unexpected results... Anthony Hopkins is excellent, and though director Robert Wise imbues the film with some atmosphere, it is unfortunately plodding and overlong, though does retain some interest in the premise, its conclusion is not very satisfying, almost becoming ridiculous.

    Reincarnation is an intriguing and fascinating subject, and each person has their own theories and knowledge on the issue. Or they believe it wholeheartedly or they simply can't stand hearing the thought of it (so, when it comes to discuss about movies dealing with theme they dismiss it calling it ridiculous or if seeing it, they hate it just because). While giving its meaningful and detailed process of reincarnation - or at least the way the author views it - "Audrey Rose" was very compelling towards what I think of the subject, expressing and putting in motion what I believe it happens; the problem is its saddening focus in giving more force to the horror sidelines of the story rather than focus on the magical aspect of it, like in the way Anthony Hopkins character sees it. Story: happy couple (Marsha Mason and John Beck) is alarmed by a strange man (Hopkins) that their daughter (Susan Swift) is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose, killed in a car crash 11 years ago, same date the couple's daughter was born. To make things clear, the soul's transfer to another body is a process like turning the light, on/off, person dies and other gets born, inhabited by the same soul which relives again and again. All I can say is that "Cloud Atlas" presented this in a much more interesting, fun, spectacular way. Hard to be understood at times, but always engaging. The man firmly believes it's his daughter who is in "there" and tries to reach her, while the couple pushes him away until Audrey Rose starts appearing in the couple's child in form of nightmares revolving the accident, and from there the movies becomes like a poor copy of "The Exorcist" with the girl screaming and hurting herself trying to escape from the past tragedy that seems to appear in the present. And she is comforted by the stranger who calms her down. The girl is torn apart between both realities, both worlds and what's really happening? Who will take care of her? And why those things are happening? Because poor Audrey's soul isn't at peace where she is, she still stuck in that wrecked car (?) and now transfered into another body and tormenting such. Flawed presentation and more embarrassing due to poor performances from the majority of the cast (the kid and the father being the worst; Hopkins and Norman Lloyd were honorable and very entertaining to watch), the movie doesn't go anywhere for a long time and when it gets there to confirm what's already known, it just doesn't cause any effect. It looks as if trying to "sell" reincarnation but it doesn't give much proof to that except some coincidences and the horror aspects presented in the form of unexplained bruises, result of the early tragedy. And for a minute I thought this was about to become "Birth" (2004), with some sort of scheme behind the new incarnation, specially after a moment where the child opened her eyes during her nightmare, then closed again, crying, and her parents kept calling her name to wake up. During that brief time she never saw her family standing there? We'll never know if this was a script problem or the girl's poor acting. The quick appeal fades away giving space to a tedious and overreacted film conducted by a good director disappointing for the first time. I don't think Mr. Wise directed this, he always crafted well-constructed film, greatly put together and this was so weak. 5/10

    The 1970's saw the spiritual aspects of the late-'60's counter-culture reduced to commodity. Bookshops and alternative stores became filled with "New Age" paraphernalia and self-help guru's. Western culture was looking for a replacement for organised religion, but what also came with this commercial business which extrapolated ideas from philosophy, religion and even transcendental drug cultures, was the deconstruction of ancient Eastern ideologies. Chinese and Indian religious traditions were ransacked and certain ideas were extracted for consumer consumption in book-of-the-week, escapist fad. It is no mistake that Hollywood cinema, along with the literary industries, collided with supernatural tales. The heavy emphasis on the search for a modern spirituality, along with a deep-seated religious guilt, lead to some of horror cinema's great narratives (The Exorcist (1973), The Omen (1976)), and Audrey Rose took similar root. Audrey Rose was adapted from screenwriter Frank De Fellita's own novel, and uses these cultural trends, along with the omnipresent use of an adolescent at the centre, and the concept of reincarnation as the basis for familial horror. The middle class New York Templeton family are approached by Elliot Hoover (Anthony Hopkins), who's wife and daughter had died in a car crash several years earlier. He then claims that their daughter, Ivy (Susan Swift), is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose. Ivy's night terrors increase in intensity, something that Hoover states is his daughter crying to get out off a burning car. As Hoover begins to get access to Ivy, even her mother Janice (Marsha Mason) begins to believe when he calms Ivy down by calling her Audrey. Hopkins' performance is terrifically balanced, portraying the character with both a sinister quality and the intensity of the grieving father, believing that he is in the presence of his daughters soul. However, the first half of the film is the better experience here, beginning with the mystery of Hoover, as he seems to stalk the family. The second half is a bit of a drag, falling into repetition and over-the-top pop-psychology. Directed by seasoned director Robert Wise, who had dealt with the supernatural in the excellent The Haunting (1963), it does have some interesting scenes, but as a whole it lacks the intensity required for the story. Due to the central theme of the alteration of the child, like so many films of the time, it fears youth autonomy, but with the inclusion of the trend, it does often create inferior visual imitation. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    In New York, Janice Templeton (Marsha Mason) is happily married with the executive Bill Templeton (John Beck) and they live in a comfortable and fancy apartment with their eleven year-old daughter Ivy (Susan Swift). One day, Janice is stalked by a weirdo and she tells her husband. Soon the stranger contacts them and invites the couple to meet him in a restaurant. Elliot Hoover (Anthony Hopkins) tells to Janice and Bill that his daughter Audrey Rose died eleven years ago burned in a car crash and her soul would have reincarnated in Ivy's body. Bill and Janice believe that Elliot is nuts and Bill tells his lawyer to get a restraining order against Elliot. However, Ivy has dreadful nightmares and only Elliot is capable to calm her down. When Elliot abducts Ivy, Bill and Janice go to the court to arrest him. But Elliot wants to prove that Ivy and Audrey Rose are the same soul. When I saw "Audrey Rose" in the 70's, I found it a great film of reincarnation. I have just seen it again on DVD and this time I found it a reasonable film only with a flawed screenplay. Maybe the film is dated, with the present behavior of people. The unstable Janice Templeton, performed by Marsha Mason, is an inconsistent and irritating character. Her attitudes are ridiculous and she never supports her husband, even in court when she is summoned to testify. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "As Duas Vidas de Audrey Rose" ("The Two Lives of Audrey Rose")

    I found this film extremely enjoyable as it was so original with concepts about reincarnation way ahead of its time (1977), and I really don't know how it could have been shortened or sped up as suggested by some as it seemed all the necessary information was relayed to us as it only could have been, step by step - otherwise, it would have been confusing. In short summary, a mysterious man seems to be stalking a seemingly happy family, until we begin to learn the family is not so happy, as the young daughter has frequent terrifying nightmares, and pretty soon the man watching her from afar, despite all prejudice from the father especially, becomes her saviour as he seems to comfort her during her traumatic episodes. There is even a court case later on - who would have thought of this in 1977, let alone today - concerning WHO the child really is! I won't say anymore.... I don't understand why this film has received such a low score here, even if the acting and directing are not top-notch, just the sheer originality makes up for whatever might be lacking. I believe we should cherish films like this that make an effort to step out of the ordinary, out of the mundane film world of car chases and bombs going off and inane conversations.

It looks as if trying to "sell" reincarnation but it doesn't give much proof to that except some coincidences and the horror aspects presented in the form of unexplained bruises, result of the early tragedy. And for a minute I thought this was about to become "Birth" (2004), with some sort of scheme behind the new incarnation, specially after a moment where the child opened her eyes during her nightmare, then closed again, crying, and her parents kept calling her name to wake up. During that brief time she never saw her family standing there? We'll never know if this was a script problem or the girl's poor acting. The quick appeal fades away giving space to a tedious and overreacted film conducted by a good director disappointing for the first time. I don't think Mr. Wise directed this, he always crafted well-constructed film, greatly put together and this was so weak. 5/10

    The 1970's saw the spiritual aspects of the late-'60's counter-culture reduced to commodity. Bookshops and alternative stores became filled with "New Age" paraphernalia and self-help guru's. Western culture was looking for a replacement for organised religion, but what also came with this commercial business which extrapolated ideas from philosophy, religion and even transcendental drug cultures, was the deconstruction of ancient Eastern ideologies. Chinese and Indian religious traditions were ransacked and certain ideas were extracted for consumer consumption in book-of-the-week, escapist fad. It is no mistake that Hollywood cinema, along with the literary industries, collided with supernatural tales. The heavy emphasis on the search for a modern spirituality, along with a deep-seated religious guilt, lead to some of horror cinema's great narratives (The Exorcist (1973), The Omen (1976)), and Audrey Rose took similar root. Audrey Rose was adapted from screenwriter Frank De Fellita's own novel, and uses these cultural trends, along with the omnipresent use of an adolescent at the centre, and the concept of reincarnation as the basis for familial horror. The middle class New York Templeton family are approached by Elliot Hoover (Anthony Hopkins), who's wife and daughter had died in a car crash several years earlier. He then claims that their daughter, Ivy (Susan Swift), is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose. Ivy's night terrors increase in intensity, something that Hoover states is his daughter crying to get out off a burning car. As Hoover begins to get access to Ivy, even her mother Janice (Marsha Mason) begins to believe when he calms Ivy down by calling her Audrey. Hopkins' performance is terrifically balanced, portraying the character with both a sinister quality and the intensity of the grieving father, believing that he is in the presence of his daughters soul. However, the first half of the film is the better experience here, beginning with the mystery of Hoover, as he seems to stalk the family. The second half is a bit of a drag, falling into repetition and over-the-top pop-psychology. Directed by seasoned director Robert Wise, who had dealt with the supernatural in the excellent The Haunting (1963), it does have some interesting scenes, but as a whole it lacks the intensity required for the story. Due to the central theme of the alteration of the child, like so many films of the time, it fears youth autonomy, but with the inclusion of the trend, it does often create inferior visual imitation. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    In New York, Janice Templeton (Marsha Mason) is happily married with the executive Bill Templeton (John Beck) and they live in a comfortable and fancy apartment with their eleven year-old daughter Ivy (Susan Swift). One day, Janice is stalked by a weirdo and she tells her husband. Soon the stranger contacts them and invites the couple to meet him in a restaurant. Elliot Hoover (Anthony Hopkins) tells to Janice and Bill that his daughter Audrey Rose died eleven years ago burned in a car crash and her soul would have reincarnated in Ivy's body. Bill and Janice believe that Elliot is nuts and Bill tells his lawyer to get a restraining order against Elliot. However, Ivy has dreadful nightmares and only Elliot is capable to calm her down. When Elliot abducts Ivy, Bill and Janice go to the court to arrest him. But Elliot wants to prove that Ivy and Audrey Rose are the same soul. When I saw "Audrey Rose" in the 70's, I found it a great film of reincarnation. I have just seen it again on DVD and this time I found it a reasonable film only with a flawed screenplay. Maybe the film is dated, with the present behavior of people. The unstable Janice Templeton, performed by Marsha Mason, is an inconsistent and irritating character. Her attitudes are ridiculous and she never supports her husband, even in court when she is summoned to testify. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "As Duas Vidas de Audrey Rose" ("The Two Lives of Audrey Rose")

    I found this film extremely enjoyable as it was so original with concepts about reincarnation way ahead of its time (1977), and I really don't know how it could have been shortened or sped up as suggested by some as it seemed all the necessary information was relayed to us as it only could have been, step by step - otherwise, it would have been confusing. In short summary, a mysterious man seems to be stalking a seemingly happy family, until we begin to learn the family is not so happy, as the young daughter has frequent terrifying nightmares, and pretty soon the man watching her from afar, despite all prejudice from the father especially, becomes her saviour as he seems to comfort her during her traumatic episodes. There is even a court case later on - who would have thought of this in 1977, let alone today - concerning WHO the child really is! I won't say anymore.... I don't understand why this film has received such a low score here, even if the acting and directing are not top-notch, just the sheer originality makes up for whatever might be lacking. I believe we should cherish films like this that make an effort to step out of the ordinary, out of the mundane film world of car chases and bombs going off and inane conversations. This is a film that can make you think, if you let it - hey, maybe, this, or parts of this, are really true!

    While the overall plot of the movie was excellent, especially for that period of time when the subject of reincarnation was new, Susan Swift's acting "ability" made this movie unbearable to watch. Her constant whining and inability to control her facial features was a huge distraction not to mention that she looked as though she had a mental illness. I cannot believe that she was actually picked for a big screen movie, she lacks any form of talent and is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. I looked up her biography and it's no surprise that she only starred in a total of 4 big screen productions, someone finally realized the dud that they had on their hands. The old saying that money talks really must have rung true when her parents took her to that audition.

    Robert Wise may have directed "West Side Story" and "The Sound of Music." But he has done a fair share of horror films and thrillers, including "The Curse of the Cat People," "The Day The Earth Stood Still," but most notably, "The Haunting." However, hardly anybody seems to remember a 1977 film called "Audrey Rose." It is another film from the famed director that, in my eyes, is very memorable and atmospheric. Janice and Bill Templeton are leading a very happy marriage with their daughter, Ivy. The last thing they want is a strange man by the name of Elliot Hoover stalking them. Worst of all, he sets his eye on Ivy. Soon enough, they are able to talk to Hoover. He explains that his wife and daughter, Audrey Rose, died in a horrible car accident, and that his daughter may have crossed over into Ivy. Of course, Janice and Bill dismiss Hoover as a lunatic. But that's when Ivy begins to exhibit strange behavior. Could Hoover be correct? Is Ivy really the reincarnation of Audrey Rose? Now, when "Audrey Rose" first came out in 1977, it was subject to mixed reviews, mostly because it was seen as a horror film, and I can understand why. It was released a few years after "The Exorcist," when horror films were becoming more modern and faith was being challenged. But I don't see "Audrey Rose" as a horror film. Instead, I perceive it as a supernatural thriller with a touch of family drama. And it's a very good one. Based on the novel by Frank De Felitta, creator of "The Entity" and director of "Dark Night of the Scarecrow," "Audrey Rose" is a nifty thriller for three reasons. First, Robert Wise gives superb direction. He registers the exact amount of passion that he had for "The Haunting" and he has chosen an effective story that challenges the beliefs of the viewer. Do we choose to believe Hoover in that his daughter has come back in the form of Ivy? Or is Ivy simply an ill child in need of psychiatric help? It is a great story. Second, the acting is quite good. Anthony Hopkins and John Beck give very nice performances as Hoover and Bill. The wide-eyed newcomer Susan Swift is especially believable in the scenes in which Ivy shows off the nightmarish behavior of Hoover's dead daughter. But I, and many other people who have seen the movie, feel that the greatest performance belongs to Marsha Mason, star of "The Goodbye Girl," as Janice. Once Audrey Rose takes over Ivy, Janice's fear of losing her daughter shows and Mason's acting intensifies as the movie goes on. Third, the film has a tremendous atmosphere. The scenes of rain pattering on the windows as Ivy screams for her daddy are incredibly creepy, and so are the scenes at Ivy's school and inside the banal hospital. There are plenty of movies about possession and bad seeds, but a reincarnation thriller is very uncommon. "Audrey Rose" may be a little long, but it is a super-effective supernatural thriller that is very creepy. It will leave you with questions, and raise ideas about reincarnation. Robert Wise has given us a thriller to remember.

    Maybe I'm biased. When I was looking for something to spice up the Halloween mood Netflix recommended this movie to me. I enjoy paranormal horror films and was looking for the moody, psychological thrill that the 70's horror films seemed to have in spades. That was not delivered to me with this film. On it's own, Audrey Rose isn't a bad movie. Not great, but not bad. I don't know how I feel about Marsha Mason on a whole. I don't think she added the dramatic oomph that I was hoping for from her character, but she wasn't bad or a distraction, which is more than I can say for the little girl. I thought that the actress playing Ivy was awful the majority of the time, non-sympathetic and obnoxiously pouty. But the real issue with the film is that I felt cheated. I was promised a horror story and instead I got one of reincarnation. This film is really more of a courtroom drama if anything. Aside from my issue with how the film is presented, I also found myself annoyed that the filmed seemed to allude that those who believe in reincarnation are the only ones that believe in life after death and can therefore be comforted instead of bereft. All in all, this film served as an OK drama about the benefits of Hinduism. If you walk into it knowing that maybe you can get more out of it than I did.

    I didn't know what to expect when I chose this film out of many in the Netflix horror section, but the title and production year brought hopes of classic eeriness ala The Exorcist or The Omen. Instead I ended up with a deep empathy for the trapped little soul hiding inside Ivy. We can all remember being young and scared and all we want is to run to our mom or dad. That very primal emotion welled up in me when she frantically made her way to Anthony Hopkins to find comfort. A lot of scenes brought back Exorcist-like fears but they were quickly dissolved by the harmless nature of the little lost spirit. Sure the girl's acting was a bit stale here and there but the rest of the cast more than made up for it. In the end it was a very good movie that may bring you back to a few childhood emotions. P.S. It was cool to see Sir Anthony use some Judo. ;)

    In the wake of The Exorcist which presented scares in the form a twelve year old girl, came this by-the-books piece of deflation. In the first ten minutes, it's clear that the story has one place to go. And the movie slowly develops this obvious destination. The odious Robert Wise directs, with some of his schmaltz in check, but no sense of pacing or urgency whatsoever. It takes a hypnotist about ten minutes just to hypnotize his subject. It's not exactly in a hurry, or efficient. Why does Wise stretch all this out so damned long? There's only one place this story is going. At the 11th hour the supernatural aspects of the story are yoked to a very feeble courtroom drama. Wise squanders Marsha Mason's decent acting, and even a nice dark palette he agreed to for this movie (in the 70s! wow). Giving very poor support to the endeavor are Anthony Hopkins at his most effete and irritating, and John Beck whose most complex facial expression still manages only to convey "Gee Whiz!" The long and short of this dud is that it's too long and too obvious.

    John Beck & Marsha Mason play Bill & Janice Templeton, a happily married New York couple with a young daughter named Ivy, who becomes the center of attention after she is repeatedly followed by a mysterious man, who eventually makes contact, and introduces himself as Elliot Hoover(played by Anthony Hopkins) who had lost his own daughter Audrey Rose 11 years ago in a car accident, and who is convinced that Ivy is his daughter Audrey reincarnated. The Templeton's are sympathetic for his loss, but scoff at reincarnation. However, when Ivy starts having horrible nightmares, Hoover gets directly involved and takes Ivy/Audrey out of their apartment, which prompts his arrest, and a trial involving the validity of reincarnation, which results in Ivy undergoing hypnosis, with unexpected results... Anthony Hopkins is excellent, and though director Robert Wise imbues the film with some atmosphere, it is unfortunately plodding and overlong, though does retain some interest in the premise, its conclusion is not very satisfying, almost becoming ridiculous.

    Reincarnation is an intriguing and fascinating subject, and each person has their own theories and knowledge on the issue. Or they believe it wholeheartedly or they simply can't stand hearing the thought of it (so, when it comes to discuss about movies dealing with theme they dismiss it calling it ridiculous or if seeing it, they hate it just because). While giving its meaningful and detailed process of reincarnation - or at least the way the author views it - "Audrey Rose" was very compelling towards what I think of the subject, expressing and putting in motion what I believe it happens; the problem is its saddening focus in giving more force to the horror sidelines of the story rather than focus on the magical aspect of it, like in the way Anthony Hopkins character sees it. Story: happy couple (Marsha Mason and John Beck) is alarmed by a strange man (Hopkins) that their daughter (Susan Swift) is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose, killed in a car crash 11 years ago, same date the couple's daughter was born. To make things clear, the soul's transfer to another body is a process like turning the light, on/off, person dies and other gets born, inhabited by the same soul which relives again and again. All I can say is that "Cloud Atlas" presented this in a much more interesting, fun, spectacular way. Hard to be understood at times, but always engaging. The man firmly believes it's his daughter who is in "there" and tries to reach her, while the couple pushes him away until Audrey Rose starts appearing in the couple's child in form of nightmares revolving the accident, and from there the movies becomes like a poor copy of "The Exorcist" with the girl screaming and hurting herself trying to escape from the past tragedy that seems to appear in the present. And she is comforted by the stranger who calms her down. The girl is torn apart between both realities, both worlds and what's really happening? Who will take care of her? And why those things are happening? Because poor Audrey's soul isn't at peace where she is, she still stuck in that wrecked car (?) and now transfered into another body and tormenting such. Flawed presentation and more embarrassing due to poor performances from the majority of the cast (the kid and the father being the worst; Hopkins and Norman Lloyd were honorable and very entertaining to watch), the movie doesn't go anywhere for a long time and when it gets there to confirm what's already known, it just doesn't cause any effect. It looks as if trying to "sell" reincarnation but it doesn't give much proof to that except some coincidences and the horror aspects presented in the form of unexplained bruises, result of the early tragedy. And for a minute I thought this was about to become "Birth" (2004), with some sort of scheme behind the new incarnation, specially after a moment where the child opened her eyes during her nightmare, then closed again, crying, and her parents kept calling her name to wake up. During that brief time she never saw her family standing there? We'll never know if this was a script problem or the girl's poor acting. The quick appeal fades away giving space to a tedious and overreacted film conducted by a good director disappointing for the first time. I don't think Mr. Wise directed this, he always crafted well-constructed film, greatly put together and this was so weak. 5/10

Aside from my issue with how the film is presented, I also found myself annoyed that the filmed seemed to allude that those who believe in reincarnation are the only ones that believe in life after death and can therefore be comforted instead of bereft. All in all, this film served as an OK drama about the benefits of Hinduism. If you walk into it knowing that maybe you can get more out of it than I did.

    I didn't know what to expect when I chose this film out of many in the Netflix horror section, but the title and production year brought hopes of classic eeriness ala The Exorcist or The Omen. Instead I ended up with a deep empathy for the trapped little soul hiding inside Ivy. We can all remember being young and scared and all we want is to run to our mom or dad. That very primal emotion welled up in me when she frantically made her way to Anthony Hopkins to find comfort. A lot of scenes brought back Exorcist-like fears but they were quickly dissolved by the harmless nature of the little lost spirit. Sure the girl's acting was a bit stale here and there but the rest of the cast more than made up for it. In the end it was a very good movie that may bring you back to a few childhood emotions. P.S. It was cool to see Sir Anthony use some Judo. ;)

    In the wake of The Exorcist which presented scares in the form a twelve year old girl, came this by-the-books piece of deflation. In the first ten minutes, it's clear that the story has one place to go. And the movie slowly develops this obvious destination. The odious Robert Wise directs, with some of his schmaltz in check, but no sense of pacing or urgency whatsoever. It takes a hypnotist about ten minutes just to hypnotize his subject. It's not exactly in a hurry, or efficient. Why does Wise stretch all this out so damned long? There's only one place this story is going. At the 11th hour the supernatural aspects of the story are yoked to a very feeble courtroom drama. Wise squanders Marsha Mason's decent acting, and even a nice dark palette he agreed to for this movie (in the 70s! wow). Giving very poor support to the endeavor are Anthony Hopkins at his most effete and irritating, and John Beck whose most complex facial expression still manages only to convey "Gee Whiz!" The long and short of this dud is that it's too long and too obvious.

    John Beck & Marsha Mason play Bill & Janice Templeton, a happily married New York couple with a young daughter named Ivy, who becomes the center of attention after she is repeatedly followed by a mysterious man, who eventually makes contact, and introduces himself as Elliot Hoover(played by Anthony Hopkins) who had lost his own daughter Audrey Rose 11 years ago in a car accident, and who is convinced that Ivy is his daughter Audrey reincarnated. The Templeton's are sympathetic for his loss, but scoff at reincarnation. However, when Ivy starts having horrible nightmares, Hoover gets directly involved and takes Ivy/Audrey out of their apartment, which prompts his arrest, and a trial involving the validity of reincarnation, which results in Ivy undergoing hypnosis, with unexpected results... Anthony Hopkins is excellent, and though director Robert Wise imbues the film with some atmosphere, it is unfortunately plodding and overlong, though does retain some interest in the premise, its conclusion is not very satisfying, almost becoming ridiculous.

    Reincarnation is an intriguing and fascinating subject, and each person has their own theories and knowledge on the issue. Or they believe it wholeheartedly or they simply can't stand hearing the thought of it (so, when it comes to discuss about movies dealing with theme they dismiss it calling it ridiculous or if seeing it, they hate it just because). While giving its meaningful and detailed process of reincarnation - or at least the way the author views it - "Audrey Rose" was very compelling towards what I think of the subject, expressing and putting in motion what I believe it happens; the problem is its saddening focus in giving more force to the horror sidelines of the story rather than focus on the magical aspect of it, like in the way Anthony Hopkins character sees it. Story: happy couple (Marsha Mason and John Beck) is alarmed by a strange man (Hopkins) that their daughter (Susan Swift) is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose, killed in a car crash 11 years ago, same date the couple's daughter was born. To make things clear, the soul's transfer to another body is a process like turning the light, on/off, person dies and other gets born, inhabited by the same soul which relives again and again. All I can say is that "Cloud Atlas" presented this in a much more interesting, fun, spectacular way. Hard to be understood at times, but always engaging. The man firmly believes it's his daughter who is in "there" and tries to reach her, while the couple pushes him away until Audrey Rose starts appearing in the couple's child in form of nightmares revolving the accident, and from there the movies becomes like a poor copy of "The Exorcist" with the girl screaming and hurting herself trying to escape from the past tragedy that seems to appear in the present. And she is comforted by the stranger who calms her down. The girl is torn apart between both realities, both worlds and what's really happening? Who will take care of her? And why those things are happening? Because poor Audrey's soul isn't at peace where she is, she still stuck in that wrecked car (?) and now transfered into another body and tormenting such. Flawed presentation and more embarrassing due to poor performances from the majority of the cast (the kid and the father being the worst; Hopkins and Norman Lloyd were honorable and very entertaining to watch), the movie doesn't go anywhere for a long time and when it gets there to confirm what's already known, it just doesn't cause any effect. It looks as if trying to "sell" reincarnation but it doesn't give much proof to that except some coincidences and the horror aspects presented in the form of unexplained bruises, result of the early tragedy. And for a minute I thought this was about to become "Birth" (2004), with some sort of scheme behind the new incarnation, specially after a moment where the child opened her eyes during her nightmare, then closed again, crying, and her parents kept calling her name to wake up. During that brief time she never saw her family standing there? We'll never know if this was a script problem or the girl's poor acting. The quick appeal fades away giving space to a tedious and overreacted film conducted by a good director disappointing for the first time. I don't think Mr. Wise directed this, he always crafted well-constructed film, greatly put together and this was so weak. 5/10

    The 1970's saw the spiritual aspects of the late-'60's counter-culture reduced to commodity. Bookshops and alternative stores became filled with "New Age" paraphernalia and self-help guru's. Western culture was looking for a replacement for organised religion, but what also came with this commercial business which extrapolated ideas from philosophy, religion and even transcendental drug cultures, was the deconstruction of ancient Eastern ideologies. Chinese and Indian religious traditions were ransacked and certain ideas were extracted for consumer consumption in book-of-the-week, escapist fad. It is no mistake that Hollywood cinema, along with the literary industries, collided with supernatural tales. The heavy emphasis on the search for a modern spirituality, along with a deep-seated religious guilt, lead to some of horror cinema's great narratives (The Exorcist (1973), The Omen (1976)), and Audrey Rose took similar root. Audrey Rose was adapted from screenwriter Frank De Fellita's own novel, and uses these cultural trends, along with the omnipresent use of an adolescent at the centre, and the concept of reincarnation as the basis for familial horror. The middle class New York Templeton family are approached by Elliot Hoover (Anthony Hopkins), who's wife and daughter had died in a car crash several years earlier. He then claims that their daughter, Ivy (Susan Swift), is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose. Ivy's night terrors increase in intensity, something that Hoover states is his daughter crying to get out off a burning car. As Hoover begins to get access to Ivy, even her mother Janice (Marsha Mason) begins to believe when he calms Ivy down by calling her Audrey. Hopkins' performance is terrifically balanced, portraying the character with both a sinister quality and the intensity of the grieving father, believing that he is in the presence of his daughters soul. However, the first half of the film is the better experience here, beginning with the mystery of Hoover, as he seems to stalk the family. The second half is a bit of a drag, falling into repetition and over-the-top pop-psychology. Directed by seasoned director Robert Wise, who had dealt with the supernatural in the excellent The Haunting (1963), it does have some interesting scenes, but as a whole it lacks the intensity required for the story. Due to the central theme of the alteration of the child, like so many films of the time, it fears youth autonomy, but with the inclusion of the trend, it does often create inferior visual imitation. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    In New York, Janice Templeton (Marsha Mason) is happily married with the executive Bill Templeton (John Beck) and they live in a comfortable and fancy apartment with their eleven year-old daughter Ivy (Susan Swift). One day, Janice is stalked by a weirdo and she tells her husband. Soon the stranger contacts them and invites the couple to meet him in a restaurant. Elliot Hoover (Anthony Hopkins) tells to Janice and Bill that his daughter Audrey Rose died eleven years ago burned in a car crash and her soul would have reincarnated in Ivy's body. Bill and Janice believe that Elliot is nuts and Bill tells his lawyer to get a restraining order against Elliot. However, Ivy has dreadful nightmares and only Elliot is capable to calm her down. When Elliot abducts Ivy, Bill and Janice go to the court to arrest him. But Elliot wants to prove that Ivy and Audrey Rose are the same soul. When I saw "Audrey Rose" in the 70's, I found it a great film of reincarnation. I have just seen it again on DVD and this time I found it a reasonable film only with a flawed screenplay. Maybe the film is dated, with the present behavior of people. The unstable Janice Templeton, performed by Marsha Mason, is an inconsistent and irritating character. Her attitudes are ridiculous and she never supports her husband, even in court when she is summoned to testify. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "As Duas Vidas de Audrey Rose" ("The Two Lives of Audrey Rose")

    I found this film extremely enjoyable as it was so original with concepts about reincarnation way ahead of its time (1977), and I really don't know how it could have been shortened or sped up as suggested by some as it seemed all the necessary information was relayed to us as it only could have been, step by step - otherwise, it would have been confusing. In short summary, a mysterious man seems to be stalking a seemingly happy family, until we begin to learn the family is not so happy, as the young daughter has frequent terrifying nightmares, and pretty soon the man watching her from afar, despite all prejudice from the father especially, becomes her saviour as he seems to comfort her during her traumatic episodes. There is even a court case later on - who would have thought of this in 1977, let alone today - concerning WHO the child really is! I won't say anymore.... I don't understand why this film has received such a low score here, even if the acting and directing are not top-notch, just the sheer originality makes up for whatever might be lacking. I believe we should cherish films like this that make an effort to step out of the ordinary, out of the mundane film world of car chases and bombs going off and inane conversations. This is a film that can make you think, if you let it - hey, maybe, this, or parts of this, are really true!

    While the overall plot of the movie was excellent, especially for that period of time when the subject of reincarnation was new, Susan Swift's acting "ability" made this movie unbearable to watch. Her constant whining and inability to control her facial features was a huge distraction not to mention that she looked as though she had a mental illness. I cannot believe that she was actually picked for a big screen movie, she lacks any form of talent and is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. I looked up her biography and it's no surprise that she only starred in a total of 4 big screen productions, someone finally realized the dud that they had on their hands. The old saying that money talks really must have rung true when her parents took her to that audition.

    Audrey Rose: An Underrated Supernatural Thriller

    Robert Wise may have directed "West Side Story" and "The Sound of Music." But he has done a fair share of horror films and thrillers, including "The Curse of the Cat People," "The Day The Earth Stood Still," but most notably, "The Haunting." However, hardly anybody seems to remember a 1977 film called "Audrey Rose." It is another film from the famed director that, in my eyes, is very memorable and atmospheric. Janice and Bill Templeton are leading a very happy marriage with their daughter, Ivy. The last thing they want is a strange man by the name of Elliot Hoover stalking them. Worst of all, he sets his eye on Ivy. Soon enough, they are able to talk to Hoover. He explains that his wife and daughter, Audrey Rose, died in a horrible car accident, and that his daughter may have crossed over into Ivy. Of course, Janice and Bill dismiss Hoover as a lunatic. But that's when Ivy begins to exhibit strange behavior. Could Hoover be correct? Is Ivy really the reincarnation of Audrey Rose? Now, when "Audrey Rose" first came out in 1977, it was subject to mixed reviews, mostly because it was seen as a horror film, and I can understand why. It was released a few years after "The Exorcist," when horror films were becoming more modern and faith was being challenged. But I don't see "Audrey Rose" as a horror film. Instead, I perceive it as a supernatural thriller with a touch of family drama. And it's a very good one. Based on the novel by Frank De Felitta, creator of "The Entity" and director of "Dark Night of the Scarecrow," "Audrey Rose" is a nifty thriller for three reasons. First, Robert Wise gives superb direction. He registers the exact amount of passion that he had for "The Haunting" and he has chosen an effective story that challenges the beliefs of the viewer. Do we choose to believe Hoover in that his daughter has come back in the form of Ivy? Or is Ivy simply an ill child in need of psychiatric help? It is a great story. Second, the acting is quite good. Anthony Hopkins and John Beck give very nice performances as Hoover and Bill. The wide-eyed newcomer Susan Swift is especially believable in the scenes in which Ivy shows off the nightmarish behavior of Hoover's dead daughter. But I, and many other people who have seen the movie, feel that the greatest performance belongs to Marsha Mason, star of "The Goodbye Girl," as Janice. Once Audrey Rose takes over Ivy, Janice's fear of losing her daughter shows and Mason's acting intensifies as the movie goes on. Third, the film has a tremendous atmosphere. The scenes of rain pattering on the windows as Ivy screams for her daddy are incredibly creepy, and so are the scenes at Ivy's school and inside the banal hospital. There are plenty of movies about possession and bad seeds, but a reincarnation thriller is very uncommon. "Audrey Rose" may be a little long, but it is a super-effective supernatural thriller that is very creepy. It will leave you with questions, and raise ideas about reincarnation. Robert Wise has given us a thriller to remember.

    Maybe I'm biased. When I was looking for something to spice up the Halloween mood Netflix recommended this movie to me. I enjoy paranormal horror films and was looking for the moody, psychological thrill that the 70's horror films seemed to have in spades. That was not delivered to me with this film. On it's own, Audrey Rose isn't a bad movie. Not great, but not bad. I don't know how I feel about Marsha Mason on a whole. I don't think she added the dramatic oomph that I was hoping for from her character, but she wasn't bad or a distraction, which is more than I can say for the little girl. I thought that the actress playing Ivy was awful the majority of the time, non-sympathetic and obnoxiously pouty. But the real issue with the film is that I felt cheated. I was promised a horror story and instead I got one of reincarnation. This film is really more of a courtroom drama if anything. Aside from my issue with how the film is presented, I also found myself annoyed that the filmed seemed to allude that those who believe in reincarnation are the only ones that believe in life after death and can therefore be comforted instead of bereft.
