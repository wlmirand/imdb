 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Set in 1999, a woman (Dommartin) has a car accident with some bank robbers, who enlist her help to take the bank money to a drop in Paris. On the way she runs into another fugitive from the law (Hurt), an American who is being chased by the CIA. The charges are false, he claims. They want to confiscate a device his father invented which allows anyone to record their dreams and vision. On the run from both the bank robbers and the CIA, the couple span the globe, ending up in Australia at his father's (von Sydow) research facility, where they hope to play back the recordings Hurt captured for his blind mother. Set in the futuristic year of 1999, a subplot about a damaged Indian nuclear satellite crashing and causing the end of civilization is a puzzling addition to the film.

    I first learned of this film after stumbling across its soundtrack. Upon learning that it's a piece of science fiction, I decided to give the film a try. Bad news first: the film is long. It runs for a good two-and-a-half hours, but incredibly, it's only the short version; the rough cut was originally eight hours long, and the director's preferred version is 280 minutes. Even at 150 minutes, this film feels long and it drags at times. That doesn't mean it's a total bore. The film is pretty evenly split in half (for the theatrical cut anyway; the director's cut is supposedly arranged as a three-part trilogy). The first half is easily the most interesting and thrilling, as it follows this woman all across Europe and Asia and everywhere else, investigating some shady people and mysterious devices and roaming around some strange post-modern futuristic settings. It comes off much like a sci-fi film noir, somewhat akin to Brazil, but nowhere near as goofy. In the film's last half, with a great catastrophe befalling the Earth, the characters wind up holing themselves up somewhere in Australia, where they bum around for the remainder of the picture. I found this part far less interesting, but it offers a few interesting ideas (including one key aspect that echoes Inception a lot). Altogether, I'd say that it's an interesting film with lots of interesting ideas and plot points, but it achieves the type of pacing that straddles the threshold of being fascinating and unfascinating. If anything in the above paragraph indicates anything, it's that the story itself is pretty sound and full of neat ideas. It's populated by interesting characters. I really don't have many complaints about the story, other than it felt like it trailed off in the end. This film looks neat, with quality photography and editing. Acting is swell: I did get a kick out of watching William Hurt, Sam Niell, and Solveig Dommartin in their roles (and Max Von Sydow makes an appearance toward the end). Writing is alright. This production does its best to use then-modern sets, props, and costumes for a futuristic look, but with mixed results. Frankly, parts of the film look cheap and cheesy, in a manner no different than Paul Verhoeven's films. Still, it gets the job done. Music is pretty cool. It's an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. It is a shame that this film was a commercial and critical failure on its release, because it's not that bad at all. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    Many say that the 4.5 hour version is much better than the 2.5 hour. I guess there were even eight-hour and twenty-hour versions. The 2.5 version hobbles along after the first hour. I can't imagine more than this. I didn't sense any great examination of the human condition. It was pretentious and self-serving. (I have a crappy job where the time crawls by and I'd gladly go there vs. another minute of this.) Closely following that was the illogic in many elements of the story. The bank robbers wanted the girl to carry the money to France. Why? The good guy steals SOME of the money? The bank robbers finally come back for their money. I GUESS they got it all. Very forgiving bank robbers. Basically my problem is that the money was stolen and stolen and stolen and there was plenty left over. And the film was way too forgiving of this girl. She runs all over the world to get her money back and for the love of this guy. I found it silly. And the bank robber gladly shows up in the 2nd hour to help this girl? I guess French bank robbers are pansies. The zapping of all the electrical devices was lifted directly from Escape from L.A. I was surprised how short-sighted the technology of it all was for being made in '91. Then they lost me when he met up with his parents. I didn't see the great psychological discussions that everyone else did. And why did he travel the world with that stupid camera? If the point was to see if the mother could see with this camera, then go outside for ten minutes and film a bush. Or the house cat. But NOOOO. We have to take two years to do that? After the ten minutes and it works, then put the camera in front of the Travel Channel. I'm sorry. My bad. Then there would be no movie and no room for bad overacting.

    I guess the question you have to ask yourself if considering taking on this film is, Do I want to spend almost 5 hours of my life on this? The conception of the film is ambitious and brilliant, it covers a huge amount of ground. It's visually stunning, and the choice of music and its melding with scenes and moods is inspired - especially Ray Davies' 'Thank You for the Days' whenever it appears. But does the film actually work? Unfortunately not. And the main reason for this, for a native English speaker, is that we have non-native speakers of English being directed by a non-native speaker of English. Although novelist Peter Carey had a hand in the writing, he obviously didn't help Wenders with the directing. So many of the lines are badly delivered, and much of the acting is wooden. Even actors of the stature of Jeanne Moreau and Max von Sydow can't deliver lines in English without good direction. Maybe it all sounded good to Wim, but sorry Wim, it doesn't work for Anglophones. Even William Hurt's and Sam Neill's lines often fall flat. If you speak German, try the German version - it sounded better to me. Otherwise, why not spend the time watching 'Wings of Desire' TWICE, or watch three of Wenders' great early films? They are much more rewarding.

    I'm not really a Wim Wenders fanboy. I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the "objectively good, yet too slowly paced" art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders. However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, "Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me." Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects: the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams. Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, "This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax?" Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from. I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, "Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him," give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though. I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams "Wim Wenders" to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

    This is my favourite film but it will not be to everyone's taste. The mix of whimsy and melancholy will puzzle some, who may ask how seriously they are meant to take it? Its length and occasional problems with continuity will put others off. Added to this, what is intended to be the central romantic relationship never quite convinces. But the film as a whole is redeemed by its sheer ambition and, most importantly, the humanity and the generosity of its vision. It's 1999 - that's seven years into the future - and the world is threatened by an orbiting satellite that carries a powerful nuclear device. Meanwhile, Henry Farber has stolen a camera of his own invention from the American government, not trusting the uses to which they might put it. He sends his son, Sam, around the world, collecting images with this device. These images are to be electronically projected into the brain of Henry's blind wife, Edith. On his travels, Sam picks up a stalker, Claire Tourneur, who is on the rebound from a broken relationship with the writer, Gene FitzPatrick. Sam collects images for his mother. Claire chases Sam. Gene chases Claire. The investigator, Philip Winter, who appeared in Wenders' previous film, 'Alice in the Cities,' chases all of them. Eventually, everyone ends up at Henry's lab in the Australian outback, the satellite having exploded and, with all communication cut off, no-one being sure whether the world is still alive. Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive. And there's more to it than that. Much more. As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD. Not to everyone's taste then, but those of us who like it, love it.

    At a whopping 280 minutes, Wender's intended length of his sci-fi epic Until the End of the World might actually make some wish the world was ending, but for those of us willing to commit the time, the Director's cut is a rewarding experience. The 150 minute theatrical version of the film was criticized for being overly ambitious, disjointed and underdeveloped, while the Director's cut not only fills in these blanks, it fleshes out this fascinating story about how we see the world around us, the search for identity within that world and our obsessive/destructive interface with technology as a means to process reality, both conscious and unconscious. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/

    Let me make this short and straight. Just avoid it, I mean it. I was somehow dragged into watching this and this was a real torture. How can you rate this as Sci-Fi. Even 50 years ago people could do much better effects. Don't tell me this is a style thing. If so, then call this as crap fiction, not science fiction. There was no story and the whole movie so boring. Even if you are forced to watch it, avoid the long version by all means for your own mental health. I don't troll movies but this one really deserves a good kick so that people that doesn't have the slightest clue about technology does not attempt to produce yet another garbage like this.

    1st: I have only watched the long(est) version of this movie once. 2nd: Wenders' "Wings of Desire" (Der Himmel &uuml;ber Berlin) is pretty much literally my favorite movie ever. 3rd: I have LOVED plenty of films that are any combination of long, abstract, meandering, foreign, low on action or even plot, with supposedly realistic, down to earth characters, etc. etc. etc. 4th: I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this "science fiction". Even more so to call it "cyberpunk". I just have trouble believing that just because you incorporate a few elements of sci-fi and film-noir detective genres in a near-future setting, it is just automatically cyberpunk. And even just to call it science fiction... the supposed overall premise that the world could end due to a nuclear satellite destabilizing is not actually particularly science fiction (nor even hardly realistically scientifically plausible) but it's pretty much completely ignored for the entire movie, so what does it matter. likewise, the "device" is little more than a generic "MacGuffin" for most of the film, and when they finally do get into it, it is with the shallowest, most cursory glossing over of any interesting exploration of the concepts, remaining little more than a MacGuffin still; a random crux for some ridiculous, muddled new-age psycho-babble philosophical wanking, which doesn't really go anywhere or last very long; just seems to be a random way of ending that part of the film. Anyway, if you really were interested in checking out some real sci-fi about topics such as these, you could so easily do SOOO much better, so don't get roped into watching this just because the sci-fi aspect sounds interesting. about the only interesting thing in that regard is that they somehow managed to predict modern automobile sat-nav units pretty much exactly!! So, all that out of the way, this movie is obviously VERY long. I am almost curious that a better edited version could be more interesting, but I don't really see how that's possible. It's the content, not the length, that failed to keep my interest. I did find it pretty interesting in the beginning, enjoyed the bit in Japan, and the Australia where most of the rest of the film took place seemed remarkably realistic and down to earth compared to typical depictions, so that was somewhat interesting. But in general it just wandered nowhere so aimlessly... I doubt it's true, but I really got the feel that they were just making this up as they went along past the initial setup, and really could not figure out where to take it without writing around in circles, into corners, through ridiculous plot-holes, trailing loose ends all along the way. Of course, this wouldn't be so bad considering Wenders' penchant for stunning, timeless cinematography, directing, pacing, and phenomenally real, alive, emotionally transparent acting... but shockingly none of that is in evidence here! about all this albatross has going for it is a few interesting characters, a few pretty good minor actors, and a rather cute, intriguing leading lady, but even that wasn't nearly enough to carry it past the first two hours. The use of various languages could have been interesting, but I just found it jarring and unnatural. While it seems that many of the actors were pretty gifted in at least one language, they end up speaking a lot in other languages, particularly English, in which their performance seemed severely curtailed. Absurdly enough, the well established American actors actually tend to give some of the most wooden, hokey, unbelievable deliveries in English on here! And i generally do like them in other films I've seen. It's all pretty inexplicable. I can't find myself believing most of what takes place in this film. Other reviews on IMDb have pointed out a few of the ridiculous plot holes and pointlessly unrealistic plot twists, and I'm not much inspired to suffer remembering it to point out more; there are PLENTY. But even when you ignore these technical blunders, the main dramatic story line just makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why does she suddenly fall in love with some random guy just because she runs into him on her little adventure, gives him a ride, and he steals some of her money? i certainly see no chemistry or connection whatsoever between them at that point; it's completely out of nowhere. And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag. I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out "Wings of Desire", and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini... Even if you like this film, believe me, you CAN do MUCH better, so keep looking!

    You know you are in trouble when the comments on the back of the DVD packaging say "visually stunning", because this is the inevitable comment on a film which has a rambling disjointed plot and below par acting. And so it was. Way, way too long at almost 3 hours the story is played out across the world. The characters are flat and unengaging - the two male leads being played by Sam Neil and William Hurt who specialise in alienation and distance. Neil's facial expression is the same whether he is in love, being betrayed, chasing the bad guy, being mugged, or watching his beloved in agony. Even the most emotionally charged part of the film - in the father-son relationship during the last third - is clich&eacute;d (with Max von Sydow playing to type) and stilted. The plot twists and turns, but in the end leaves many things unexplained - it's not at all clear why Hurt is being pursued in the end or who the people were that pursued him. It all gets resolved by the supposed disaster which never materialises - a disaster movie with no disaster, an apocalypse with no horsemen. It's full of disjointed parts that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Many of the scenes are completely flat and add nothing. When Hurt wakes up between two elders, they seem to be as baffled by their appearance in the movie as I was, and he is as unreadable as ever. The idea of hiding away in Australia with a tribe of Aboriginals is somewhat novel, but this is a white man's fantasy I think - they are a group of Man Friday's who attend to his every need, although there is a step too far and they do leave him which once again is done with minimal emotion. The whole thing was as dry as the Aussie desert. Maybe you had to see it on the big screen, but in the end I did not believe the film was visual stunning - it used some stock shots of the Australian Outback but there was nothing very interesting in the way the film was shot. I found myself earnestly wishing for the end of the movie, if not the world.

    I find this film to be beyond description - in some ways it is dated - the car map system looked cool when nobody had GPS. It reflects the visions of the cyberpunk literature and cultural movements of the late '80s and early '90s, which has some relevance, but has morphed beyond recognition. In actual 1999, I found a great prophetic irony in the opening lines: "1999 was the year the Indian Nuclear Satellite went out of control. No one knew where it might land. It soared above the ozone layer like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed..." I rewrote them to reflect the actual reality: 1999 was the year the dot com and Y2K bug hype went out of control. No one knew where it might end. It soared above our corporate servers and venture-capital-burn-rate like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed... So there are some decently interesting science fiction aspects to this movie, but I would say that this is actually the ultimate art film as road movie. Just see "Wings Of Desire" if you don't think Wenders is an art film director. Of course I have to give it extra points just for spending extra time in one of my favorite world-class bars - the Tosca. Even though this is a cyberpunk sci-fi film, and an art film and a road film, it manages ultimately to be introspectively psychological (as do all Wenders films that I have seen so far). I cannot watch this movie without shedding at least a tear for the beautiful and talented Solveig Dommarten, whose career and life were cut far too short. I see other reviews talking about the lack of story. This movie is better watched as painting - the title or theme may be short, but it unfolds in the tasting of the experience of the images, some of which were pretty striking in 1991. I thought the theatrical release was pretty good at the time, but if you can, slow down and watch the 5 hour trilogy version (a third at a time).

    Many say that the 4.5 hour version is much better than the 2.5 hour. I guess there were even eight-hour and twenty-hour versions. The 2.5 version hobbles along after the first hour. I can't imagine more than this. I didn't sense any great examination of the human condition. It was pretentious and self-serving. (I have a crappy job where the time crawls by and I'd gladly go there vs. another minute of this.) Closely following that was the illogic in many elements of the story. The bank robbers wanted the girl to carry the money to France. Why? The good guy steals SOME of the money? The bank robbers finally come back for their money. I GUESS they got it all. Very forgiving bank robbers. Basically my problem is that the money was stolen and stolen and stolen and there was plenty left over. And the film was way too forgiving of this girl. She runs all over the world to get her money back and for the love of this guy. I found it silly. And the bank robber gladly shows up in the 2nd hour to help this girl? I guess French bank robbers are pansies. The zapping of all the electrical devices was lifted directly from Escape from L.A. I was surprised how short-sighted the technology of it all was for being made in '91. Then they lost me when he met up with his parents. I didn't see the great psychological discussions that everyone else did. And why did he travel the world with that stupid camera? If the point was to see if the mother could see with this camera, then go outside for ten minutes and film a bush. Or the house cat. But NOOOO. We have to take two years to do that? After the ten minutes and it works, then put the camera in front of the Travel Channel. I'm sorry. My bad. Then there would be no movie and no room for bad overacting.

    I guess the question you have to ask yourself if considering taking on this film is, Do I want to spend almost 5 hours of my life on this? The conception of the film is ambitious and brilliant, it covers a huge amount of ground. It's visually stunning, and the choice of music and its melding with scenes and moods is inspired - especially Ray Davies' 'Thank You for the Days' whenever it appears. But does the film actually work? Unfortunately not. And the main reason for this, for a native English speaker, is that we have non-native speakers of English being directed by a non-native speaker of English. Although novelist Peter Carey had a hand in the writing, he obviously didn't help Wenders with the directing. So many of the lines are badly delivered, and much of the acting is wooden. Even actors of the stature of Jeanne Moreau and Max von Sydow can't deliver lines in English without good direction. Maybe it all sounded good to Wim, but sorry Wim, it doesn't work for Anglophones. Even William Hurt's and Sam Neill's lines often fall flat. If you speak German, try the German version - it sounded better to me. Otherwise, why not spend the time watching 'Wings of Desire' TWICE, or watch three of Wenders' great early films? They are much more rewarding.

    I'm not really a Wim Wenders fanboy. I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the "objectively good, yet too slowly paced" art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders. However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, "Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me." Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects: the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams. Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, "This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax?" Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from. I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, "Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him," give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though. I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams "Wim Wenders" to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

    A Film about a Camera that Takes Pictures that Blind People Can See

    This is my favourite film but it will not be to everyone's taste. The mix of whimsy and melancholy will puzzle some, who may ask how seriously they are meant to take it? Its length and occasional problems with continuity will put others off. Added to this, what is intended to be the central romantic relationship never quite convinces. But the film as a whole is redeemed by its sheer ambition and, most importantly, the humanity and the generosity of its vision. It's 1999 - that's seven years into the future - and the world is threatened by an orbiting satellite that carries a powerful nuclear device. Meanwhile, Henry Farber has stolen a camera of his own invention from the American government, not trusting the uses to which they might put it. He sends his son, Sam, around the world, collecting images with this device. These images are to be electronically projected into the brain of Henry's blind wife, Edith. On his travels, Sam picks up a stalker, Claire Tourneur, who is on the rebound from a broken relationship with the writer, Gene FitzPatrick. Sam collects images for his mother. Claire chases Sam. Gene chases Claire. The investigator, Philip Winter, who appeared in Wenders' previous film, 'Alice in the Cities,' chases all of them. Eventually, everyone ends up at Henry's lab in the Australian outback, the satellite having exploded and, with all communication cut off, no-one being sure whether the world is still alive. Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive. And there's more to it than that. Much more. As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD. Not to everyone's taste then, but those of us who like it, love it.

    At a whopping 280 minutes, Wender's intended length of his sci-fi epic Until the End of the World might actually make some wish the world was ending, but for those of us willing to commit the time, the Director's cut is a rewarding experience. The 150 minute theatrical version of the film was criticized for being overly ambitious, disjointed and underdeveloped, while the Director's cut not only fills in these blanks, it fleshes out this fascinating story about how we see the world around us, the search for identity within that world and our obsessive/destructive interface with technology as a means to process reality, both conscious and unconscious. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/

    Let me make this short and straight. Just avoid it, I mean it. I was somehow dragged into watching this and this was a real torture. How can you rate this as Sci-Fi. Even 50 years ago people could do much better effects. Don't tell me this is a style thing. If so, then call this as crap fiction, not science fiction. There was no story and the whole movie so boring. Even if you are forced to watch it, avoid the long version by all means for your own mental health. I don't troll movies but this one really deserves a good kick so that people that doesn't have the slightest clue about technology does not attempt to produce yet another garbage like this.

    1st: I have only watched the long(est) version of this movie once. 2nd: Wenders' "Wings of Desire" (Der Himmel &uuml;ber Berlin) is pretty much literally my favorite movie ever. 3rd: I have LOVED plenty of films that are any combination of long, abstract, meandering, foreign, low on action or even plot, with supposedly realistic, down to earth characters, etc. etc. etc. 4th: I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this "science fiction". Even more so to call it "cyberpunk". I just have trouble believing that just because you incorporate a few elements of sci-fi and film-noir detective genres in a near-future setting, it is just automatically cyberpunk. And even just to call it science fiction... the supposed overall premise that the world could end due to a nuclear satellite destabilizing is not actually particularly science fiction (nor even hardly realistically scientifically plausible) but it's pretty much completely ignored for the entire movie, so what does it matter. likewise, the "device" is little more than a generic "MacGuffin" for most of the film, and when they finally do get into it, it is with the shallowest, most cursory glossing over of any interesting exploration of the concepts, remaining little more than a MacGuffin still; a random crux for some ridiculous, muddled new-age psycho-babble philosophical wanking, which doesn't really go anywhere or last very long; just seems to be a random way of ending that part of the film. Anyway, if you really were interested in checking out some real sci-fi about topics such as these, you could so easily do SOOO much better, so don't get roped into watching this just because the sci-fi aspect sounds interesting. about the only interesting thing in that regard is that they somehow managed to predict modern automobile sat-nav units pretty much exactly!! So, all that out of the way, this movie is obviously VERY long. I am almost curious that a better edited version could be more interesting, but I don't really see how that's possible. It's the content, not the length, that failed to keep my interest. I did find it pretty interesting in the beginning, enjoyed the bit in Japan, and the Australia where most of the rest of the film took place seemed remarkably realistic and down to earth compared to typical depictions, so that was somewhat interesting. But in general it just wandered nowhere so aimlessly... I doubt it's true, but I really got the feel that they were just making this up as they went along past the initial setup, and really could not figure out where to take it without writing around in circles, into corners, through ridiculous plot-holes, trailing loose ends all along the way. Of course, this wouldn't be so bad considering Wenders' penchant for stunning, timeless cinematography, directing, pacing, and phenomenally real, alive, emotionally transparent acting... but shockingly none of that is in evidence here! about all this albatross has going for it is a few interesting characters, a few pretty good minor actors, and a rather cute, intriguing leading lady, but even that wasn't nearly enough to carry it past the first two hours. The use of various languages could have been interesting, but I just found it jarring and unnatural. While it seems that many of the actors were pretty gifted in at least one language, they end up speaking a lot in other languages, particularly English, in which their performance seemed severely curtailed. Absurdly enough, the well established American actors actually tend to give some of the most wooden, hokey, unbelievable deliveries in English on here! And i generally do like them in other films I've seen. It's all pretty inexplicable. I can't find myself believing most of what takes place in this film. Other reviews on IMDb have pointed out a few of the ridiculous plot holes and pointlessly unrealistic plot twists, and I'm not much inspired to suffer remembering it to point out more; there are PLENTY. But even when you ignore these technical blunders, the main dramatic story line just makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why does she suddenly fall in love with some random guy just because she runs into him on her little adventure, gives him a ride, and he steals some of her money? i certainly see no chemistry or connection whatsoever between them at that point; it's completely out of nowhere. And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag. I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out "Wings of Desire", and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini... Even if you like this film, believe me, you CAN do MUCH better, so keep looking!

    You know you are in trouble when the comments on the back of the DVD packaging say "visually stunning", because this is the inevitable comment on a film which has a rambling disjointed plot and below par acting. And so it was. Way, way too long at almost 3 hours the story is played out across the world. The characters are flat and unengaging - the two male leads being played by Sam Neil and William Hurt who specialise in alienation and distance. Neil's facial expression is the same whether he is in love, being betrayed, chasing the bad guy, being mugged, or watching his beloved in agony. Even the most emotionally charged part of the film - in the father-son relationship during the last third - is clich&eacute;d (with Max von Sydow playing to type) and stilted. The plot twists and turns, but in the end leaves many things unexplained - it's not at all clear why Hurt is being pursued in the end or who the people were that pursued him. It all gets resolved by the supposed disaster which never materialises - a disaster movie with no disaster, an apocalypse with no horsemen. It's full of disjointed parts that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Many of the scenes are completely flat and add nothing. When Hurt wakes up between two elders, they seem to be as baffled by their appearance in the movie as I was, and he is as unreadable as ever. The idea of hiding away in Australia with a tribe of Aboriginals is somewhat novel, but this is a white man's fantasy I think - they are a group of Man Friday's who attend to his every need, although there is a step too far and they do leave him which once again is done with minimal emotion. The whole thing was as dry as the Aussie desert. Maybe you had to see it on the big screen, but in the end I did not believe the film was visual stunning - it used some stock shots of the Australian Outback but there was nothing very interesting in the way the film was shot. I found myself earnestly wishing for the end of the movie, if not the world.

    I find this film to be beyond description - in some ways it is dated - the car map system looked cool when nobody had GPS. It reflects the visions of the cyberpunk literature and cultural movements of the late '80s and early '90s, which has some relevance, but has morphed beyond recognition. In actual 1999, I found a great prophetic irony in the opening lines: "1999 was the year the Indian Nuclear Satellite went out of control. No one knew where it might land. It soared above the ozone layer like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed..." I rewrote them to reflect the actual reality: 1999 was the year the dot com and Y2K bug hype went out of control. No one knew where it might end. It soared above our corporate servers and venture-capital-burn-rate like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed... So there are some decently interesting science fiction aspects to this movie, but I would say that this is actually the ultimate art film as road movie. Just see "Wings Of Desire" if you don't think Wenders is an art film director. Of course I have to give it extra points just for spending extra time in one of my favorite world-class bars - the Tosca. Even though this is a cyberpunk sci-fi film, and an art film and a road film, it manages ultimately to be introspectively psychological (as do all Wenders films that I have seen so far). I cannot watch this movie without shedding at least a tear for the beautiful and talented Solveig Dommarten, whose career and life were cut far too short. I see other reviews talking about the lack of story. This movie is better watched as painting - the title or theme may be short, but it unfolds in the tasting of the experience of the images, some of which were pretty striking in 1991. I thought the theatrical release was pretty good at the time, but if you can, slow down and watch the 5 hour trilogy version (a third at a time).

    I first learned of this film after stumbling across its soundtrack. Upon learning that it's a piece of science fiction, I decided to give the film a try. Bad news first: the film is long. It runs for a good two-and-a-half hours, but incredibly, it's only the short version; the rough cut was originally eight hours long, and the director's preferred version is 280 minutes. Even at 150 minutes, this film feels long and it drags at times. That doesn't mean it's a total bore. The film is pretty evenly split in half (for the theatrical cut anyway; the director's cut is supposedly arranged as a three-part trilogy). The first half is easily the most interesting and thrilling, as it follows this woman all across Europe and Asia and everywhere else, investigating some shady people and mysterious devices and roaming around some strange post-modern futuristic settings. It comes off much like a sci-fi film noir, somewhat akin to Brazil, but nowhere near as goofy. In the film's last half, with a great catastrophe befalling the Earth, the characters wind up holing themselves up somewhere in Australia, where they bum around for the remainder of the picture. I found this part far less interesting, but it offers a few interesting ideas (including one key aspect that echoes Inception a lot). Altogether, I'd say that it's an interesting film with lots of interesting ideas and plot points, but it achieves the type of pacing that straddles the threshold of being fascinating and unfascinating. If anything in the above paragraph indicates anything, it's that the story itself is pretty sound and full of neat ideas. It's populated by interesting characters. I really don't have many complaints about the story, other than it felt like it trailed off in the end. This film looks neat, with quality photography and editing. Acting is swell: I did get a kick out of watching William Hurt, Sam Niell, and Solveig Dommartin in their roles (and Max Von Sydow makes an appearance toward the end). Writing is alright. This production does its best to use then-modern sets, props, and costumes for a futuristic look, but with mixed results. Frankly, parts of the film look cheap and cheesy, in a manner no different than Paul Verhoeven's films. Still, it gets the job done. Music is pretty cool. It's an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. It is a shame that this film was a commercial and critical failure on its release, because it's not that bad at all. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from. I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, "Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him," give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though. I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams "Wim Wenders" to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

    A Film about a Camera that Takes Pictures that Blind People Can See

    This is my favourite film but it will not be to everyone's taste. The mix of whimsy and melancholy will puzzle some, who may ask how seriously they are meant to take it? Its length and occasional problems with continuity will put others off. Added to this, what is intended to be the central romantic relationship never quite convinces. But the film as a whole is redeemed by its sheer ambition and, most importantly, the humanity and the generosity of its vision. It's 1999 - that's seven years into the future - and the world is threatened by an orbiting satellite that carries a powerful nuclear device. Meanwhile, Henry Farber has stolen a camera of his own invention from the American government, not trusting the uses to which they might put it. He sends his son, Sam, around the world, collecting images with this device. These images are to be electronically projected into the brain of Henry's blind wife, Edith. On his travels, Sam picks up a stalker, Claire Tourneur, who is on the rebound from a broken relationship with the writer, Gene FitzPatrick. Sam collects images for his mother. Claire chases Sam. Gene chases Claire. The investigator, Philip Winter, who appeared in Wenders' previous film, 'Alice in the Cities,' chases all of them. Eventually, everyone ends up at Henry's lab in the Australian outback, the satellite having exploded and, with all communication cut off, no-one being sure whether the world is still alive. Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive. And there's more to it than that. Much more. As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD. Not to everyone's taste then, but those of us who like it, love it.

    At a whopping 280 minutes, Wender's intended length of his sci-fi epic Until the End of the World might actually make some wish the world was ending, but for those of us willing to commit the time, the Director's cut is a rewarding experience. The 150 minute theatrical version of the film was criticized for being overly ambitious, disjointed and underdeveloped, while the Director's cut not only fills in these blanks, it fleshes out this fascinating story about how we see the world around us, the search for identity within that world and our obsessive/destructive interface with technology as a means to process reality, both conscious and unconscious. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/

    Let me make this short and straight. Just avoid it, I mean it. I was somehow dragged into watching this and this was a real torture. How can you rate this as Sci-Fi. Even 50 years ago people could do much better effects. Don't tell me this is a style thing. If so, then call this as crap fiction, not science fiction. There was no story and the whole movie so boring. Even if you are forced to watch it, avoid the long version by all means for your own mental health. I don't troll movies but this one really deserves a good kick so that people that doesn't have the slightest clue about technology does not attempt to produce yet another garbage like this.

    1st: I have only watched the long(est) version of this movie once. 2nd: Wenders' "Wings of Desire" (Der Himmel &uuml;ber Berlin) is pretty much literally my favorite movie ever. 3rd: I have LOVED plenty of films that are any combination of long, abstract, meandering, foreign, low on action or even plot, with supposedly realistic, down to earth characters, etc. etc. etc. 4th: I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this "science fiction". Even more so to call it "cyberpunk". I just have trouble believing that just because you incorporate a few elements of sci-fi and film-noir detective genres in a near-future setting, it is just automatically cyberpunk. And even just to call it science fiction... the supposed overall premise that the world could end due to a nuclear satellite destabilizing is not actually particularly science fiction (nor even hardly realistically scientifically plausible) but it's pretty much completely ignored for the entire movie, so what does it matter. likewise, the "device" is little more than a generic "MacGuffin" for most of the film, and when they finally do get into it, it is with the shallowest, most cursory glossing over of any interesting exploration of the concepts, remaining little more than a MacGuffin still; a random crux for some ridiculous, muddled new-age psycho-babble philosophical wanking, which doesn't really go anywhere or last very long; just seems to be a random way of ending that part of the film. Anyway, if you really were interested in checking out some real sci-fi about topics such as these, you could so easily do SOOO much better, so don't get roped into watching this just because the sci-fi aspect sounds interesting. about the only interesting thing in that regard is that they somehow managed to predict modern automobile sat-nav units pretty much exactly!! So, all that out of the way, this movie is obviously VERY long. I am almost curious that a better edited version could be more interesting, but I don't really see how that's possible. It's the content, not the length, that failed to keep my interest. I did find it pretty interesting in the beginning, enjoyed the bit in Japan, and the Australia where most of the rest of the film took place seemed remarkably realistic and down to earth compared to typical depictions, so that was somewhat interesting. But in general it just wandered nowhere so aimlessly... I doubt it's true, but I really got the feel that they were just making this up as they went along past the initial setup, and really could not figure out where to take it without writing around in circles, into corners, through ridiculous plot-holes, trailing loose ends all along the way. Of course, this wouldn't be so bad considering Wenders' penchant for stunning, timeless cinematography, directing, pacing, and phenomenally real, alive, emotionally transparent acting... but shockingly none of that is in evidence here! about all this albatross has going for it is a few interesting characters, a few pretty good minor actors, and a rather cute, intriguing leading lady, but even that wasn't nearly enough to carry it past the first two hours. The use of various languages could have been interesting, but I just found it jarring and unnatural. While it seems that many of the actors were pretty gifted in at least one language, they end up speaking a lot in other languages, particularly English, in which their performance seemed severely curtailed. Absurdly enough, the well established American actors actually tend to give some of the most wooden, hokey, unbelievable deliveries in English on here! And i generally do like them in other films I've seen. It's all pretty inexplicable. I can't find myself believing most of what takes place in this film. Other reviews on IMDb have pointed out a few of the ridiculous plot holes and pointlessly unrealistic plot twists, and I'm not much inspired to suffer remembering it to point out more; there are PLENTY. But even when you ignore these technical blunders, the main dramatic story line just makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why does she suddenly fall in love with some random guy just because she runs into him on her little adventure, gives him a ride, and he steals some of her money? i certainly see no chemistry or connection whatsoever between them at that point; it's completely out of nowhere. And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag. I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out "Wings of Desire", and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini... Even if you like this film, believe me, you CAN do MUCH better, so keep looking!

    You know you are in trouble when the comments on the back of the DVD packaging say "visually stunning", because this is the inevitable comment on a film which has a rambling disjointed plot and below par acting. And so it was. Way, way too long at almost 3 hours the story is played out across the world. The characters are flat and unengaging - the two male leads being played by Sam Neil and William Hurt who specialise in alienation and distance. Neil's facial expression is the same whether he is in love, being betrayed, chasing the bad guy, being mugged, or watching his beloved in agony. Even the most emotionally charged part of the film - in the father-son relationship during the last third - is clich&eacute;d (with Max von Sydow playing to type) and stilted. The plot twists and turns, but in the end leaves many things unexplained - it's not at all clear why Hurt is being pursued in the end or who the people were that pursued him. It all gets resolved by the supposed disaster which never materialises - a disaster movie with no disaster, an apocalypse with no horsemen. It's full of disjointed parts that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Many of the scenes are completely flat and add nothing. When Hurt wakes up between two elders, they seem to be as baffled by their appearance in the movie as I was, and he is as unreadable as ever. The idea of hiding away in Australia with a tribe of Aboriginals is somewhat novel, but this is a white man's fantasy I think - they are a group of Man Friday's who attend to his every need, although there is a step too far and they do leave him which once again is done with minimal emotion. The whole thing was as dry as the Aussie desert. Maybe you had to see it on the big screen, but in the end I did not believe the film was visual stunning - it used some stock shots of the Australian Outback but there was nothing very interesting in the way the film was shot. I found myself earnestly wishing for the end of the movie, if not the world.

    I find this film to be beyond description - in some ways it is dated - the car map system looked cool when nobody had GPS. It reflects the visions of the cyberpunk literature and cultural movements of the late '80s and early '90s, which has some relevance, but has morphed beyond recognition. In actual 1999, I found a great prophetic irony in the opening lines: "1999 was the year the Indian Nuclear Satellite went out of control. No one knew where it might land. It soared above the ozone layer like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed..." I rewrote them to reflect the actual reality: 1999 was the year the dot com and Y2K bug hype went out of control. No one knew where it might end. It soared above our corporate servers and venture-capital-burn-rate like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed... So there are some decently interesting science fiction aspects to this movie, but I would say that this is actually the ultimate art film as road movie. Just see "Wings Of Desire" if you don't think Wenders is an art film director. Of course I have to give it extra points just for spending extra time in one of my favorite world-class bars - the Tosca. Even though this is a cyberpunk sci-fi film, and an art film and a road film, it manages ultimately to be introspectively psychological (as do all Wenders films that I have seen so far). I cannot watch this movie without shedding at least a tear for the beautiful and talented Solveig Dommarten, whose career and life were cut far too short. I see other reviews talking about the lack of story. This movie is better watched as painting - the title or theme may be short, but it unfolds in the tasting of the experience of the images, some of which were pretty striking in 1991. I thought the theatrical release was pretty good at the time, but if you can, slow down and watch the 5 hour trilogy version (a third at a time).

    I first learned of this film after stumbling across its soundtrack. Upon learning that it's a piece of science fiction, I decided to give the film a try. Bad news first: the film is long. It runs for a good two-and-a-half hours, but incredibly, it's only the short version; the rough cut was originally eight hours long, and the director's preferred version is 280 minutes. Even at 150 minutes, this film feels long and it drags at times. That doesn't mean it's a total bore. The film is pretty evenly split in half (for the theatrical cut anyway; the director's cut is supposedly arranged as a three-part trilogy). The first half is easily the most interesting and thrilling, as it follows this woman all across Europe and Asia and everywhere else, investigating some shady people and mysterious devices and roaming around some strange post-modern futuristic settings. It comes off much like a sci-fi film noir, somewhat akin to Brazil, but nowhere near as goofy. In the film's last half, with a great catastrophe befalling the Earth, the characters wind up holing themselves up somewhere in Australia, where they bum around for the remainder of the picture. I found this part far less interesting, but it offers a few interesting ideas (including one key aspect that echoes Inception a lot). Altogether, I'd say that it's an interesting film with lots of interesting ideas and plot points, but it achieves the type of pacing that straddles the threshold of being fascinating and unfascinating. If anything in the above paragraph indicates anything, it's that the story itself is pretty sound and full of neat ideas. It's populated by interesting characters. I really don't have many complaints about the story, other than it felt like it trailed off in the end. This film looks neat, with quality photography and editing. Acting is swell: I did get a kick out of watching William Hurt, Sam Niell, and Solveig Dommartin in their roles (and Max Von Sydow makes an appearance toward the end). Writing is alright. This production does its best to use then-modern sets, props, and costumes for a futuristic look, but with mixed results. Frankly, parts of the film look cheap and cheesy, in a manner no different than Paul Verhoeven's films. Still, it gets the job done. Music is pretty cool. It's an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. It is a shame that this film was a commercial and critical failure on its release, because it's not that bad at all. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    Many say that the 4.5 hour version is much better than the 2.5 hour. I guess there were even eight-hour and twenty-hour versions. The 2.5 version hobbles along after the first hour. I can't imagine more than this. I didn't sense any great examination of the human condition. It was pretentious and self-serving. (I have a crappy job where the time crawls by and I'd gladly go there vs. another minute of this.) Closely following that was the illogic in many elements of the story. The bank robbers wanted the girl to carry the money to France. Why? The good guy steals SOME of the money? The bank robbers finally come back for their money. I GUESS they got it all. Very forgiving bank robbers. Basically my problem is that the money was stolen and stolen and stolen and there was plenty left over. And the film was way too forgiving of this girl. She runs all over the world to get her money back and for the love of this guy. I found it silly. And the bank robber gladly shows up in the 2nd hour to help this girl? I guess French bank robbers are pansies. The zapping of all the electrical devices was lifted directly from Escape from L.A. I was surprised how short-sighted the technology of it all was for being made in '91. Then they lost me when he met up with his parents. I didn't see the great psychological discussions that everyone else did. And why did he travel the world with that stupid camera? If the point was to see if the mother could see with this camera, then go outside for ten minutes and film a bush. Or the house cat. But NOOOO. We have to take two years to do that? After the ten minutes and it works, then put the camera in front of the Travel Channel. I'm sorry. My bad. Then there would be no movie and no room for bad overacting.

    I guess the question you have to ask yourself if considering taking on this film is, Do I want to spend almost 5 hours of my life on this? The conception of the film is ambitious and brilliant, it covers a huge amount of ground. It's visually stunning, and the choice of music and its melding with scenes and moods is inspired - especially Ray Davies' 'Thank You for the Days' whenever it appears. But does the film actually work? Unfortunately not. And the main reason for this, for a native English speaker, is that we have non-native speakers of English being directed by a non-native speaker of English. Although novelist Peter Carey had a hand in the writing, he obviously didn't help Wenders with the directing. So many of the lines are badly delivered, and much of the acting is wooden. Even actors of the stature of Jeanne Moreau and Max von Sydow can't deliver lines in English without good direction. Maybe it all sounded good to Wim, but sorry Wim, it doesn't work for Anglophones. Even William Hurt's and Sam Neill's lines often fall flat. If you speak German, try the German version - it sounded better to me. Otherwise, why not spend the time watching 'Wings of Desire' TWICE, or watch three of Wenders' great early films? They are much more rewarding.

    I'm not really a Wim Wenders fanboy. I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the "objectively good, yet too slowly paced" art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders. However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, "Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me." Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects: the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams. Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, "This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax?" Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from. I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, "Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him," give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though. I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams "Wim Wenders" to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive. And there's more to it than that. Much more. As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD. Not to everyone's taste then, but those of us who like it, love it.

    At a whopping 280 minutes, Wender's intended length of his sci-fi epic Until the End of the World might actually make some wish the world was ending, but for those of us willing to commit the time, the Director's cut is a rewarding experience. The 150 minute theatrical version of the film was criticized for being overly ambitious, disjointed and underdeveloped, while the Director's cut not only fills in these blanks, it fleshes out this fascinating story about how we see the world around us, the search for identity within that world and our obsessive/destructive interface with technology as a means to process reality, both conscious and unconscious. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/

    Let me make this short and straight. Just avoid it, I mean it. I was somehow dragged into watching this and this was a real torture. How can you rate this as Sci-Fi. Even 50 years ago people could do much better effects. Don't tell me this is a style thing. If so, then call this as crap fiction, not science fiction. There was no story and the whole movie so boring. Even if you are forced to watch it, avoid the long version by all means for your own mental health. I don't troll movies but this one really deserves a good kick so that people that doesn't have the slightest clue about technology does not attempt to produce yet another garbage like this.

    1st: I have only watched the long(est) version of this movie once. 2nd: Wenders' "Wings of Desire" (Der Himmel &uuml;ber Berlin) is pretty much literally my favorite movie ever. 3rd: I have LOVED plenty of films that are any combination of long, abstract, meandering, foreign, low on action or even plot, with supposedly realistic, down to earth characters, etc. etc. etc. 4th: I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this "science fiction". Even more so to call it "cyberpunk". I just have trouble believing that just because you incorporate a few elements of sci-fi and film-noir detective genres in a near-future setting, it is just automatically cyberpunk. And even just to call it science fiction... the supposed overall premise that the world could end due to a nuclear satellite destabilizing is not actually particularly science fiction (nor even hardly realistically scientifically plausible) but it's pretty much completely ignored for the entire movie, so what does it matter. likewise, the "device" is little more than a generic "MacGuffin" for most of the film, and when they finally do get into it, it is with the shallowest, most cursory glossing over of any interesting exploration of the concepts, remaining little more than a MacGuffin still; a random crux for some ridiculous, muddled new-age psycho-babble philosophical wanking, which doesn't really go anywhere or last very long; just seems to be a random way of ending that part of the film. Anyway, if you really were interested in checking out some real sci-fi about topics such as these, you could so easily do SOOO much better, so don't get roped into watching this just because the sci-fi aspect sounds interesting. about the only interesting thing in that regard is that they somehow managed to predict modern automobile sat-nav units pretty much exactly!! So, all that out of the way, this movie is obviously VERY long. I am almost curious that a better edited version could be more interesting, but I don't really see how that's possible. It's the content, not the length, that failed to keep my interest. I did find it pretty interesting in the beginning, enjoyed the bit in Japan, and the Australia where most of the rest of the film took place seemed remarkably realistic and down to earth compared to typical depictions, so that was somewhat interesting. But in general it just wandered nowhere so aimlessly... I doubt it's true, but I really got the feel that they were just making this up as they went along past the initial setup, and really could not figure out where to take it without writing around in circles, into corners, through ridiculous plot-holes, trailing loose ends all along the way. Of course, this wouldn't be so bad considering Wenders' penchant for stunning, timeless cinematography, directing, pacing, and phenomenally real, alive, emotionally transparent acting... but shockingly none of that is in evidence here! about all this albatross has going for it is a few interesting characters, a few pretty good minor actors, and a rather cute, intriguing leading lady, but even that wasn't nearly enough to carry it past the first two hours. The use of various languages could have been interesting, but I just found it jarring and unnatural. While it seems that many of the actors were pretty gifted in at least one language, they end up speaking a lot in other languages, particularly English, in which their performance seemed severely curtailed. Absurdly enough, the well established American actors actually tend to give some of the most wooden, hokey, unbelievable deliveries in English on here! And i generally do like them in other films I've seen. It's all pretty inexplicable. I can't find myself believing most of what takes place in this film. Other reviews on IMDb have pointed out a few of the ridiculous plot holes and pointlessly unrealistic plot twists, and I'm not much inspired to suffer remembering it to point out more; there are PLENTY. But even when you ignore these technical blunders, the main dramatic story line just makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why does she suddenly fall in love with some random guy just because she runs into him on her little adventure, gives him a ride, and he steals some of her money? i certainly see no chemistry or connection whatsoever between them at that point; it's completely out of nowhere. And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag. I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out "Wings of Desire", and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini... Even if you like this film, believe me, you CAN do MUCH better, so keep looking!

    You know you are in trouble when the comments on the back of the DVD packaging say "visually stunning", because this is the inevitable comment on a film which has a rambling disjointed plot and below par acting. And so it was. Way, way too long at almost 3 hours the story is played out across the world. The characters are flat and unengaging - the two male leads being played by Sam Neil and William Hurt who specialise in alienation and distance. Neil's facial expression is the same whether he is in love, being betrayed, chasing the bad guy, being mugged, or watching his beloved in agony. Even the most emotionally charged part of the film - in the father-son relationship during the last third - is clich&eacute;d (with Max von Sydow playing to type) and stilted. The plot twists and turns, but in the end leaves many things unexplained - it's not at all clear why Hurt is being pursued in the end or who the people were that pursued him. It all gets resolved by the supposed disaster which never materialises - a disaster movie with no disaster, an apocalypse with no horsemen. It's full of disjointed parts that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Many of the scenes are completely flat and add nothing. When Hurt wakes up between two elders, they seem to be as baffled by their appearance in the movie as I was, and he is as unreadable as ever. The idea of hiding away in Australia with a tribe of Aboriginals is somewhat novel, but this is a white man's fantasy I think - they are a group of Man Friday's who attend to his every need, although there is a step too far and they do leave him which once again is done with minimal emotion. The whole thing was as dry as the Aussie desert. Maybe you had to see it on the big screen, but in the end I did not believe the film was visual stunning - it used some stock shots of the Australian Outback but there was nothing very interesting in the way the film was shot. I found myself earnestly wishing for the end of the movie, if not the world.

    I find this film to be beyond description - in some ways it is dated - the car map system looked cool when nobody had GPS. It reflects the visions of the cyberpunk literature and cultural movements of the late '80s and early '90s, which has some relevance, but has morphed beyond recognition. In actual 1999, I found a great prophetic irony in the opening lines: "1999 was the year the Indian Nuclear Satellite went out of control. No one knew where it might land. It soared above the ozone layer like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed..." I rewrote them to reflect the actual reality: 1999 was the year the dot com and Y2K bug hype went out of control. No one knew where it might end. It soared above our corporate servers and venture-capital-burn-rate like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed... So there are some decently interesting science fiction aspects to this movie, but I would say that this is actually the ultimate art film as road movie. Just see "Wings Of Desire" if you don't think Wenders is an art film director. Of course I have to give it extra points just for spending extra time in one of my favorite world-class bars - the Tosca. Even though this is a cyberpunk sci-fi film, and an art film and a road film, it manages ultimately to be introspectively psychological (as do all Wenders films that I have seen so far). I cannot watch this movie without shedding at least a tear for the beautiful and talented Solveig Dommarten, whose career and life were cut far too short. I see other reviews talking about the lack of story. This movie is better watched as painting - the title or theme may be short, but it unfolds in the tasting of the experience of the images, some of which were pretty striking in 1991. I thought the theatrical release was pretty good at the time, but if you can, slow down and watch the 5 hour trilogy version (a third at a time).

    I first learned of this film after stumbling across its soundtrack. Upon learning that it's a piece of science fiction, I decided to give the film a try. Bad news first: the film is long. It runs for a good two-and-a-half hours, but incredibly, it's only the short version; the rough cut was originally eight hours long, and the director's preferred version is 280 minutes. Even at 150 minutes, this film feels long and it drags at times. That doesn't mean it's a total bore. The film is pretty evenly split in half (for the theatrical cut anyway; the director's cut is supposedly arranged as a three-part trilogy). The first half is easily the most interesting and thrilling, as it follows this woman all across Europe and Asia and everywhere else, investigating some shady people and mysterious devices and roaming around some strange post-modern futuristic settings. It comes off much like a sci-fi film noir, somewhat akin to Brazil, but nowhere near as goofy. In the film's last half, with a great catastrophe befalling the Earth, the characters wind up holing themselves up somewhere in Australia, where they bum around for the remainder of the picture. I found this part far less interesting, but it offers a few interesting ideas (including one key aspect that echoes Inception a lot). Altogether, I'd say that it's an interesting film with lots of interesting ideas and plot points, but it achieves the type of pacing that straddles the threshold of being fascinating and unfascinating. If anything in the above paragraph indicates anything, it's that the story itself is pretty sound and full of neat ideas. It's populated by interesting characters. I really don't have many complaints about the story, other than it felt like it trailed off in the end. This film looks neat, with quality photography and editing. Acting is swell: I did get a kick out of watching William Hurt, Sam Niell, and Solveig Dommartin in their roles (and Max Von Sydow makes an appearance toward the end). Writing is alright. This production does its best to use then-modern sets, props, and costumes for a futuristic look, but with mixed results. Frankly, parts of the film look cheap and cheesy, in a manner no different than Paul Verhoeven's films. Still, it gets the job done. Music is pretty cool. It's an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. It is a shame that this film was a commercial and critical failure on its release, because it's not that bad at all. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    Many say that the 4.5 hour version is much better than the 2.5 hour. I guess there were even eight-hour and twenty-hour versions. The 2.5 version hobbles along after the first hour. I can't imagine more than this. I didn't sense any great examination of the human condition. It was pretentious and self-serving. (I have a crappy job where the time crawls by and I'd gladly go there vs. another minute of this.) Closely following that was the illogic in many elements of the story. The bank robbers wanted the girl to carry the money to France. Why? The good guy steals SOME of the money? The bank robbers finally come back for their money. I GUESS they got it all. Very forgiving bank robbers. Basically my problem is that the money was stolen and stolen and stolen and there was plenty left over. And the film was way too forgiving of this girl. She runs all over the world to get her money back and for the love of this guy. I found it silly. And the bank robber gladly shows up in the 2nd hour to help this girl? I guess French bank robbers are pansies. The zapping of all the electrical devices was lifted directly from Escape from L.A. I was surprised how short-sighted the technology of it all was for being made in '91. Then they lost me when he met up with his parents. I didn't see the great psychological discussions that everyone else did. And why did he travel the world with that stupid camera? If the point was to see if the mother could see with this camera, then go outside for ten minutes and film a bush. Or the house cat. But NOOOO. We have to take two years to do that? After the ten minutes and it works, then put the camera in front of the Travel Channel. I'm sorry. My bad. Then there would be no movie and no room for bad overacting.

    I guess the question you have to ask yourself if considering taking on this film is, Do I want to spend almost 5 hours of my life on this? The conception of the film is ambitious and brilliant, it covers a huge amount of ground. It's visually stunning, and the choice of music and its melding with scenes and moods is inspired - especially Ray Davies' 'Thank You for the Days' whenever it appears. But does the film actually work? Unfortunately not. And the main reason for this, for a native English speaker, is that we have non-native speakers of English being directed by a non-native speaker of English. Although novelist Peter Carey had a hand in the writing, he obviously didn't help Wenders with the directing. So many of the lines are badly delivered, and much of the acting is wooden. Even actors of the stature of Jeanne Moreau and Max von Sydow can't deliver lines in English without good direction. Maybe it all sounded good to Wim, but sorry Wim, it doesn't work for Anglophones. Even William Hurt's and Sam Neill's lines often fall flat. If you speak German, try the German version - it sounded better to me. Otherwise, why not spend the time watching 'Wings of Desire' TWICE, or watch three of Wenders' great early films? They are much more rewarding.

    I'm not really a Wim Wenders fanboy. I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the "objectively good, yet too slowly paced" art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders. However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, "Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me." Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects: the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams. Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, "This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax?" Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from. I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, "Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him," give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though. I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams "Wim Wenders" to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

    This is my favourite film but it will not be to everyone's taste. The mix of whimsy and melancholy will puzzle some, who may ask how seriously they are meant to take it? Its length and occasional problems with continuity will put others off. Added to this, what is intended to be the central romantic relationship never quite convinces. But the film as a whole is redeemed by its sheer ambition and, most importantly, the humanity and the generosity of its vision. It's 1999 - that's seven years into the future - and the world is threatened by an orbiting satellite that carries a powerful nuclear device. Meanwhile, Henry Farber has stolen a camera of his own invention from the American government, not trusting the uses to which they might put it. He sends his son, Sam, around the world, collecting images with this device. These images are to be electronically projected into the brain of Henry's blind wife, Edith. On his travels, Sam picks up a stalker, Claire Tourneur, who is on the rebound from a broken relationship with the writer, Gene FitzPatrick. Sam collects images for his mother. Claire chases Sam. Gene chases Claire. The investigator, Philip Winter, who appeared in Wenders' previous film, 'Alice in the Cities,' chases all of them. Eventually, everyone ends up at Henry's lab in the Australian outback, the satellite having exploded and, with all communication cut off, no-one being sure whether the world is still alive. Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive. And there's more to it than that. Much more. As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD. Not to everyone's taste then, but those of us who like it, love it.

And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag. I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out "Wings of Desire", and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini... Even if you like this film, believe me, you CAN do MUCH better, so keep looking!

    You know you are in trouble when the comments on the back of the DVD packaging say "visually stunning", because this is the inevitable comment on a film which has a rambling disjointed plot and below par acting. And so it was. Way, way too long at almost 3 hours the story is played out across the world. The characters are flat and unengaging - the two male leads being played by Sam Neil and William Hurt who specialise in alienation and distance. Neil's facial expression is the same whether he is in love, being betrayed, chasing the bad guy, being mugged, or watching his beloved in agony. Even the most emotionally charged part of the film - in the father-son relationship during the last third - is clich&eacute;d (with Max von Sydow playing to type) and stilted. The plot twists and turns, but in the end leaves many things unexplained - it's not at all clear why Hurt is being pursued in the end or who the people were that pursued him. It all gets resolved by the supposed disaster which never materialises - a disaster movie with no disaster, an apocalypse with no horsemen. It's full of disjointed parts that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Many of the scenes are completely flat and add nothing. When Hurt wakes up between two elders, they seem to be as baffled by their appearance in the movie as I was, and he is as unreadable as ever. The idea of hiding away in Australia with a tribe of Aboriginals is somewhat novel, but this is a white man's fantasy I think - they are a group of Man Friday's who attend to his every need, although there is a step too far and they do leave him which once again is done with minimal emotion. The whole thing was as dry as the Aussie desert. Maybe you had to see it on the big screen, but in the end I did not believe the film was visual stunning - it used some stock shots of the Australian Outback but there was nothing very interesting in the way the film was shot. I found myself earnestly wishing for the end of the movie, if not the world.

    I find this film to be beyond description - in some ways it is dated - the car map system looked cool when nobody had GPS. It reflects the visions of the cyberpunk literature and cultural movements of the late '80s and early '90s, which has some relevance, but has morphed beyond recognition. In actual 1999, I found a great prophetic irony in the opening lines: "1999 was the year the Indian Nuclear Satellite went out of control. No one knew where it might land. It soared above the ozone layer like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed..." I rewrote them to reflect the actual reality: 1999 was the year the dot com and Y2K bug hype went out of control. No one knew where it might end. It soared above our corporate servers and venture-capital-burn-rate like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed... So there are some decently interesting science fiction aspects to this movie, but I would say that this is actually the ultimate art film as road movie. Just see "Wings Of Desire" if you don't think Wenders is an art film director. Of course I have to give it extra points just for spending extra time in one of my favorite world-class bars - the Tosca. Even though this is a cyberpunk sci-fi film, and an art film and a road film, it manages ultimately to be introspectively psychological (as do all Wenders films that I have seen so far). I cannot watch this movie without shedding at least a tear for the beautiful and talented Solveig Dommarten, whose career and life were cut far too short. I see other reviews talking about the lack of story. This movie is better watched as painting - the title or theme may be short, but it unfolds in the tasting of the experience of the images, some of which were pretty striking in 1991. I thought the theatrical release was pretty good at the time, but if you can, slow down and watch the 5 hour trilogy version (a third at a time).

    I first learned of this film after stumbling across its soundtrack. Upon learning that it's a piece of science fiction, I decided to give the film a try. Bad news first: the film is long. It runs for a good two-and-a-half hours, but incredibly, it's only the short version; the rough cut was originally eight hours long, and the director's preferred version is 280 minutes. Even at 150 minutes, this film feels long and it drags at times. That doesn't mean it's a total bore. The film is pretty evenly split in half (for the theatrical cut anyway; the director's cut is supposedly arranged as a three-part trilogy). The first half is easily the most interesting and thrilling, as it follows this woman all across Europe and Asia and everywhere else, investigating some shady people and mysterious devices and roaming around some strange post-modern futuristic settings. It comes off much like a sci-fi film noir, somewhat akin to Brazil, but nowhere near as goofy. In the film's last half, with a great catastrophe befalling the Earth, the characters wind up holing themselves up somewhere in Australia, where they bum around for the remainder of the picture. I found this part far less interesting, but it offers a few interesting ideas (including one key aspect that echoes Inception a lot). Altogether, I'd say that it's an interesting film with lots of interesting ideas and plot points, but it achieves the type of pacing that straddles the threshold of being fascinating and unfascinating. If anything in the above paragraph indicates anything, it's that the story itself is pretty sound and full of neat ideas. It's populated by interesting characters. I really don't have many complaints about the story, other than it felt like it trailed off in the end. This film looks neat, with quality photography and editing. Acting is swell: I did get a kick out of watching William Hurt, Sam Niell, and Solveig Dommartin in their roles (and Max Von Sydow makes an appearance toward the end). Writing is alright. This production does its best to use then-modern sets, props, and costumes for a futuristic look, but with mixed results. Frankly, parts of the film look cheap and cheesy, in a manner no different than Paul Verhoeven's films. Still, it gets the job done. Music is pretty cool. It's an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. It is a shame that this film was a commercial and critical failure on its release, because it's not that bad at all. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    Many say that the 4.5 hour version is much better than the 2.5 hour. I guess there were even eight-hour and twenty-hour versions. The 2.5 version hobbles along after the first hour. I can't imagine more than this. I didn't sense any great examination of the human condition. It was pretentious and self-serving. (I have a crappy job where the time crawls by and I'd gladly go there vs. another minute of this.) Closely following that was the illogic in many elements of the story. The bank robbers wanted the girl to carry the money to France. Why? The good guy steals SOME of the money? The bank robbers finally come back for their money. I GUESS they got it all. Very forgiving bank robbers. Basically my problem is that the money was stolen and stolen and stolen and there was plenty left over. And the film was way too forgiving of this girl. She runs all over the world to get her money back and for the love of this guy. I found it silly. And the bank robber gladly shows up in the 2nd hour to help this girl? I guess French bank robbers are pansies. The zapping of all the electrical devices was lifted directly from Escape from L.A. I was surprised how short-sighted the technology of it all was for being made in '91. Then they lost me when he met up with his parents. I didn't see the great psychological discussions that everyone else did. And why did he travel the world with that stupid camera? If the point was to see if the mother could see with this camera, then go outside for ten minutes and film a bush. Or the house cat. But NOOOO. We have to take two years to do that? After the ten minutes and it works, then put the camera in front of the Travel Channel. I'm sorry. My bad. Then there would be no movie and no room for bad overacting.

    I guess the question you have to ask yourself if considering taking on this film is, Do I want to spend almost 5 hours of my life on this? The conception of the film is ambitious and brilliant, it covers a huge amount of ground. It's visually stunning, and the choice of music and its melding with scenes and moods is inspired - especially Ray Davies' 'Thank You for the Days' whenever it appears. But does the film actually work? Unfortunately not. And the main reason for this, for a native English speaker, is that we have non-native speakers of English being directed by a non-native speaker of English. Although novelist Peter Carey had a hand in the writing, he obviously didn't help Wenders with the directing. So many of the lines are badly delivered, and much of the acting is wooden. Even actors of the stature of Jeanne Moreau and Max von Sydow can't deliver lines in English without good direction. Maybe it all sounded good to Wim, but sorry Wim, it doesn't work for Anglophones. Even William Hurt's and Sam Neill's lines often fall flat. If you speak German, try the German version - it sounded better to me. Otherwise, why not spend the time watching 'Wings of Desire' TWICE, or watch three of Wenders' great early films? They are much more rewarding.

    I'm not really a Wim Wenders fanboy. I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the "objectively good, yet too slowly paced" art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders. However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, "Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me." Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects: the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams. Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, "This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax?" Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from. I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, "Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him," give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though. I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams "Wim Wenders" to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

    A Film about a Camera that Takes Pictures that Blind People Can See

    This is my favourite film but it will not be to everyone's taste. The mix of whimsy and melancholy will puzzle some, who may ask how seriously they are meant to take it? Its length and occasional problems with continuity will put others off. Added to this, what is intended to be the central romantic relationship never quite convinces. But the film as a whole is redeemed by its sheer ambition and, most importantly, the humanity and the generosity of its vision. It's 1999 - that's seven years into the future - and the world is threatened by an orbiting satellite that carries a powerful nuclear device. Meanwhile, Henry Farber has stolen a camera of his own invention from the American government, not trusting the uses to which they might put it. He sends his son, Sam, around the world, collecting images with this device. These images are to be electronically projected into the brain of Henry's blind wife, Edith. On his travels, Sam picks up a stalker, Claire Tourneur, who is on the rebound from a broken relationship with the writer, Gene FitzPatrick. Sam collects images for his mother. Claire chases Sam. Gene chases Claire. The investigator, Philip Winter, who appeared in Wenders' previous film, 'Alice in the Cities,' chases all of them. Eventually, everyone ends up at Henry's lab in the Australian outback, the satellite having exploded and, with all communication cut off, no-one being sure whether the world is still alive. Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive. And there's more to it than that. Much more. As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD. Not to everyone's taste then, but those of us who like it, love it.

    At a whopping 280 minutes, Wender's intended length of his sci-fi epic Until the End of the World might actually make some wish the world was ending, but for those of us willing to commit the time, the Director's cut is a rewarding experience. The 150 minute theatrical version of the film was criticized for being overly ambitious, disjointed and underdeveloped, while the Director's cut not only fills in these blanks, it fleshes out this fascinating story about how we see the world around us, the search for identity within that world and our obsessive/destructive interface with technology as a means to process reality, both conscious and unconscious. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/

    Let me make this short and straight. Just avoid it, I mean it. I was somehow dragged into watching this and this was a real torture. How can you rate this as Sci-Fi. Even 50 years ago people could do much better effects. Don't tell me this is a style thing. If so, then call this as crap fiction, not science fiction. There was no story and the whole movie so boring. Even if you are forced to watch it, avoid the long version by all means for your own mental health. I don't troll movies but this one really deserves a good kick so that people that doesn't have the slightest clue about technology does not attempt to produce yet another garbage like this.

    1st: I have only watched the long(est) version of this movie once. 2nd: Wenders' "Wings of Desire" (Der Himmel &uuml;ber Berlin) is pretty much literally my favorite movie ever. 3rd: I have LOVED plenty of films that are any combination of long, abstract, meandering, foreign, low on action or even plot, with supposedly realistic, down to earth characters, etc. etc. etc. 4th: I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this "science fiction". Even more so to call it "cyberpunk". I just have trouble believing that just because you incorporate a few elements of sci-fi and film-noir detective genres in a near-future setting, it is just automatically cyberpunk. And even just to call it science fiction... the supposed overall premise that the world could end due to a nuclear satellite destabilizing is not actually particularly science fiction (nor even hardly realistically scientifically plausible) but it's pretty much completely ignored for the entire movie, so what does it matter. likewise, the "device" is little more than a generic "MacGuffin" for most of the film, and when they finally do get into it, it is with the shallowest, most cursory glossing over of any interesting exploration of the concepts, remaining little more than a MacGuffin still; a random crux for some ridiculous, muddled new-age psycho-babble philosophical wanking, which doesn't really go anywhere or last very long; just seems to be a random way of ending that part of the film. Anyway, if you really were interested in checking out some real sci-fi about topics such as these, you could so easily do SOOO much better, so don't get roped into watching this just because the sci-fi aspect sounds interesting. about the only interesting thing in that regard is that they somehow managed to predict modern automobile sat-nav units pretty much exactly!! So, all that out of the way, this movie is obviously VERY long. I am almost curious that a better edited version could be more interesting, but I don't really see how that's possible. It's the content, not the length, that failed to keep my interest. I did find it pretty interesting in the beginning, enjoyed the bit in Japan, and the Australia where most of the rest of the film took place seemed remarkably realistic and down to earth compared to typical depictions, so that was somewhat interesting. But in general it just wandered nowhere so aimlessly... I doubt it's true, but I really got the feel that they were just making this up as they went along past the initial setup, and really could not figure out where to take it without writing around in circles, into corners, through ridiculous plot-holes, trailing loose ends all along the way. Of course, this wouldn't be so bad considering Wenders' penchant for stunning, timeless cinematography, directing, pacing, and phenomenally real, alive, emotionally transparent acting... but shockingly none of that is in evidence here! about all this albatross has going for it is a few interesting characters, a few pretty good minor actors, and a rather cute, intriguing leading lady, but even that wasn't nearly enough to carry it past the first two hours. The use of various languages could have been interesting, but I just found it jarring and unnatural. While it seems that many of the actors were pretty gifted in at least one language, they end up speaking a lot in other languages, particularly English, in which their performance seemed severely curtailed. Absurdly enough, the well established American actors actually tend to give some of the most wooden, hokey, unbelievable deliveries in English on here! And i generally do like them in other films I've seen. It's all pretty inexplicable. I can't find myself believing most of what takes place in this film. Other reviews on IMDb have pointed out a few of the ridiculous plot holes and pointlessly unrealistic plot twists, and I'm not much inspired to suffer remembering it to point out more; there are PLENTY. But even when you ignore these technical blunders, the main dramatic story line just makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why does she suddenly fall in love with some random guy just because she runs into him on her little adventure, gives him a ride, and he steals some of her money? i certainly see no chemistry or connection whatsoever between them at that point; it's completely out of nowhere. And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag. I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out "Wings of Desire", and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini... Even if you like this film, believe me, you CAN do MUCH better, so keep looking!

    I find this film to be beyond description - in some ways it is dated - the car map system looked cool when nobody had GPS. It reflects the visions of the cyberpunk literature and cultural movements of the late '80s and early '90s, which has some relevance, but has morphed beyond recognition. In actual 1999, I found a great prophetic irony in the opening lines: "1999 was the year the Indian Nuclear Satellite went out of control. No one knew where it might land. It soared above the ozone layer like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed..." I rewrote them to reflect the actual reality: 1999 was the year the dot com and Y2K bug hype went out of control. No one knew where it might end. It soared above our corporate servers and venture-capital-burn-rate like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed... So there are some decently interesting science fiction aspects to this movie, but I would say that this is actually the ultimate art film as road movie. Just see "Wings Of Desire" if you don't think Wenders is an art film director. Of course I have to give it extra points just for spending extra time in one of my favorite world-class bars - the Tosca. Even though this is a cyberpunk sci-fi film, and an art film and a road film, it manages ultimately to be introspectively psychological (as do all Wenders films that I have seen so far).

    I first learned of this film after stumbling across its soundtrack. Upon learning that it's a piece of science fiction, I decided to give the film a try. Bad news first: the film is long. It runs for a good two-and-a-half hours, but incredibly, it's only the short version; the rough cut was originally eight hours long, and the director's preferred version is 280 minutes. Even at 150 minutes, this film feels long and it drags at times. That doesn't mean it's a total bore. The film is pretty evenly split in half (for the theatrical cut anyway; the director's cut is supposedly arranged as a three-part trilogy). The first half is easily the most interesting and thrilling, as it follows this woman all across Europe and Asia and everywhere else, investigating some shady people and mysterious devices and roaming around some strange post-modern futuristic settings. It comes off much like a sci-fi film noir, somewhat akin to Brazil, but nowhere near as goofy. In the film's last half, with a great catastrophe befalling the Earth, the characters wind up holing themselves up somewhere in Australia, where they bum around for the remainder of the picture. I found this part far less interesting, but it offers a few interesting ideas (including one key aspect that echoes Inception a lot). Altogether, I'd say that it's an interesting film with lots of interesting ideas and plot points, but it achieves the type of pacing that straddles the threshold of being fascinating and unfascinating. If anything in the above paragraph indicates anything, it's that the story itself is pretty sound and full of neat ideas. It's populated by interesting characters. I really don't have many complaints about the story, other than it felt like it trailed off in the end. This film looks neat, with quality photography and editing. Acting is swell: I did get a kick out of watching William Hurt, Sam Niell, and Solveig Dommartin in their roles (and Max Von Sydow makes an appearance toward the end). Writing is alright. This production does its best to use then-modern sets, props, and costumes for a futuristic look, but with mixed results. Frankly, parts of the film look cheap and cheesy, in a manner no different than Paul Verhoeven's films. Still, it gets the job done. Music is pretty cool. It's an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. It is a shame that this film was a commercial and critical failure on its release, because it's not that bad at all. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)

    Many say that the 4.5 hour version is much better than the 2.5 hour. I guess there were even eight-hour and twenty-hour versions. The 2.5 version hobbles along after the first hour. I can't imagine more than this. I didn't sense any great examination of the human condition. It was pretentious and self-serving. (I have a crappy job where the time crawls by and I'd gladly go there vs. another minute of this.) Closely following that was the illogic in many elements of the story. The bank robbers wanted the girl to carry the money to France. Why? The good guy steals SOME of the money? The bank robbers finally come back for their money. I GUESS they got it all. Very forgiving bank robbers. Basically my problem is that the money was stolen and stolen and stolen and there was plenty left over. And the film was way too forgiving of this girl. She runs all over the world to get her money back and for the love of this guy. I found it silly. And the bank robber gladly shows up in the 2nd hour to help this girl? I guess French bank robbers are pansies. The zapping of all the electrical devices was lifted directly from Escape from L.A. I was surprised how short-sighted the technology of it all was for being made in '91. Then they lost me when he met up with his parents. I didn't see the great psychological discussions that everyone else did. And why did he travel the world with that stupid camera? If the point was to see if the mother could see with this camera, then go outside for ten minutes and film a bush. Or the house cat. But NOOOO. We have to take two years to do that? After the ten minutes and it works, then put the camera in front of the Travel Channel. I'm sorry. My bad. Then there would be no movie and no room for bad overacting.

    I guess the question you have to ask yourself if considering taking on this film is, Do I want to spend almost 5 hours of my life on this? The conception of the film is ambitious and brilliant, it covers a huge amount of ground. It's visually stunning, and the choice of music and its melding with scenes and moods is inspired - especially Ray Davies' 'Thank You for the Days' whenever it appears. But does the film actually work? Unfortunately not. And the main reason for this, for a native English speaker, is that we have non-native speakers of English being directed by a non-native speaker of English. Although novelist Peter Carey had a hand in the writing, he obviously didn't help Wenders with the directing. So many of the lines are badly delivered, and much of the acting is wooden. Even actors of the stature of Jeanne Moreau and Max von Sydow can't deliver lines in English without good direction. Maybe it all sounded good to Wim, but sorry Wim, it doesn't work for Anglophones. Even William Hurt's and Sam Neill's lines often fall flat. If you speak German, try the German version - it sounded better to me. Otherwise, why not spend the time watching 'Wings of Desire' TWICE, or watch three of Wenders' great early films? They are much more rewarding.

    I'm not really a Wim Wenders fanboy. I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the "objectively good, yet too slowly paced" art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders. However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, "Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me." Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects: the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams. Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, "This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax?" Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from. I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, "Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him," give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though. I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams "Wim Wenders" to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

    A Film about a Camera that Takes Pictures that Blind People Can See

    This is my favourite film but it will not be to everyone's taste. The mix of whimsy and melancholy will puzzle some, who may ask how seriously they are meant to take it? Its length and occasional problems with continuity will put others off. Added to this, what is intended to be the central romantic relationship never quite convinces. But the film as a whole is redeemed by its sheer ambition and, most importantly, the humanity and the generosity of its vision. It's 1999 - that's seven years into the future - and the world is threatened by an orbiting satellite that carries a powerful nuclear device. Meanwhile, Henry Farber has stolen a camera of his own invention from the American government, not trusting the uses to which they might put it. He sends his son, Sam, around the world, collecting images with this device. These images are to be electronically projected into the brain of Henry's blind wife, Edith. On his travels, Sam picks up a stalker, Claire Tourneur, who is on the rebound from a broken relationship with the writer, Gene FitzPatrick. Sam collects images for his mother. Claire chases Sam. Gene chases Claire. The investigator, Philip Winter, who appeared in Wenders' previous film, 'Alice in the Cities,' chases all of them. Eventually, everyone ends up at Henry's lab in the Australian outback, the satellite having exploded and, with all communication cut off, no-one being sure whether the world is still alive. Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive. And there's more to it than that. Much more. As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD. Not to everyone's taste then, but those of us who like it, love it.

    At a whopping 280 minutes, Wender's intended length of his sci-fi epic Until the End of the World might actually make some wish the world was ending, but for those of us willing to commit the time, the Director's cut is a rewarding experience. The 150 minute theatrical version of the film was criticized for being overly ambitious, disjointed and underdeveloped, while the Director's cut not only fills in these blanks, it fleshes out this fascinating story about how we see the world around us, the search for identity within that world and our obsessive/destructive interface with technology as a means to process reality, both conscious and unconscious. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/

    Let me make this short and straight. Just avoid it, I mean it. I was somehow dragged into watching this and this was a real torture. How can you rate this as Sci-Fi. Even 50 years ago people could do much better effects. Don't tell me this is a style thing. If so, then call this as crap fiction, not science fiction. There was no story and the whole movie so boring. Even if you are forced to watch it, avoid the long version by all means for your own mental health. I don't troll movies but this one really deserves a good kick so that people that doesn't have the slightest clue about technology does not attempt to produce yet another garbage like this.

    1st: I have only watched the long(est) version of this movie once. 2nd: Wenders' "Wings of Desire" (Der Himmel &uuml;ber Berlin) is pretty much literally my favorite movie ever. 3rd: I have LOVED plenty of films that are any combination of long, abstract, meandering, foreign, low on action or even plot, with supposedly realistic, down to earth characters, etc. etc. etc. 4th: I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this "science fiction". Even more so to call it "cyberpunk". I just have trouble believing that just because you incorporate a few elements of sci-fi and film-noir detective genres in a near-future setting, it is just automatically cyberpunk. And even just to call it science fiction... the supposed overall premise that the world could end due to a nuclear satellite destabilizing is not actually particularly science fiction (nor even hardly realistically scientifically plausible) but it's pretty much completely ignored for the entire movie, so what does it matter. likewise, the "device" is little more than a generic "MacGuffin" for most of the film, and when they finally do get into it, it is with the shallowest, most cursory glossing over of any interesting exploration of the concepts, remaining little more than a MacGuffin still; a random crux for some ridiculous, muddled new-age psycho-babble philosophical wanking, which doesn't really go anywhere or last very long; just seems to be a random way of ending that part of the film. Anyway, if you really were interested in checking out some real sci-fi about topics such as these, you could so easily do SOOO much better, so don't get roped into watching this just because the sci-fi aspect sounds interesting. about the only interesting thing in that regard is that they somehow managed to predict modern automobile sat-nav units pretty much exactly!! So, all that out of the way, this movie is obviously VERY long. I am almost curious that a better edited version could be more interesting, but I don't really see how that's possible. It's the content, not the length, that failed to keep my interest. I did find it pretty interesting in the beginning, enjoyed the bit in Japan, and the Australia where most of the rest of the film took place seemed remarkably realistic and down to earth compared to typical depictions, so that was somewhat interesting. But in general it just wandered nowhere so aimlessly... I doubt it's true, but I really got the feel that they were just making this up as they went along past the initial setup, and really could not figure out where to take it without writing around in circles, into corners, through ridiculous plot-holes, trailing loose ends all along the way. Of course, this wouldn't be so bad considering Wenders' penchant for stunning, timeless cinematography, directing, pacing, and phenomenally real, alive, emotionally transparent acting... but shockingly none of that is in evidence here! about all this albatross has going for it is a few interesting characters, a few pretty good minor actors, and a rather cute, intriguing leading lady, but even that wasn't nearly enough to carry it past the first two hours. The use of various languages could have been interesting, but I just found it jarring and unnatural. While it seems that many of the actors were pretty gifted in at least one language, they end up speaking a lot in other languages, particularly English, in which their performance seemed severely curtailed. Absurdly enough, the well established American actors actually tend to give some of the most wooden, hokey, unbelievable deliveries in English on here! And i generally do like them in other films I've seen. It's all pretty inexplicable. I can't find myself believing most of what takes place in this film. Other reviews on IMDb have pointed out a few of the ridiculous plot holes and pointlessly unrealistic plot twists, and I'm not much inspired to suffer remembering it to point out more; there are PLENTY. But even when you ignore these technical blunders, the main dramatic story line just makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why does she suddenly fall in love with some random guy just because she runs into him on her little adventure, gives him a ride, and he steals some of her money? i certainly see no chemistry or connection whatsoever between them at that point; it's completely out of nowhere. And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag. I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out "Wings of Desire", and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini... Even if you like this film, believe me, you CAN do MUCH better, so keep looking!

    You know you are in trouble when the comments on the back of the DVD packaging say "visually stunning", because this is the inevitable comment on a film which has a rambling disjointed plot and below par acting. And so it was. Way, way too long at almost 3 hours the story is played out across the world. The characters are flat and unengaging - the two male leads being played by Sam Neil and William Hurt who specialise in alienation and distance. Neil's facial expression is the same whether he is in love, being betrayed, chasing the bad guy, being mugged, or watching his beloved in agony. Even the most emotionally charged part of the film - in the father-son relationship during the last third - is clich&eacute;d (with Max von Sydow playing to type) and stilted. The plot twists and turns, but in the end leaves many things unexplained - it's not at all clear why Hurt is being pursued in the end or who the people were that pursued him. It all gets resolved by the supposed disaster which never materialises - a disaster movie with no disaster, an apocalypse with no horsemen. It's full of disjointed parts that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Many of the scenes are completely flat and add nothing. When Hurt wakes up between two elders, they seem to be as baffled by their appearance in the movie as I was, and he is as unreadable as ever. The idea of hiding away in Australia with a tribe of Aboriginals is somewhat novel, but this is a white man's fantasy I think - they are a group of Man Friday's who attend to his every need, although there is a step too far and they do leave him which once again is done with minimal emotion. The whole thing was as dry as the Aussie desert. Maybe you had to see it on the big screen, but in the end I did not believe the film was visual stunning - it used some stock shots of the Australian Outback but there was nothing very interesting in the way the film was shot. I found myself earnestly wishing for the end of the movie, if not the world.

    I find this film to be beyond description - in some ways it is dated - the car map system looked cool when nobody had GPS. It reflects the visions of the cyberpunk literature and cultural movements of the late '80s and early '90s, which has some relevance, but has morphed beyond recognition. In actual 1999, I found a great prophetic irony in the opening lines: "1999 was the year the Indian Nuclear Satellite went out of control. No one knew where it might land. It soared above the ozone layer like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed..." I rewrote them to reflect the actual reality: 1999 was the year the dot com and Y2K bug hype went out of control. No one knew where it might end. It soared above our corporate servers and venture-capital-burn-rate like a lethal bird of prey. The whole world was alarmed... So there are some decently interesting science fiction aspects to this movie, but I would say that this is actually the ultimate art film as road movie. Just see "Wings Of Desire" if you don't think Wenders is an art film director. Of course I have to give it extra points just for spending extra time in one of my favorite world-class bars - the Tosca. Even though this is a cyberpunk sci-fi film, and an art film and a road film, it manages ultimately to be introspectively psychological (as do all Wenders films that I have seen so far). I cannot watch this movie without shedding at least a tear for the beautiful and talented Solveig Dommarten, whose career and life were cut far too short. I see other reviews talking about the lack of story. This movie is better watched as painting - the title or theme may be short, but it unfolds in the tasting of the experience of the images, some of which were pretty striking in 1991. I thought the theatrical release was pretty good at the time, but if you can, slow down and watch the 5 hour trilogy version (a third at a time).
