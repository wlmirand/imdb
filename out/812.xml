 <sinopse>
  The true story of how a marine sea lion named Andre befriended a little girl and her family, circa 1962.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Toni Whitney and her family adopt a baby sea lion. When it grows and starts getting into mischief, it antagonizes some of the fisherman in the town. One of the fisherman, Billy Baker, is upset with the Whitney's because Toni's father, Harry, was appointed Harbor Master instead of him, partially because of the seal. But when the humorous antics of the sea lion attracts media attention, further squeezing out Mark, and running down his business, he gets even more upset.

    Hi, I'm Camille Bajema reporting for KIDS FIRST! and today I'm reviewing the 1994 film "Andre," based on the book "A Seal Called Andre" which is based on a true story. I like this film because I'm an animal lover and this film is filled with animals. "Andre" is about a little girl, Toni Whitney, played by Tina Majorina, who lives with her parents Harry and Thalice, played by Shane Meier and Chelsea Field; her sister, Paula, played by Aidan Pendleton; and her brother Steve, played by Keith Carradine. They have an assortment of animals, and decide to adopt an orphaned, baby seal that that they name Andre. Andre lives with the Whitney's for a few years, until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take Andre away! My favorite character in this film is Toni's mother, Thalice. I like Thalice because she is very loving toward her kids, yet also knows how to discipline them. My favorite scene in this movie is when Andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier. I like this scene because Andre is so cute and fun. An interesting fact is that Andre is played by a sea lion, not a seal, in the movie. "Andre" is directed by George Miller and produced by Annette Handley. The music in this film sets the mood. The movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in Rockport, Maine and I especially love the cinematography when the seasons change. This movie is a tear-jerker and Toni learns that despite how much she loves Andre she may have to let him go. This is a family-friendly movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. I give this film five-out-of- five stars because I thought that the movie was really well-done overall and had a great plot. I am pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much because the picture on the cover made me think that it would appeal to a younger audience.

    There's really no need to go much in depth into this movie. It based on the true story of Andre the seal, a harbour seal rescued as a pup after losing his mother and raised by a human family in Rockport, Maine. It's basically the story of his interactions with the family, and with the variety of other animals that the family had in their home. There's a little bit of human drama involved, but mostly it's the story of Andre, and especially his relationship with young Toni (Tina Majorino), the youngest daughter of the family who develops a special bond with Andre, who eventually ends up spending his winters in the Boston Aquarium and then returns to the family in Rockport every year until he dies of old age 24 years later. The story is basically told from Toni's perspective. It's a fine family film. Most of the cast aren't especially well known, but that's fine, because the star of the movie is really Andre. It's a movie you can sit down and watch with your kids for an enjoyable evening at home. Nothing more than that - but sometimes that's quite enough. (7/10)

    Andre is a very sweet type of film, maybe too sickly sweet, but it is very nice and endearing. There are some slow moments in the middling half and some of the writing gets a tad mawkish. That said, the acting is fine, Tina Majorino is really good as the animal-loving daughter who befriends the seal, and it was really nice to see Keith Carradine in a somewhat atypical role as he portrayed the most likable human character. The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery is magical and the music is lovely. What makes Andre though is the seal Andre, played in real-life by a sea-lion. Andre is one lovable character, he is so cute, endearing and funny. His scenes with Majorino were very touching, and he just steals the film from everybody else with effortless ease. Overall, a very sweet but enjoyable family fare, and I just want to add I noticed no rip-off of anything, then again I am not as observant as some people. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    This is probably my favorite movie ever. Its amazing.. i've probably seen it at least 50 times. It's a great movie for the whole family and I promise anyone who sees it will love it. You will want to watch it over and over again, one time is not enough. Three times is really not enough. The story of a seal and the family who takes him in is amazing, all of the details which are added make it even better. All of the characters are interesting. The movie will make you laugh and cry, but you'l'l be smiling all the way through. It makes you want to find a seal of your own, if thats possible. The characters are people you will want to meet, if not for their great personality then for your own amusement. When I have children, I will show them this movie at least as many times as I have seen it. You should watch this movie- it's my absolute favorite and you will definitely love it.

    GOOD - What gave this movie appeal and made it a bit different is that a seal is the star. The likable seal, "Andre," (in real life, Tory, the sea lion) has cute face with big brown eyes and likes to stick his tongue out and give everyone "the raspberry." The latter joke is way overdone, but it's okay. The most likable human is the father, played by Keith Carradine. The kids are somewhat spoiled but the little one, the star (Tina Majorino) isn't bad. THE BAD - Too much typical Hollywood families in which (1) there is a stupid teen romance with a rebellious, pouting female teen; (2) the nasty foe who makes trouble for no apparent reason; (3) the nice-guy husband who gets unfairly blamed or is proved wrong in family affairs (the Liberal mother always winning out). OVERALL - A little more of the seal and less of the teen girls and other annoying people would have made this a lot better. As it is, one viewing was enough.

    It was only when I saw the credits, I then understand it's based on a true story. It made me smile even more. So I guessed I knew why I saw this few days back for a reason. The trailers had won me over and when I saw the movie itself, it was just so heart-warming. Toni's attachment to Andre is one maybe I can sort of relate to. Sentimental attachment to something where one have feeling for after sometime. Throw in a bit of drama as well, and one can see how Toni reacts especially to how others who don't really like Andre's sudden popularity in the town. This is just one of those where the family can all enjoy it together. Sometimes we just need a bit of old-fashioned goodness. Quite a heart-warming movie.

    Well, yes, this movie was probably the best kid's movie i've seen in a long time. couple of swears, and it WASN'T a rip off of Free Willy. Free Willy was a rip off of Andre. How do i know? Because this movie is based on a true story. Willy isn't. The movie starts with a young girl marrying off a sparrow (or some kind of bird)and a chicken. it ENDS with the little girl giving up her pet at last, and letting it live in the wild, but Andre still returns. He made 24 trips home. :) I loved the movie, and i definitely recommend watching it. Spoiler time... It comes time in the movie that Toni finds out by mistake that the seal is going to be taken back, to the wild. You see her in bed that night, saying good night to her mom, and crying, exclaiming "he's my best friend. we're best friends." you may find it odd that she would say this, but Toni is shy, and she doesn't have very many friends. I wouldn't say she's shy, as does the movie reviews on the back of the case... but... well, you'll see what i mean when you watch the movie yourself. Keep in mind that this story is about a fourth-grader, not a four-year-old, yet this little girl doesn't seem to have ever been separated or had a sleep over, or anything. Until along comes Andre, an orphaned seal. How was he orphaned? you'll see when you watch the movie. I highly recommend seeing the movie. it's one that isn't just for young, but old people too. :) i promise, you'll love it. *Another Little Note* FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DO NOT REALIZE IT, THIS MOVIE CANNOT, AND I REPEAT, CANNOT!!! BE A RIP OFF of *ANY* MOVIE!!!! IT'S A TRUE STORY FOR CRIPES SAKE!!! YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT HAS REALLY HAPPENED, ALL YOU CAN DO IS MAKE SOMETHING OF IT!!!!! SHEESH!

    A seal befriends a young girl (Tina Majorino) and her family (led by parents Keith Carradine and Chelsea Field) in 1962 Maine in this true story that will be loved by most of the kiddies, but adults will not find much interest. This odd little flick by director George Miller (not the same man known for the "Mad Max" and "Babe" set of series) seems to have little aspirations. It is satisfied with strange and silly situations rather than potentially going a more dramatic route. The screenplay is sophomoric and the actors seem clearly aware of that fact and what we are left with is a seal on the land doing its best to act as dumb as its human co-stars. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

    ANDRE, in my opinion, is a very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the tricks that Willy did. If I could have, I would have helped hide him myself. The only problem is how I would hide him, though. The score was good, the costumes were perfectly designed, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.

    If you have never seen a movie about children and animals, you might really like this one. But if you've seen more than three or four of them, you'll probably feel this is a compilation of them. It's hard to believe that so many clich&eacute;s could be put in one single movie. If you show it to your (younger) children they'll probably have a good time. If you don't expect much from it, you may join them. But if you skip some scenes, don't bother: you've surely seen them before. And if you want to see a family with a seal I'd strongly suggest "A Summer with Selik", a Norwegian 3-episode serial where fisherman struggle against nature and not against each other, and a family teaches a orphan seal to swim, catch a fish and survive, and not to play with a ball or pose in front of TV cameras. Although, you may have trouble to find it (I haven't even found it on IMDb!) ** some spoilers ** Though most of the scenes are predictable, some are rather funny and watchable till film tries to become dramatic. A seal rescuing a little girl in a small boat from a stormy sea, and then the boat sinking at the very moment when her father appears after hours of searching, destroy last hope that this movie could stay on the average level of a family movie. Keith Carradine can't be bad if he has a role to act. In this films he reminds me on those tennis-stars who come to small tournaments just to appear and lose in 1st round, only to give some attention and dignity to local competition. Not the "avoid in any circumstance" movie, but every scene in it has already been made in some other (usually better) movies.

    Hi, I'm Camille Bajema reporting for KIDS FIRST! and today I'm reviewing the 1994 film "Andre," based on the book "A Seal Called Andre" which is based on a true story. I like this film because I'm an animal lover and this film is filled with animals. "Andre" is about a little girl, Toni Whitney, played by Tina Majorina, who lives with her parents Harry and Thalice, played by Shane Meier and Chelsea Field; her sister, Paula, played by Aidan Pendleton; and her brother Steve, played by Keith Carradine. They have an assortment of animals, and decide to adopt an orphaned, baby seal that that they name Andre. Andre lives with the Whitney's for a few years, until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take Andre away! My favorite character in this film is Toni's mother, Thalice. I like Thalice because she is very loving toward her kids, yet also knows how to discipline them. My favorite scene in this movie is when Andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier. I like this scene because Andre is so cute and fun. An interesting fact is that Andre is played by a sea lion, not a seal, in the movie. "Andre" is directed by George Miller and produced by Annette Handley. The music in this film sets the mood. The movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in Rockport, Maine and I especially love the cinematography when the seasons change. This movie is a tear-jerker and Toni learns that despite how much she loves Andre she may have to let him go. This is a family-friendly movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. I give this film five-out-of- five stars because I thought that the movie was really well-done overall and had a great plot. I am pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much because the picture on the cover made me think that it would appeal to a younger audience.

    There's really no need to go much in depth into this movie. It based on the true story of Andre the seal, a harbour seal rescued as a pup after losing his mother and raised by a human family in Rockport, Maine. It's basically the story of his interactions with the family, and with the variety of other animals that the family had in their home. There's a little bit of human drama involved, but mostly it's the story of Andre, and especially his relationship with young Toni (Tina Majorino), the youngest daughter of the family who develops a special bond with Andre, who eventually ends up spending his winters in the Boston Aquarium and then returns to the family in Rockport every year until he dies of old age 24 years later. The story is basically told from Toni's perspective. It's a fine family film. Most of the cast aren't especially well known, but that's fine, because the star of the movie is really Andre. It's a movie you can sit down and watch with your kids for an enjoyable evening at home. Nothing more than that - but sometimes that's quite enough. (7/10)

    Andre is a very sweet type of film, maybe too sickly sweet, but it is very nice and endearing. There are some slow moments in the middling half and some of the writing gets a tad mawkish. That said, the acting is fine, Tina Majorino is really good as the animal-loving daughter who befriends the seal, and it was really nice to see Keith Carradine in a somewhat atypical role as he portrayed the most likable human character. The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery is magical and the music is lovely. What makes Andre though is the seal Andre, played in real-life by a sea-lion. Andre is one lovable character, he is so cute, endearing and funny. His scenes with Majorino were very touching, and he just steals the film from everybody else with effortless ease. Overall, a very sweet but enjoyable family fare, and I just want to add I noticed no rip-off of anything, then again I am not as observant as some people. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    This is probably my favorite movie ever. Its amazing.. i've probably seen it at least 50 times. It's a great movie for the whole family and I promise anyone who sees it will love it. You will want to watch it over and over again, one time is not enough. Three times is really not enough. The story of a seal and the family who takes him in is amazing, all of the details which are added make it even better. All of the characters are interesting. The movie will make you laugh and cry, but you'l'l be smiling all the way through. It makes you want to find a seal of your own, if thats possible. The characters are people you will want to meet, if not for their great personality then for your own amusement. When I have children, I will show them this movie at least as many times as I have seen it. You should watch this movie- it's my absolute favorite and you will definitely love it.

    The Good & Bad Of 'Andre'

    GOOD - What gave this movie appeal and made it a bit different is that a seal is the star. The likable seal, "Andre," (in real life, Tory, the sea lion) has cute face with big brown eyes and likes to stick his tongue out and give everyone "the raspberry." The latter joke is way overdone, but it's okay. The most likable human is the father, played by Keith Carradine. The kids are somewhat spoiled but the little one, the star (Tina Majorino) isn't bad. THE BAD - Too much typical Hollywood families in which (1) there is a stupid teen romance with a rebellious, pouting female teen; (2) the nasty foe who makes trouble for no apparent reason; (3) the nice-guy husband who gets unfairly blamed or is proved wrong in family affairs (the Liberal mother always winning out). OVERALL - A little more of the seal and less of the teen girls and other annoying people would have made this a lot better. As it is, one viewing was enough.

    It was only when I saw the credits, I then understand it's based on a true story. It made me smile even more. So I guessed I knew why I saw this few days back for a reason. The trailers had won me over and when I saw the movie itself, it was just so heart-warming. Toni's attachment to Andre is one maybe I can sort of relate to. Sentimental attachment to something where one have feeling for after sometime. Throw in a bit of drama as well, and one can see how Toni reacts especially to how others who don't really like Andre's sudden popularity in the town. This is just one of those where the family can all enjoy it together. Sometimes we just need a bit of old-fashioned goodness. Quite a heart-warming movie.

    Well, yes, this movie was probably the best kid's movie i've seen in a long time. couple of swears, and it WASN'T a rip off of Free Willy. Free Willy was a rip off of Andre. How do i know? Because this movie is based on a true story. Willy isn't. The movie starts with a young girl marrying off a sparrow (or some kind of bird)and a chicken. it ENDS with the little girl giving up her pet at last, and letting it live in the wild, but Andre still returns. He made 24 trips home. :) I loved the movie, and i definitely recommend watching it. Spoiler time... It comes time in the movie that Toni finds out by mistake that the seal is going to be taken back, to the wild. You see her in bed that night, saying good night to her mom, and crying, exclaiming "he's my best friend. we're best friends." you may find it odd that she would say this, but Toni is shy, and she doesn't have very many friends. I wouldn't say she's shy, as does the movie reviews on the back of the case... but... well, you'll see what i mean when you watch the movie yourself. Keep in mind that this story is about a fourth-grader, not a four-year-old, yet this little girl doesn't seem to have ever been separated or had a sleep over, or anything. Until along comes Andre, an orphaned seal. How was he orphaned? you'll see when you watch the movie. I highly recommend seeing the movie. it's one that isn't just for young, but old people too. :) i promise, you'll love it. *Another Little Note* FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DO NOT REALIZE IT, THIS MOVIE CANNOT, AND I REPEAT, CANNOT!!! BE A RIP OFF of *ANY* MOVIE!!!! IT'S A TRUE STORY FOR CRIPES SAKE!!! YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT HAS REALLY HAPPENED, ALL YOU CAN DO IS MAKE SOMETHING OF IT!!!!! SHEESH!

    A seal befriends a young girl (Tina Majorino) and her family (led by parents Keith Carradine and Chelsea Field) in 1962 Maine in this true story that will be loved by most of the kiddies, but adults will not find much interest. This odd little flick by director George Miller (not the same man known for the "Mad Max" and "Babe" set of series) seems to have little aspirations. It is satisfied with strange and silly situations rather than potentially going a more dramatic route. The screenplay is sophomoric and the actors seem clearly aware of that fact and what we are left with is a seal on the land doing its best to act as dumb as its human co-stars. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

    ANDRE, in my opinion, is a very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the tricks that Willy did. If I could have, I would have helped hide him myself. The only problem is how I would hide him, though. The score was good, the costumes were perfectly designed, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.

    If you have never seen a movie about children and animals, you might really like this one. But if you've seen more than three or four of them, you'll probably feel this is a compilation of them. It's hard to believe that so many clich&eacute;s could be put in one single movie. If you show it to your (younger) children they'll probably have a good time. If you don't expect much from it, you may join them. But if you skip some scenes, don't bother: you've surely seen them before. And if you want to see a family with a seal I'd strongly suggest "A Summer with Selik", a Norwegian 3-episode serial where fisherman struggle against nature and not against each other, and a family teaches a orphan seal to swim, catch a fish and survive, and not to play with a ball or pose in front of TV cameras. Although, you may have trouble to find it (I haven't even found it on IMDb!) ** some spoilers ** Though most of the scenes are predictable, some are rather funny and watchable till film tries to become dramatic. A seal rescuing a little girl in a small boat from a stormy sea, and then the boat sinking at the very moment when her father appears after hours of searching, destroy last hope that this movie could stay on the average level of a family movie. Keith Carradine can't be bad if he has a role to act. In this films he reminds me on those tennis-stars who come to small tournaments just to appear and lose in 1st round, only to give some attention and dignity to local competition. Not the "avoid in any circumstance" movie, but every scene in it has already been made in some other (usually better) movies.
