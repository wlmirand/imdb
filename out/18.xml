 <sinopse>
  Several people try to take advantage of a little girl's innocence to hustle money her mom gave to her to buy a goldfish with.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Razieh wants a fat goldfish for the Iranian New Years celebration instead of the skinny ones in her family's pond at home, because the fat fish looks like it's dancing when it swims. After many attempts she and her brother convince their mother to give them her last bit of money. Between their home and the fish store, Razieh loses the money.. She finds it, but it is temptingly just out of her reach.

    Snake charmer: "You never take back what you've given! Your money is gone." After seeing Offside (2006), I decided to see more of Jafar Panahi and out of the three films I decided to see, The White Balloon is the first one. The White Balloon takes place on New Year's eve. Seven year old Razieh is sad because she saw beautiful gold fishes in a pet shop but her mother won't let her have any because they have a pond with gold fish already. It is a tradition to have a gold fish for New Year's and after discussing it with her brother, Ali - who is a few years older than Razieh - she manages to convince their mother to give them the money to buy a goldfish in exchange for a balloon that she received. Happy and with a 500 torans note in her fish bowl, Razieh heads out to the pet shop. However, many obstacles and just as many characters will find themselves on her road to the sought out gold fish. This film narrates one of the simplest stories in a sweet way. On many occasions it reminded me of Children of Heaven (1997) - the simple story, the struggles of children and the pervasive themes of money, poverty, the crowded streets of Tehran and of course, all of this centering around a fantastic child actress, Aida Mohammadkhani. It was really heartwarming to see this little child try and convince adults that this money is life and death for her. The way she has to impose herself because adults won't listen to a child is truly moving. Her issues are varied: the multiple attempts she makes to procure the money but also the genuine help she receives from strangers, a notion that is discussed when a soldier argues with her about the notion of what being a "stranger" really is. There are a lot of things that we the viewers are never told, but this didn't concern us, we were too focused on the journey with the 500 torans to care anyway. The movie walks a fine line between the absurd and realism while exploring the edges and angles of social interactions. In no overt way political (unlike the other movies from Panahi can be) it is a very straight forward tale. We are pleasantly reminded that it doesn't take a billion dollar budget to film a good movie. On the other hand, the movie arouses our fears at the outset, without actually fulfilling them. We, as adult viewers, are afraid that Razieh will get hurt or robbed at any moment and when we realize our fears were unfounded it makes us wonder about this misanthropic fear we have of other human beings who we class as "strangers". Maybe we've been fooled too many times and we are wary of the innocence children can have. The movie could have explored more avenues - explore their family, for example, or had music and perhaps more landscape shots - nevertheless, those would all have been decorative. The movie remains at heart as the story it tells, short and poignantly bare. I liked: No unnecessary frills. Razieh is a lovely character. Endearing. Innocence of childhood. I disliked: Maybe some characters were purposely threatening just to provoke a sense of fear in the viewer. 78/100 If you've enjoyed Children of Heaven (1997) I would recommend this to you. If you like stories involving child actors this is a must see. Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com

    I hated this film when I saw it first time. I though that the little girl was a brat. But as I was watching it this time, I realized how unfair that was. She was just a girl. I guess we are so used to watching adorable and cute kids in films, that a selfish kid seems so unlikable. But kids are like that. Selfish and impatient and whining. Once I accepted that I was laughing at her antics. I loved the film but it lost me in the scene, when the girl's brother and the afghan kid fight. I mean there was no reason for that. I think in real life, the brother would have at least asked the afghan kid for the stick and wouldn't have just snatched it. Maybe it was done to evoke a conflict. But even one false scene can break the illusion that is Cinema.

    Firstly the film focuses on children, so your opinions become a little different while watching the film. Because their facial expressions and all are so cute, that you would fail sometimes to notice whether the film is really good or not. The story revolves around a 500 $ note which is given to a girl to buy a fish. However she keeps losing her all the time. People try to take that money from her in different ways but not forcibly. This thing is not portrayed properly. The story of the film is fantastic but I believe that it was not handled properly. Some characters seemed to be inserted forcibly. Also it lacked the child emotions like those present in films like children of heaven. Verdict: "Not necessary to keep in the watch list."

    Assuming you're keeping up-to-date with your current affairs, you'll have heard that the great democracy of Iran yesterday jailed director Jafar Panahi for six years, and forbade him from making movies, going abroad, or giving media interviews for the next twenty years. Allegedly, he had been producing a film critical of the Iranian government; that is, he was calling a spade a spade. As a sort of one-man protest, I decided to watch one of Panahi's movies. 'The White Balloon (1995)' was the director's feature debut, and won the Cam&eacute;ra d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It tells an extremely simple tale, almost in real time: a young girl is given a 500-toman banknote to buy a goldfish for the Iranian New Year. On the way to the market, she loses the money down a sewer grate, and spends the rest of the film trying to get it back, either ignored or aided by the strangers she meets. Putting the plot so simply doesn't really suggest a riveting cinematic experience, but I must say I was taken by the effectiveness of the film. We experience the bustling marketplace through the lens of the young girl, and genuinely share her mixed emotions. This really struck a chord with me. When I was a prep (age 5), I got lost during a school excursion, and I can still recall the dropping of my stomach, the quickened breathing, the welling of tears (don't worry, we got icy poles afterwards!). That's the feeling I got here, particularly when the snake charmer stole the girl's money and claimed it as a "donation." I felt as helpless as she did. Fortunately, the film's overriding emotion is one of optimism. Strangers, seeing a child in distress, stop to offer their assistance. A young Afghan balloon-seller proffers a stick and chewing gum with which to retrieve the out-of-reach money. The girl's brother, a resourceful kid of about age ten, arrives on the scene, and suddenly everything seems like it's going to be OK. Sometimes simple films can be the most enjoyable of all.

    I watched this movie totally by surprise. I found out just one hour before that it was scheduled on TV. It started slowly, maybe too slowly, or maybe too arid, for my taste, to become suddenly so cute, and not only cute, everything on the screen was real time, I was following breathlessly the adventures of the little girl, to find out, exactly at the end, that the movie was about something else. The White Balloon - you get the meaning of the title only in the last scene, after all movie was about getting the money, loosing and then trying to recuperate them to buy a goldfish. This movie is not only deceptive, it has multiple levels of deception. The author of the screenplay is Abbas Kiarostami, and the way it starts looks like a movie by Kiarostami about children (along with grown-ups not understanding the little ones). Where is the Friend's Home comes to mind immediately, only this is beguiling. Here the grown-ups, as estranged from the natural of children as they can be, are eventually willing to help. Also the little girl is not faultless either. Actually she is a pest. Anything bad that comes is due to her only. She is greedy, cunning, desperate, spoiled. That's it. While she is cute. Well, because all kids her age are the same way: greedy, cunning, selfish, desperate, spoiled; a pest, while extremely cute. That's why we love them. Is it then a nice comedy about a cute girl who desires a goldfish? Not exactly, that's just another level of deception. As it comes to the end, we realize the remarkable wholeness of this movie: a close space, just a couple of streets, a very short period of time, just a couple of hours, just a few personages, confined to this small space and time. Each one (not only the girl) is acting somehow frenetically, and the resulting whole is a crazy small universe, absurdly self-sufficient. These people are acting totally unaware of each other, except when it happens to collide; in these particular situations they fight or cooperate, or do the both, then again each one is unaware of others' presence. There is however a boy who's the exception, a stranger (an Afghan immigrant)... but you should watch the movie to get it.

    The White Balloon is a movie which banks upon it's unbelievably simple story and settings. Shot almost entirely in just about three locations within a locality the movie comes across as a beautifully made spectacle of new wave cinema . The Director does well to capture the moments in lens which come from the actors in the movie (almost all of them are children). Natural acting and a delectable plot mark the movie. It is sometimes quite incredible to note how such a beautiful movie comes out of a painfully simple plot, a plot which reminds us of short stories from our primary school days. No scope for melodrama or extravagance Mr. Panahi quite ably illustrates that big budgets , exquisite locations and highly paid actors are not needed to make Exceptional movies. Movie which will stay with you for ever. Simple is Beautiful.

    My neighbor loaned my this film on Video CD format, which made the film somewhat hard to see and the subtitles hard to read because of the low bit rate. The copy I was loaned was apparently from Singapore or Hong Kong. But anyway, to the film. A young girl is given money to satisfy a personal desire for a pet. But during her journey she runs into a cross section of Persian society, each representing a faction or layer of Iranian social strata, and their effect and demands on the young generation, and specifically the unempowered female population. A plethora of individuals are encountered. Whirling dervishes, a young soldier, a shop keeper, a father, a motherly woman who is not the main character's mother, a young brother and many more. We're shown coded forms of communication regarding what each social faction demands and is preoccupies the thoughts and feelings of Iran's natives. I pride myself on being able to decipher such meaty films, but it did take a little bit to decode the inner message, but it's there. Currently, as I write this, Iran's leadership still desires to pursue a nuclear weapon's program and to become a major influence in the Persian Gulf region. Including, but not limited to, assisting the insurgents in Iraq which our forces have fought, and have finally brought under control. Iran's leadership is posturing, but is fighting the aged old social conflict of a moderate middle populace becoming factionalized by misallocated resources. Can Iran continue to focus its domestic lens on the United States as a means of slight of hand to avoid its inner stresses and strains? Time will tell. This film doesn't hold the answer to any of those larger questions, but it does illustrate an interesting pastiche of what forces are pulling on Iran's society, and how half the population remain unimpowered because of a deliberate and manufactured reliance. Otherwise it's a nice little film. A bit slow, well shot, and certainly more than meets the eye. An interesting piece of political commentary disguised as a children's film. Give it a whirl if you like foreign films.

    I've read many other user's comments about this movie and most of them talk about the beautiful story of a Iranian little girl who is very worried for she has lost the money her mother gave to her. Well, the little girl's very cute, indeed, but the story, from my point of view, is far from being that beautiful. First off, the trouble she gets involved is all her fault. She just doesn't follow her mother's advices/orders like passing by a "dangerous" place or talking with strangers. Second, all she can do is cry and wait for others to solve the problem she caused by herself. Third, she's not capable of saying at least a small "Thank you" when everything becomes fine for her. Is this beautiful? I don't think so. Alright, you can say that she's so young and innocence is all she's got, so let's give her a little chance here. Now, what can you tell me about her brother? It's very obvious that he's a way more clever and, let's say it this way, more experienced than the little girl. He's always concerned about her little sister's well-being and that's great, but this is something that most of the brothers around the world do, so there's no need to say that his actions are "beautiful". And on the other hand, the way he treats the Afghani kid is not kind at all. First, by rudely taking his stick and then (here I go again), by not saying a little "Thank you" to him even when the Afghani kid bought with his own money the chewing gum and then let the Iranian ones use his stick, just to help the little girl... All the Afghani kid gets is loneliness when the new year comes... is this beautiful? I clearly understand that the movie is a big metaphor about trying to help each other and being able to show gratitude. And I stick myself to this meaning for the movie didn't leave me a "beautiful" feeling for one way or another, the grown-ups tried to help the little girl in their very own way, so there's not such an adult indifference here. But when another kid really helps them out, all he gets is the indifference that most of the viewers thought the sister and brother were suffering. Anyway, and now talking about the movie in a general way, I think that the Director could save at least 20 minutes of film by avoiding some long and useless scenes. For example, the one where the kid brings soap instead of shampoo; all the repetitive dialogues the little girls has as well as the long and boring one when the old man explains to his friends why he was arguing with a client. This extra-material makes the movie a little bit slow and, sometimes, boring. That's why I give this 7 out of ten stars.

    It was my big sister's turn to pick a film to go to when we were gorging ourselves in what the Reykjavik cinema festival had to offer back in the days. Didn't expect anything but mushy boredom for an hour and a half. Instead of the sentimental torture I had braced myself for, I became spellbound by this beautiful story that totally held me captivated right from the beginning to the end. The little girl, Aida who plays the protagonist, was ever so sincere and true in her role that you forgot you were watching a film, and even I felt a couple of masculine tears running down my cheeks. The White Balloon is simply a gorgeous film and it's out of the blue quirky humor elevates it even further. Even with the wet towel slap in the end, I truly loved the whole of this Persian confect buffet down to it's last bit, ... and still do!

    I just watched this film, and after reading all the comments about it, I'm frustrated overall. Like one of the previous comments said. This movie is all about metaphors. That is the most obvious things about Iranian film. To have anyone say that this movie had no point and that the title made no sense is annoying. There are several things to be taken from this movie. First of all it is a realistic glimpse of Iranian daily life. Its not pretty and scenic as in other Iranian films. There were so many people who were concerned about their own needs over the girl's money, who by the way was a complete brat. However you should take note that despite their incompentence or lack of concern for the girl, each attempted to help her out, albeit often grudgingly. It is important to understand why the Afghani boy was freezed upon. This could be a class/cultural/social issue. First of all these middle class children were ungrateful and ran off as soon as they got their money. 2nd, the tensions between Afghani and Iranians have been notable as you can probably see in films such as Baran. 3rd this is about the human nature of looking out for yourself over everything else. Once the children got what they wanted, everything else doesn't matter. The white balloon was the only balloon not purchased. It was alone in the end just like the Afghani boy.

    Snake charmer: "You never take back what you've given! Your money is gone." After seeing Offside (2006), I decided to see more of Jafar Panahi and out of the three films I decided to see, The White Balloon is the first one. The White Balloon takes place on New Year's eve. Seven year old Razieh is sad because she saw beautiful gold fishes in a pet shop but her mother won't let her have any because they have a pond with gold fish already. It is a tradition to have a gold fish for New Year's and after discussing it with her brother, Ali - who is a few years older than Razieh - she manages to convince their mother to give them the money to buy a goldfish in exchange for a balloon that she received. Happy and with a 500 torans note in her fish bowl, Razieh heads out to the pet shop. However, many obstacles and just as many characters will find themselves on her road to the sought out gold fish. This film narrates one of the simplest stories in a sweet way. On many occasions it reminded me of Children of Heaven (1997) - the simple story, the struggles of children and the pervasive themes of money, poverty, the crowded streets of Tehran and of course, all of this centering around a fantastic child actress, Aida Mohammadkhani. It was really heartwarming to see this little child try and convince adults that this money is life and death for her. The way she has to impose herself because adults won't listen to a child is truly moving. Her issues are varied: the multiple attempts she makes to procure the money but also the genuine help she receives from strangers, a notion that is discussed when a soldier argues with her about the notion of what being a "stranger" really is.

    The White Balloon is a movie which banks upon it's unbelievably simple story and settings. Shot almost entirely in just about three locations within a locality the movie comes across as a beautifully made spectacle of new wave cinema . The Director does well to capture the moments in lens which come from the actors in the movie (almost all of them are children). Natural acting and a delectable plot mark the movie. It is sometimes quite incredible to note how such a beautiful movie comes out of a painfully simple plot, a plot which reminds us of short stories from our primary school days. No scope for melodrama or extravagance Mr. Panahi quite ably illustrates that big budgets , exquisite locations and highly paid actors are not needed to make Exceptional movies. Movie which will stay with you for ever. Simple is Beautiful.

    My neighbor loaned my this film on Video CD format, which made the film somewhat hard to see and the subtitles hard to read because of the low bit rate. The copy I was loaned was apparently from Singapore or Hong Kong. But anyway, to the film. A young girl is given money to satisfy a personal desire for a pet. But during her journey she runs into a cross section of Persian society, each representing a faction or layer of Iranian social strata, and their effect and demands on the young generation, and specifically the unempowered female population. A plethora of individuals are encountered. Whirling dervishes, a young soldier, a shop keeper, a father, a motherly woman who is not the main character's mother, a young brother and many more. We're shown coded forms of communication regarding what each social faction demands and is preoccupies the thoughts and feelings of Iran's natives. I pride myself on being able to decipher such meaty films, but it did take a little bit to decode the inner message, but it's there. Currently, as I write this, Iran's leadership still desires to pursue a nuclear weapon's program and to become a major influence in the Persian Gulf region. Including, but not limited to, assisting the insurgents in Iraq which our forces have fought, and have finally brought under control. Iran's leadership is posturing, but is fighting the aged old social conflict of a moderate middle populace becoming factionalized by misallocated resources. Can Iran continue to focus its domestic lens on the United States as a means of slight of hand to avoid its inner stresses and strains? Time will tell. This film doesn't hold the answer to any of those larger questions, but it does illustrate an interesting pastiche of what forces are pulling on Iran's society, and how half the population remain unimpowered because of a deliberate and manufactured reliance. Otherwise it's a nice little film. A bit slow, well shot, and certainly more than meets the eye. An interesting piece of political commentary disguised as a children's film. Give it a whirl if you like foreign films.

    I've read many other user's comments about this movie and most of them talk about the beautiful story of a Iranian little girl who is very worried for she has lost the money her mother gave to her. Well, the little girl's very cute, indeed, but the story, from my point of view, is far from being that beautiful. First off, the trouble she gets involved is all her fault. She just doesn't follow her mother's advices/orders like passing by a "dangerous" place or talking with strangers. Second, all she can do is cry and wait for others to solve the problem she caused by herself. Third, she's not capable of saying at least a small "Thank you" when everything becomes fine for her. Is this beautiful? I don't think so. Alright, you can say that she's so young and innocence is all she's got, so let's give her a little chance here. Now, what can you tell me about her brother? It's very obvious that he's a way more clever and, let's say it this way, more experienced than the little girl. He's always concerned about her little sister's well-being and that's great, but this is something that most of the brothers around the world do, so there's no need to say that his actions are "beautiful". And on the other hand, the way he treats the Afghani kid is not kind at all. First, by rudely taking his stick and then (here I go again), by not saying a little "Thank you" to him even when the Afghani kid bought with his own money the chewing gum and then let the Iranian ones use his stick, just to help the little girl... All the Afghani kid gets is loneliness when the new year comes... is this beautiful? I clearly understand that the movie is a big metaphor about trying to help each other and being able to show gratitude. And I stick myself to this meaning for the movie didn't leave me a "beautiful" feeling for one way or another, the grown-ups tried to help the little girl in their very own way, so there's not such an adult indifference here. But when another kid really helps them out, all he gets is the indifference that most of the viewers thought the sister and brother were suffering. Anyway, and now talking about the movie in a general way, I think that the Director could save at least 20 minutes of film by avoiding some long and useless scenes. For example, the one where the kid brings soap instead of shampoo; all the repetitive dialogues the little girls has as well as the long and boring one when the old man explains to his friends why he was arguing with a client. This extra-material makes the movie a little bit slow and, sometimes, boring. That's why I give this 7 out of ten stars.

    It was my big sister's turn to pick a film to go to when we were gorging ourselves in what the Reykjavik cinema festival had to offer back in the days. Didn't expect anything but mushy boredom for an hour and a half. Instead of the sentimental torture I had braced myself for, I became spellbound by this beautiful story that totally held me captivated right from the beginning to the end. The little girl, Aida who plays the protagonist, was ever so sincere and true in her role that you forgot you were watching a film, and even I felt a couple of masculine tears running down my cheeks. The White Balloon is simply a gorgeous film and it's out of the blue quirky humor elevates it even further. Even with the wet towel slap in the end, I truly loved the whole of this Persian confect buffet down to it's last bit, ... and still do!

    I just watched this film, and after reading all the comments about it, I'm frustrated overall. Like one of the previous comments said. This movie is all about metaphors. That is the most obvious things about Iranian film. To have anyone say that this movie had no point and that the title made no sense is annoying. There are several things to be taken from this movie. First of all it is a realistic glimpse of Iranian daily life. Its not pretty and scenic as in other Iranian films. There were so many people who were concerned about their own needs over the girl's money, who by the way was a complete brat. However you should take note that despite their incompentence or lack of concern for the girl, each attempted to help her out, albeit often grudgingly. It is important to understand why the Afghani boy was freezed upon. This could be a class/cultural/social issue. First of all these middle class children were ungrateful and ran off as soon as they got their money. 2nd, the tensions between Afghani and Iranians have been notable as you can probably see in films such as Baran. 3rd this is about the human nature of looking out for yourself over everything else. Once the children got what they wanted, everything else doesn't matter. The white balloon was the only balloon not purchased. It was alone in the end just like the Afghani boy.

    Snake charmer: "You never take back what you've given! Your money is gone." After seeing Offside (2006), I decided to see more of Jafar Panahi and out of the three films I decided to see, The White Balloon is the first one. The White Balloon takes place on New Year's eve. Seven year old Razieh is sad because she saw beautiful gold fishes in a pet shop but her mother won't let her have any because they have a pond with gold fish already. It is a tradition to have a gold fish for New Year's and after discussing it with her brother, Ali - who is a few years older than Razieh - she manages to convince their mother to give them the money to buy a goldfish in exchange for a balloon that she received. Happy and with a 500 torans note in her fish bowl, Razieh heads out to the pet shop. However, many obstacles and just as many characters will find themselves on her road to the sought out gold fish. This film narrates one of the simplest stories in a sweet way. On many occasions it reminded me of Children of Heaven (1997) - the simple story, the struggles of children and the pervasive themes of money, poverty, the crowded streets of Tehran and of course, all of this centering around a fantastic child actress, Aida Mohammadkhani. It was really heartwarming to see this little child try and convince adults that this money is life and death for her. The way she has to impose herself because adults won't listen to a child is truly moving. Her issues are varied: the multiple attempts she makes to procure the money but also the genuine help she receives from strangers, a notion that is discussed when a soldier argues with her about the notion of what being a "stranger" really is. There are a lot of things that we the viewers are never told, but this didn't concern us, we were too focused on the journey with the 500 torans to care anyway. The movie walks a fine line between the absurd and realism while exploring the edges and angles of social interactions. In no overt way political (unlike the other movies from Panahi can be) it is a very straight forward tale. We are pleasantly reminded that it doesn't take a billion dollar budget to film a good movie. On the other hand, the movie arouses our fears at the outset, without actually fulfilling them. We, as adult viewers, are afraid that Razieh will get hurt or robbed at any moment and when we realize our fears were unfounded it makes us wonder about this misanthropic fear we have of other human beings who we class as "strangers". Maybe we've been fooled too many times and we are wary of the innocence children can have. The movie could have explored more avenues - explore their family, for example, or had music and perhaps more landscape shots - nevertheless, those would all have been decorative. The movie remains at heart as the story it tells, short and poignantly bare. I liked: No unnecessary frills. Razieh is a lovely character. Endearing. Innocence of childhood. I disliked: Maybe some characters were purposely threatening just to provoke a sense of fear in the viewer. 78/100 If you've enjoyed Children of Heaven (1997) I would recommend this to you. If you like stories involving child actors this is a must see. Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com

    I hated this film when I saw it first time. I though that the little girl was a brat. But as I was watching it this time, I realized how unfair that was. She was just a girl. I guess we are so used to watching adorable and cute kids in films, that a selfish kid seems so unlikable. But kids are like that. Selfish and impatient and whining. Once I accepted that I was laughing at her antics. I loved the film but it lost me in the scene, when the girl's brother and the afghan kid fight. I mean there was no reason for that. I think in real life, the brother would have at least asked the afghan kid for the stick and wouldn't have just snatched it. Maybe it was done to evoke a conflict. But even one false scene can break the illusion that is Cinema.

    Firstly the film focuses on children, so your opinions become a little different while watching the film. Because their facial expressions and all are so cute, that you would fail sometimes to notice whether the film is really good or not. The story revolves around a 500 $ note which is given to a girl to buy a fish. However she keeps losing her all the time. People try to take that money from her in different ways but not forcibly. This thing is not portrayed properly. The story of the film is fantastic but I believe that it was not handled properly. Some characters seemed to be inserted forcibly. Also it lacked the child emotions like those present in films like children of heaven. Verdict: "Not necessary to keep in the watch list."

    Assuming you're keeping up-to-date with your current affairs, you'll have heard that the great democracy of Iran yesterday jailed director Jafar Panahi for six years, and forbade him from making movies, going abroad, or giving media interviews for the next twenty years. Allegedly, he had been producing a film critical of the Iranian government; that is, he was calling a spade a spade. As a sort of one-man protest, I decided to watch one of Panahi's movies. 'The White Balloon (1995)' was the director's feature debut, and won the Cam&eacute;ra d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It tells an extremely simple tale, almost in real time: a young girl is given a 500-toman banknote to buy a goldfish for the Iranian New Year. On the way to the market, she loses the money down a sewer grate, and spends the rest of the film trying to get it back, either ignored or aided by the strangers she meets. Putting the plot so simply doesn't really suggest a riveting cinematic experience, but I must say I was taken by the effectiveness of the film. We experience the bustling marketplace through the lens of the young girl, and genuinely share her mixed emotions. This really struck a chord with me. When I was a prep (age 5), I got lost during a school excursion, and I can still recall the dropping of my stomach, the quickened breathing, the welling of tears (don't worry, we got icy poles afterwards!). That's the feeling I got here, particularly when the snake charmer stole the girl's money and claimed it as a "donation." I felt as helpless as she did. Fortunately, the film's overriding emotion is one of optimism. Strangers, seeing a child in distress, stop to offer their assistance. A young Afghan balloon-seller proffers a stick and chewing gum with which to retrieve the out-of-reach money. The girl's brother, a resourceful kid of about age ten, arrives on the scene, and suddenly everything seems like it's going to be OK. Sometimes simple films can be the most enjoyable of all.

    I watched this movie totally by surprise. I found out just one hour before that it was scheduled on TV. It started slowly, maybe too slowly, or maybe too arid, for my taste, to become suddenly so cute, and not only cute, everything on the screen was real time, I was following breathlessly the adventures of the little girl, to find out, exactly at the end, that the movie was about something else. The White Balloon - you get the meaning of the title only in the last scene, after all movie was about getting the money, loosing and then trying to recuperate them to buy a goldfish. This movie is not only deceptive, it has multiple levels of deception. The author of the screenplay is Abbas Kiarostami, and the way it starts looks like a movie by Kiarostami about children (along with grown-ups not understanding the little ones). Where is the Friend's Home comes to mind immediately, only this is beguiling. Here the grown-ups, as estranged from the natural of children as they can be, are eventually willing to help. Also the little girl is not faultless either. Actually she is a pest. Anything bad that comes is due to her only. She is greedy, cunning, desperate, spoiled. That's it. While she is cute. Well, because all kids her age are the same way: greedy, cunning, selfish, desperate, spoiled; a pest, while extremely cute. That's why we love them. Is it then a nice comedy about a cute girl who desires a goldfish? Not exactly, that's just another level of deception. As it comes to the end, we realize the remarkable wholeness of this movie: a close space, just a couple of streets, a very short period of time, just a couple of hours, just a few personages, confined to this small space and time. Each one (not only the girl) is acting somehow frenetically, and the resulting whole is a crazy small universe, absurdly self-sufficient. These people are acting totally unaware of each other, except when it happens to collide; in these particular situations they fight or cooperate, or do the both, then again each one is unaware of others' presence. There is however a boy who's the exception, a stranger (an Afghan immigrant)... but you should watch the movie to get it.
