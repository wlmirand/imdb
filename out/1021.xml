    8&frac12; is my first film from Frederico Fellini and while I can't say I really liked it, there are many aspects I appreciated here. It's interesting how Fellini makes you feel like you're inside this troubled filmmaker's mind, constantly intercalating flashbacks of his memories with his fantasies and reality. Essentially, the story is about Guido, a famous director who suffers from a creative block and is unable to come up with new ideas for his upcoming film. However, it's so much deeper than that as he retreats to his dreams and memories, hoping to get inspired while also having to cope with personal struggles and the absurd amount of pressure from the cast and crew. I liked how vibrant the characters were at times and the camera work here is simply astounding. The opening dream sequence was very innovative and the way Fellini introduces each character, making Guido interact with so many of them at the same time was excellent. I was also surprised by how funny some of these encounters got (mainly in the first half of the film). While I appreciate the surrealism and strangeness here, I felt that some characters weren't particularly interesting and some sequences were a bit too extended so I wasn't very engaged with the story on certain occasions. Still, 8&frac12; is a fascinating and insightful work of art and certainly worth seeing by any film enthusiast.

    Directors generally see things around and write scripts. But Fellini dreams and with his movie he takes you to a place where you could never be. In the movie, he ultimately transforms a dream like sequence to reality and its such a wonder. Compared to other Fellini's movies like Satyricon this is straight-forward but I still recommend viewing it number of times to appreciate the magic of Fellini. Certain characters are nothing but projection at the protagonist's mind. While few others are one and same. The BGM is fantastic (mostly from Western classical) and did I mention the famous "Harem scene". There is a mid-aged prostitute shown too scary in the movie as Fellini is known to show women in beautiful yet scary way. This semi-autobiographical movie is impossible to rate so beyond 10/10.

    There are movies and movies. Many movies are "just movies", that is, perfectly ordinary, undistinguish movies. Many are bad. Many are okay. Some are great. Some are unusual. "8&frac12;" (in Italian, 'Otto e mezzo') might just be one of those special cases. It is a brain teaser because it's spectacularly confusing. It is a jigsaw puzzle because it's extremely complex. It isn't one of those movies which you can say &laquo;Eureka! I got it!&raquo; at first, perhaps not even on a 16th or a 22nd viewing. It is possible to understand it better (more or less) with time and subsequent viewings. But it requires attention and patience, not only for being such a complicated film but also because it's a long one (2 hours and 10 minutes). Definitely not a film for people who are lazy to (or simply don't like to) burn their brains thinking. This is not an easy film to evaluate. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not when I first saw it. Meanwhile I've come to realize that I like it. It burns my brain yet I like that about it. It obliges me to reflect and to disclose its mysteries. The story is very strange and intriguing: Guido, a film director, is going through a crisis Â– to be more precise, he is suffering from "director's block". He feels trapped while doing his latest film and his personal life isn't doing much better. Flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies, often shaping up with reality. As a result, it's almost impossible for the viewer(s) to distinguish reality from fiction. This brilliant concept was much later used in the great Spanish film "Abre los ojos" (1997). Attention, that I mean only the concept of being unable to tell reality from fiction. "8&frac12;" seems to be unanimously considered Federico Fellini's best. It's a highly influential movie in many ways. In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed, the videoclip of the wonderful song "Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M., is more than just a wee bit inspired by the traffic jam in the opening dream sequence of Fellini's "8&frac12;". And this in 1993, exactly 30 years later. Marcello Mastroianni is great as Guido. The gorgeous Claudia Cardinale does a great acting as Claudia (whom Guido casts as a movie star that represents his ideal of a woman). The use of music deserves a word or two from me. There is a musical score by Nino Rota, but the classical music draws the attention as well, such as the noted "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner and, best of all, cream of the crop, tip of the top, the glorious "The Barber of Seville (Overture)" by Gioachino Rossini. This Italian piece of classical music is an underrated and often forgotten masterpiece and it was also used in one episode of "Tom and Jerry" before and much later in 1978 in the Italian TV commercial "Lancio Citro&euml;n Visa", a wonderful 10- minute long video about that very nice French car made at the time it was launched to the market. In conclusion, "8&frac12;" is a towering achievement and one of the great italians. Title in Portugal: "Fellini Oito e Meio".

    A director is supposed to be working on a big-budget film that is part science fiction, part autobiography, but he becomes obsessed with the process of casting actresses to portray the various women in his life: his wife, his mistresses, his first crush, women he passed on the street, and finally even the actresses who represent these women. This is a lengthy, often-abstract, but usually-coherent reflection of the director's conflicted attitudes and desires. Through fantasy sequences it displays the character's private thoughts and memories with disarming honesty and a fair amount of humor. Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York" (2008) could almost be said to be a remake of "8 1/2," or at least a very similar rumination on very similar ideas.

    I don't want to write a review. I just want to dedicate a few words to the greatest film of all time. Along with 'Last Year At Marienbad' this would be discussed and dissected even after a thousand years. People then, would also stand in awe. Tears of joy will roll down their cheeks. Art is immortal. And this is the highest point of art. Exactly 50 years ago, 8&frac12; was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. 50 years have gone by. A 1000 more will pass by, but the most exciting, ethereal, magical, exhilarating, brilliant, astounding piece of art, ever created on celluloid, will remain immortal. My favourite film of all time. Il Maestro and Marcello and Rota will live on forever. So will 'Asa Nisi Masa' and 'Saraghina'. And we'll hold hands and dance to the ending tune till eternity. Here's raising a toast to the film where the law of diminishing marginal utility doesn't apply :) Cinema is 8&frac12;

    On the surface, the story may seem straightforward if you read a synopsis of "8&frac12;," but once you actually watch this movie, it will seem like a convoluted mess that makes no sense. Heck, I found myself getting irritated trying to make sense of what is going on until I realized that this film is actually taking place inside of the main character's head, which means its filled with dreamlike fantasies which range from relationship issues and his childhood which seem to seep into his thoughts as he goes through the pressures of writer's block, coupled with the pressure from the public eye in trying to create a new film. I was expecting not to like this film at all, but unexpectedly I began to see something special about as I was watching this. This movie has a certain feeling to it that is different than a lot of movies. Sure the story may not be good as every other classic. Sure the story may not be dark and brooding. Sure the movie may seem redundant at times. The thing that I love is how the film presents itself. I was trying to figure out how to comprehend what's going on the same way I try to comprehend my own dreams. What I got from this is that it is a story of one's own confusion and the struggle to find clarity in a life where everyone is in your face. It's convoluted to the point where you sometimes cannot tell the transitions from dream to reality. Some are more distinct than others, but the beauty of it all is the beautiful cinematography that gives a strange atmosphere somehow throughout the film with unfamiliar settings and strange situations that is sometimes nonsensical. This is a very unique movie that is so idiosyncratic in its style and it's one of my favorite movies that I have seen and still want to see again.

    Patience and concentration is utmost necessary if you want to see this film. The film tries to depict the block situation of a director. The protagonist is not able to conceive a film and is also suffering from his haunting past. What he wanted to show was a type of abstract film and he had to struggle with the finances. PROS: The film at sometimes becomes very much interesting and makes me remember the truffaut's masterpiece Â– 'Day for night'. One thing was sure, the director in the film was confused about his film and what he was doing and thinking was also confusing. CONS: The film has opening and some sequences confusing. It became difficult to figure out when he was dreaming and when they were shooting. VERDICT: "For mature audience."

    While I was watching "Inland Empire" I was also observing how the brain struggles to solve a puzzle and capture the meaning. No matter how complex the pattern, there is one in "Inland Empire". However "8&frac12;" offered none, it was so difficult to follow the movie that the brain failed and shut itself down. (I fell asleep once.) So what was the problem? Or was there a problem? Or the "problem" itself was a remarkable clue? "8&frac12;" begins with a dream. What is the purpose or the meaning of this beginning? Usually artists are inspired by dreams. Fellini's case is different; he was inspired by the nature of dreams. For many of us, dreams are like films without a director. The fact is everything requires a direction or orchestration, our romantic or non-romantic relationships, our ideas, our memories, life as a whole. As a movie "8&frac12;" itself lacks the direction (and orchestration) until the final scene in which Guido finally grabs a megaphone and the orchestra and the walk in harmony herald us that the crisis is over.

    I have seem La Dolce Vita before this film and this one is a million times better. I wasn't expecting it to be so good and griping. Also, I noticed that people here said that this film wasn't "entertaining", now, that's something I don't understand: how could this film be not considered entertaining considering it grips your attention to the screen during the entire time? I mean, this film is brilliantly entertaining and caused all range of emotions on me during its 140 minute duration. However, this thing is really crazy stuff. One that tries to see this film as some rational/conventional story line which is perfectly understandable will not like it. It's more like Apocalypse Now on crack.

    Let go and give yourself over to Fellini, it's best that way. Fighting for meaning will only result in frustration. Some films need to seep into your dreams to bloom - this is one of those.Give it to your subconscious and let the imagery unfold and reveal the contemplations without the mental gymnastics. This IS a very straight forward film if you let it be and it begs for conversation so see it with someone that will enjoy a few hours of intellectual stretching. Fellini has grown on me but it took the interviews on the Criterion La Strada disc to make that happen. I highly recommend these if you're new to Fellini,they answer some of the questions a first time viewer could fall into without spoiling the films.

Some films need to seep into your dreams to bloom - this is one of those.Give it to your subconscious and let the imagery unfold and reveal the contemplations without the mental gymnastics. This IS a very straight forward film if you let it be and it begs for conversation so see it with someone that will enjoy a few hours of intellectual stretching. Fellini has grown on me but it took the interviews on the Criterion La Strada disc to make that happen. I highly recommend these if you're new to Fellini,they answer some of the questions a first time viewer could fall into without spoiling the films.

    8&frac12; is my first film from Frederico Fellini and while I can't say I really liked it, there are many aspects I appreciated here. It's interesting how Fellini makes you feel like you're inside this troubled filmmaker's mind, constantly intercalating flashbacks of his memories with his fantasies and reality. Essentially, the story is about Guido, a famous director who suffers from a creative block and is unable to come up with new ideas for his upcoming film. However, it's so much deeper than that as he retreats to his dreams and memories, hoping to get inspired while also having to cope with personal struggles and the absurd amount of pressure from the cast and crew. I liked how vibrant the characters were at times and the camera work here is simply astounding. The opening dream sequence was very innovative and the way Fellini introduces each character, making Guido interact with so many of them at the same time was excellent. I was also surprised by how funny some of these encounters got (mainly in the first half of the film). While I appreciate the surrealism and strangeness here, I felt that some characters weren't particularly interesting and some sequences were a bit too extended so I wasn't very engaged with the story on certain occasions. Still, 8&frac12; is a fascinating and insightful work of art and certainly worth seeing by any film enthusiast.

    Directors generally see things around and write scripts. But Fellini dreams and with his movie he takes you to a place where you could never be. In the movie, he ultimately transforms a dream like sequence to reality and its such a wonder. Compared to other Fellini's movies like Satyricon this is straight-forward but I still recommend viewing it number of times to appreciate the magic of Fellini. Certain characters are nothing but projection at the protagonist's mind. While few others are one and same. The BGM is fantastic (mostly from Western classical) and did I mention the famous "Harem scene". There is a mid-aged prostitute shown too scary in the movie as Fellini is known to show women in beautiful yet scary way. This semi-autobiographical movie is impossible to rate so beyond 10/10.

    There are movies and movies. Many movies are "just movies", that is, perfectly ordinary, undistinguish movies. Many are bad. Many are okay. Some are great. Some are unusual. "8&frac12;" (in Italian, 'Otto e mezzo') might just be one of those special cases. It is a brain teaser because it's spectacularly confusing. It is a jigsaw puzzle because it's extremely complex. It isn't one of those movies which you can say &laquo;Eureka! I got it!&raquo; at first, perhaps not even on a 16th or a 22nd viewing. It is possible to understand it better (more or less) with time and subsequent viewings. But it requires attention and patience, not only for being such a complicated film but also because it's a long one (2 hours and 10 minutes). Definitely not a film for people who are lazy to (or simply don't like to) burn their brains thinking. This is not an easy film to evaluate. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not when I first saw it. Meanwhile I've come to realize that I like it. It burns my brain yet I like that about it. It obliges me to reflect and to disclose its mysteries. The story is very strange and intriguing: Guido, a film director, is going through a crisis Â– to be more precise, he is suffering from "director's block". He feels trapped while doing his latest film and his personal life isn't doing much better. Flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies, often shaping up with reality. As a result, it's almost impossible for the viewer(s) to distinguish reality from fiction. This brilliant concept was much later used in the great Spanish film "Abre los ojos" (1997). Attention, that I mean only the concept of being unable to tell reality from fiction. "8&frac12;" seems to be unanimously considered Federico Fellini's best. It's a highly influential movie in many ways. In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed, the videoclip of the wonderful song "Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M., is more than just a wee bit inspired by the traffic jam in the opening dream sequence of Fellini's "8&frac12;". And this in 1993, exactly 30 years later. Marcello Mastroianni is great as Guido. The gorgeous Claudia Cardinale does a great acting as Claudia (whom Guido casts as a movie star that represents his ideal of a woman). The use of music deserves a word or two from me. There is a musical score by Nino Rota, but the classical music draws the attention as well, such as the noted "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner and, best of all, cream of the crop, tip of the top, the glorious "The Barber of Seville (Overture)" by Gioachino Rossini. This Italian piece of classical music is an underrated and often forgotten masterpiece and it was also used in one episode of "Tom and Jerry" before and much later in 1978 in the Italian TV commercial "Lancio Citro&euml;n Visa", a wonderful 10- minute long video about that very nice French car made at the time it was launched to the market. In conclusion, "8&frac12;" is a towering achievement and one of the great italians. Title in Portugal: "Fellini Oito e Meio".

    A director is supposed to be working on a big-budget film that is part science fiction, part autobiography, but he becomes obsessed with the process of casting actresses to portray the various women in his life: his wife, his mistresses, his first crush, women he passed on the street, and finally even the actresses who represent these women. This is a lengthy, often-abstract, but usually-coherent reflection of the director's conflicted attitudes and desires. Through fantasy sequences it displays the character's private thoughts and memories with disarming honesty and a fair amount of humor. Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York" (2008) could almost be said to be a remake of "8 1/2," or at least a very similar rumination on very similar ideas.

    I don't want to write a review. I just want to dedicate a few words to the greatest film of all time. Along with 'Last Year At Marienbad' this would be discussed and dissected even after a thousand years. People then, would also stand in awe. Tears of joy will roll down their cheeks. Art is immortal. And this is the highest point of art. Exactly 50 years ago, 8&frac12; was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. 50 years have gone by. A 1000 more will pass by, but the most exciting, ethereal, magical, exhilarating, brilliant, astounding piece of art, ever created on celluloid, will remain immortal. My favourite film of all time. Il Maestro and Marcello and Rota will live on forever. So will 'Asa Nisi Masa' and 'Saraghina'. And we'll hold hands and dance to the ending tune till eternity. Here's raising a toast to the film where the law of diminishing marginal utility doesn't apply :) Cinema is 8&frac12;

    On the surface, the story may seem straightforward if you read a synopsis of "8&frac12;," but once you actually watch this movie, it will seem like a convoluted mess that makes no sense. Heck, I found myself getting irritated trying to make sense of what is going on until I realized that this film is actually taking place inside of the main character's head, which means its filled with dreamlike fantasies which range from relationship issues and his childhood which seem to seep into his thoughts as he goes through the pressures of writer's block, coupled with the pressure from the public eye in trying to create a new film. I was expecting not to like this film at all, but unexpectedly I began to see something special about as I was watching this. This movie has a certain feeling to it that is different than a lot of movies. Sure the story may not be good as every other classic. Sure the story may not be dark and brooding. Sure the movie may seem redundant at times. The thing that I love is how the film presents itself. I was trying to figure out how to comprehend what's going on the same way I try to comprehend my own dreams. What I got from this is that it is a story of one's own confusion and the struggle to find clarity in a life where everyone is in your face. It's convoluted to the point where you sometimes cannot tell the transitions from dream to reality. Some are more distinct than others, but the beauty of it all is the beautiful cinematography that gives a strange atmosphere somehow throughout the film with unfamiliar settings and strange situations that is sometimes nonsensical. This is a very unique movie that is so idiosyncratic in its style and it's one of my favorite movies that I have seen and still want to see again.

    Patience and concentration is utmost necessary if you want to see this film. The film tries to depict the block situation of a director. The protagonist is not able to conceive a film and is also suffering from his haunting past. What he wanted to show was a type of abstract film and he had to struggle with the finances. PROS: The film at sometimes becomes very much interesting and makes me remember the truffaut's masterpiece Â– 'Day for night'. One thing was sure, the director in the film was confused about his film and what he was doing and thinking was also confusing. CONS: The film has opening and some sequences confusing. It became difficult to figure out when he was dreaming and when they were shooting. VERDICT: "For mature audience."

    While I was watching "Inland Empire" I was also observing how the brain struggles to solve a puzzle and capture the meaning. No matter how complex the pattern, there is one in "Inland Empire". However "8&frac12;" offered none, it was so difficult to follow the movie that the brain failed and shut itself down. (I fell asleep once.) So what was the problem? Or was there a problem? Or the "problem" itself was a remarkable clue? "8&frac12;" begins with a dream. What is the purpose or the meaning of this beginning? Usually artists are inspired by dreams. Fellini's case is different; he was inspired by the nature of dreams. For many of us, dreams are like films without a director. The fact is everything requires a direction or orchestration, our romantic or non-romantic relationships, our ideas, our memories, life as a whole. As a movie "8&frac12;" itself lacks the direction (and orchestration) until the final scene in which Guido finally grabs a megaphone and the orchestra and the walk in harmony herald us that the crisis is over.

    I have seem La Dolce Vita before this film and this one is a million times better. I wasn't expecting it to be so good and griping. Also, I noticed that people here said that this film wasn't "entertaining", now, that's something I don't understand: how could this film be not considered entertaining considering it grips your attention to the screen during the entire time? I mean, this film is brilliantly entertaining and caused all range of emotions on me during its 140 minute duration. However, this thing is really crazy stuff. One that tries to see this film as some rational/conventional story line which is perfectly understandable will not like it. It's more like Apocalypse Now on crack.

I liked how vibrant the characters were at times and the camera work here is simply astounding. The opening dream sequence was very innovative and the way Fellini introduces each character, making Guido interact with so many of them at the same time was excellent. I was also surprised by how funny some of these encounters got (mainly in the first half of the film). While I appreciate the surrealism and strangeness here, I felt that some characters weren't particularly interesting and some sequences were a bit too extended so I wasn't very engaged with the story on certain occasions. Still, 8&frac12; is a fascinating and insightful work of art and certainly worth seeing by any film enthusiast.

    Directors generally see things around and write scripts. But Fellini dreams and with his movie he takes you to a place where you could never be. In the movie, he ultimately transforms a dream like sequence to reality and its such a wonder. Compared to other Fellini's movies like Satyricon this is straight-forward but I still recommend viewing it number of times to appreciate the magic of Fellini. Certain characters are nothing but projection at the protagonist's mind. While few others are one and same. The BGM is fantastic (mostly from Western classical) and did I mention the famous "Harem scene". There is a mid-aged prostitute shown too scary in the movie as Fellini is known to show women in beautiful yet scary way. This semi-autobiographical movie is impossible to rate so beyond 10/10.

    There are movies and movies. Many movies are "just movies", that is, perfectly ordinary, undistinguish movies. Many are bad. Many are okay. Some are great. Some are unusual. "8&frac12;" (in Italian, 'Otto e mezzo') might just be one of those special cases. It is a brain teaser because it's spectacularly confusing. It is a jigsaw puzzle because it's extremely complex. It isn't one of those movies which you can say &laquo;Eureka! I got it!&raquo; at first, perhaps not even on a 16th or a 22nd viewing. It is possible to understand it better (more or less) with time and subsequent viewings. But it requires attention and patience, not only for being such a complicated film but also because it's a long one (2 hours and 10 minutes). Definitely not a film for people who are lazy to (or simply don't like to) burn their brains thinking. This is not an easy film to evaluate. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not when I first saw it. Meanwhile I've come to realize that I like it. It burns my brain yet I like that about it. It obliges me to reflect and to disclose its mysteries. The story is very strange and intriguing: Guido, a film director, is going through a crisis Â– to be more precise, he is suffering from "director's block". He feels trapped while doing his latest film and his personal life isn't doing much better. Flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies, often shaping up with reality. As a result, it's almost impossible for the viewer(s) to distinguish reality from fiction. This brilliant concept was much later used in the great Spanish film "Abre los ojos" (1997). Attention, that I mean only the concept of being unable to tell reality from fiction. "8&frac12;" seems to be unanimously considered Federico Fellini's best. It's a highly influential movie in many ways. In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed, the videoclip of the wonderful song "Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M., is more than just a wee bit inspired by the traffic jam in the opening dream sequence of Fellini's "8&frac12;". And this in 1993, exactly 30 years later. Marcello Mastroianni is great as Guido. The gorgeous Claudia Cardinale does a great acting as Claudia (whom Guido casts as a movie star that represents his ideal of a woman). The use of music deserves a word or two from me. There is a musical score by Nino Rota, but the classical music draws the attention as well, such as the noted "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner and, best of all, cream of the crop, tip of the top, the glorious "The Barber of Seville (Overture)" by Gioachino Rossini. This Italian piece of classical music is an underrated and often forgotten masterpiece and it was also used in one episode of "Tom and Jerry" before and much later in 1978 in the Italian TV commercial "Lancio Citro&euml;n Visa", a wonderful 10- minute long video about that very nice French car made at the time it was launched to the market. In conclusion, "8&frac12;" is a towering achievement and one of the great italians. Title in Portugal: "Fellini Oito e Meio".

    A director is supposed to be working on a big-budget film that is part science fiction, part autobiography, but he becomes obsessed with the process of casting actresses to portray the various women in his life: his wife, his mistresses, his first crush, women he passed on the street, and finally even the actresses who represent these women. This is a lengthy, often-abstract, but usually-coherent reflection of the director's conflicted attitudes and desires. Through fantasy sequences it displays the character's private thoughts and memories with disarming honesty and a fair amount of humor. Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York" (2008) could almost be said to be a remake of "8 1/2," or at least a very similar rumination on very similar ideas.

    I don't want to write a review. I just want to dedicate a few words to the greatest film of all time. Along with 'Last Year At Marienbad' this would be discussed and dissected even after a thousand years. People then, would also stand in awe. Tears of joy will roll down their cheeks. Art is immortal. And this is the highest point of art. Exactly 50 years ago, 8&frac12; was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. 50 years have gone by. A 1000 more will pass by, but the most exciting, ethereal, magical, exhilarating, brilliant, astounding piece of art, ever created on celluloid, will remain immortal. My favourite film of all time. Il Maestro and Marcello and Rota will live on forever. So will 'Asa Nisi Masa' and 'Saraghina'. And we'll hold hands and dance to the ending tune till eternity. Here's raising a toast to the film where the law of diminishing marginal utility doesn't apply :) Cinema is 8&frac12;

    On the surface, the story may seem straightforward if you read a synopsis of "8&frac12;," but once you actually watch this movie, it will seem like a convoluted mess that makes no sense. Heck, I found myself getting irritated trying to make sense of what is going on until I realized that this film is actually taking place inside of the main character's head, which means its filled with dreamlike fantasies which range from relationship issues and his childhood which seem to seep into his thoughts as he goes through the pressures of writer's block, coupled with the pressure from the public eye in trying to create a new film. I was expecting not to like this film at all, but unexpectedly I began to see something special about as I was watching this. This movie has a certain feeling to it that is different than a lot of movies. Sure the story may not be good as every other classic. Sure the story may not be dark and brooding. Sure the movie may seem redundant at times. The thing that I love is how the film presents itself. I was trying to figure out how to comprehend what's going on the same way I try to comprehend my own dreams. What I got from this is that it is a story of one's own confusion and the struggle to find clarity in a life where everyone is in your face. It's convoluted to the point where you sometimes cannot tell the transitions from dream to reality. Some are more distinct than others, but the beauty of it all is the beautiful cinematography that gives a strange atmosphere somehow throughout the film with unfamiliar settings and strange situations that is sometimes nonsensical. This is a very unique movie that is so idiosyncratic in its style and it's one of my favorite movies that I have seen and still want to see again.

    Patience and concentration is utmost necessary if you want to see this film. The film tries to depict the block situation of a director. The protagonist is not able to conceive a film and is also suffering from his haunting past. What he wanted to show was a type of abstract film and he had to struggle with the finances. PROS: The film at sometimes becomes very much interesting and makes me remember the truffaut's masterpiece Â– 'Day for night'. One thing was sure, the director in the film was confused about his film and what he was doing and thinking was also confusing. CONS: The film has opening and some sequences confusing. It became difficult to figure out when he was dreaming and when they were shooting. VERDICT: "For mature audience."

    While I was watching "Inland Empire" I was also observing how the brain struggles to solve a puzzle and capture the meaning. No matter how complex the pattern, there is one in "Inland Empire". However "8&frac12;" offered none, it was so difficult to follow the movie that the brain failed and shut itself down. (I fell asleep once.) So what was the problem? Or was there a problem? Or the "problem" itself was a remarkable clue? "8&frac12;" begins with a dream. What is the purpose or the meaning of this beginning? Usually artists are inspired by dreams. Fellini's case is different; he was inspired by the nature of dreams. For many of us, dreams are like films without a director. The fact is everything requires a direction or orchestration, our romantic or non-romantic relationships, our ideas, our memories, life as a whole. As a movie "8&frac12;" itself lacks the direction (and orchestration) until the final scene in which Guido finally grabs a megaphone and the orchestra and the walk in harmony herald us that the crisis is over.

    I have seem La Dolce Vita before this film and this one is a million times better. I wasn't expecting it to be so good and griping. Also, I noticed that people here said that this film wasn't "entertaining", now, that's something I don't understand: how could this film be not considered entertaining considering it grips your attention to the screen during the entire time? I mean, this film is brilliantly entertaining and caused all range of emotions on me during its 140 minute duration. However, this thing is really crazy stuff. One that tries to see this film as some rational/conventional story line which is perfectly understandable will not like it. It's more like Apocalypse Now on crack.

    Let go and give yourself over to Fellini, it's best that way. Fighting for meaning will only result in frustration. Some films need to seep into your dreams to bloom - this is one of those.Give it to your subconscious and let the imagery unfold and reveal the contemplations without the mental gymnastics. This IS a very straight forward film if you let it be and it begs for conversation so see it with someone that will enjoy a few hours of intellectual stretching. Fellini has grown on me but it took the interviews on the Criterion La Strada disc to make that happen. I highly recommend these if you're new to Fellini,they answer some of the questions a first time viewer could fall into without spoiling the films.

Certain characters are nothing but projection at the protagonist's mind. While few others are one and same. The BGM is fantastic (mostly from Western classical) and did I mention the famous "Harem scene". There is a mid-aged prostitute shown too scary in the movie as Fellini is known to show women in beautiful yet scary way. This semi-autobiographical movie is impossible to rate so beyond 10/10.

    There are movies and movies. Many movies are "just movies", that is, perfectly ordinary, undistinguish movies. Many are bad. Many are okay. Some are great. Some are unusual. "8&frac12;" (in Italian, 'Otto e mezzo') might just be one of those special cases. It is a brain teaser because it's spectacularly confusing. It is a jigsaw puzzle because it's extremely complex. It isn't one of those movies which you can say &laquo;Eureka! I got it!&raquo; at first, perhaps not even on a 16th or a 22nd viewing. It is possible to understand it better (more or less) with time and subsequent viewings. But it requires attention and patience, not only for being such a complicated film but also because it's a long one (2 hours and 10 minutes). Definitely not a film for people who are lazy to (or simply don't like to) burn their brains thinking. This is not an easy film to evaluate. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not when I first saw it. Meanwhile I've come to realize that I like it. It burns my brain yet I like that about it. It obliges me to reflect and to disclose its mysteries. The story is very strange and intriguing: Guido, a film director, is going through a crisis Â– to be more precise, he is suffering from "director's block". He feels trapped while doing his latest film and his personal life isn't doing much better. Flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies, often shaping up with reality. As a result, it's almost impossible for the viewer(s) to distinguish reality from fiction. This brilliant concept was much later used in the great Spanish film "Abre los ojos" (1997). Attention, that I mean only the concept of being unable to tell reality from fiction. "8&frac12;" seems to be unanimously considered Federico Fellini's best. It's a highly influential movie in many ways. In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed, the videoclip of the wonderful song "Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M., is more than just a wee bit inspired by the traffic jam in the opening dream sequence of Fellini's "8&frac12;". And this in 1993, exactly 30 years later. Marcello Mastroianni is great as Guido. The gorgeous Claudia Cardinale does a great acting as Claudia (whom Guido casts as a movie star that represents his ideal of a woman). The use of music deserves a word or two from me. There is a musical score by Nino Rota, but the classical music draws the attention as well, such as the noted "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner and, best of all, cream of the crop, tip of the top, the glorious "The Barber of Seville (Overture)" by Gioachino Rossini. This Italian piece of classical music is an underrated and often forgotten masterpiece and it was also used in one episode of "Tom and Jerry" before and much later in 1978 in the Italian TV commercial "Lancio Citro&euml;n Visa", a wonderful 10- minute long video about that very nice French car made at the time it was launched to the market. In conclusion, "8&frac12;" is a towering achievement and one of the great italians. Title in Portugal: "Fellini Oito e Meio".

    A director is supposed to be working on a big-budget film that is part science fiction, part autobiography, but he becomes obsessed with the process of casting actresses to portray the various women in his life: his wife, his mistresses, his first crush, women he passed on the street, and finally even the actresses who represent these women. This is a lengthy, often-abstract, but usually-coherent reflection of the director's conflicted attitudes and desires. Through fantasy sequences it displays the character's private thoughts and memories with disarming honesty and a fair amount of humor. Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York" (2008) could almost be said to be a remake of "8 1/2," or at least a very similar rumination on very similar ideas.

    I don't want to write a review. I just want to dedicate a few words to the greatest film of all time. Along with 'Last Year At Marienbad' this would be discussed and dissected even after a thousand years. People then, would also stand in awe. Tears of joy will roll down their cheeks. Art is immortal. And this is the highest point of art. Exactly 50 years ago, 8&frac12; was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. 50 years have gone by. A 1000 more will pass by, but the most exciting, ethereal, magical, exhilarating, brilliant, astounding piece of art, ever created on celluloid, will remain immortal. My favourite film of all time. Il Maestro and Marcello and Rota will live on forever. So will 'Asa Nisi Masa' and 'Saraghina'. And we'll hold hands and dance to the ending tune till eternity. Here's raising a toast to the film where the law of diminishing marginal utility doesn't apply :) Cinema is 8&frac12;

    On the surface, the story may seem straightforward if you read a synopsis of "8&frac12;," but once you actually watch this movie, it will seem like a convoluted mess that makes no sense. Heck, I found myself getting irritated trying to make sense of what is going on until I realized that this film is actually taking place inside of the main character's head, which means its filled with dreamlike fantasies which range from relationship issues and his childhood which seem to seep into his thoughts as he goes through the pressures of writer's block, coupled with the pressure from the public eye in trying to create a new film. I was expecting not to like this film at all, but unexpectedly I began to see something special about as I was watching this. This movie has a certain feeling to it that is different than a lot of movies. Sure the story may not be good as every other classic. Sure the story may not be dark and brooding. Sure the movie may seem redundant at times. The thing that I love is how the film presents itself. I was trying to figure out how to comprehend what's going on the same way I try to comprehend my own dreams. What I got from this is that it is a story of one's own confusion and the struggle to find clarity in a life where everyone is in your face. It's convoluted to the point where you sometimes cannot tell the transitions from dream to reality. Some are more distinct than others, but the beauty of it all is the beautiful cinematography that gives a strange atmosphere somehow throughout the film with unfamiliar settings and strange situations that is sometimes nonsensical. This is a very unique movie that is so idiosyncratic in its style and it's one of my favorite movies that I have seen and still want to see again.

    Patience and concentration is utmost necessary if you want to see this film. The film tries to depict the block situation of a director. The protagonist is not able to conceive a film and is also suffering from his haunting past. What he wanted to show was a type of abstract film and he had to struggle with the finances. PROS: The film at sometimes becomes very much interesting and makes me remember the truffaut's masterpiece Â– 'Day for night'. One thing was sure, the director in the film was confused about his film and what he was doing and thinking was also confusing. CONS: The film has opening and some sequences confusing. It became difficult to figure out when he was dreaming and when they were shooting. VERDICT: "For mature audience."

    While I was watching "Inland Empire" I was also observing how the brain struggles to solve a puzzle and capture the meaning. No matter how complex the pattern, there is one in "Inland Empire". However "8&frac12;" offered none, it was so difficult to follow the movie that the brain failed and shut itself down. (I fell asleep once.) So what was the problem? Or was there a problem? Or the "problem" itself was a remarkable clue? "8&frac12;" begins with a dream. What is the purpose or the meaning of this beginning? Usually artists are inspired by dreams. Fellini's case is different; he was inspired by the nature of dreams. For many of us, dreams are like films without a director. The fact is everything requires a direction or orchestration, our romantic or non-romantic relationships, our ideas, our memories, life as a whole. As a movie "8&frac12;" itself lacks the direction (and orchestration) until the final scene in which Guido finally grabs a megaphone and the orchestra and the walk in harmony herald us that the crisis is over.

    I have seem La Dolce Vita before this film and this one is a million times better. I wasn't expecting it to be so good and griping. Also, I noticed that people here said that this film wasn't "entertaining", now, that's something I don't understand: how could this film be not considered entertaining considering it grips your attention to the screen during the entire time? I mean, this film is brilliantly entertaining and caused all range of emotions on me during its 140 minute duration. However, this thing is really crazy stuff. One that tries to see this film as some rational/conventional story line which is perfectly understandable will not like it. It's more like Apocalypse Now on crack.

    Let go and give yourself over to Fellini, it's best that way. Fighting for meaning will only result in frustration. Some films need to seep into your dreams to bloom - this is one of those.Give it to your subconscious and let the imagery unfold and reveal the contemplations without the mental gymnastics. This IS a very straight forward film if you let it be and it begs for conversation so see it with someone that will enjoy a few hours of intellectual stretching. Fellini has grown on me but it took the interviews on the Criterion La Strada disc to make that happen. I highly recommend these if you're new to Fellini,they answer some of the questions a first time viewer could fall into without spoiling the films.

    8&frac12; is my first film from Frederico Fellini and while I can't say I really liked it, there are many aspects I appreciated here. It's interesting how Fellini makes you feel like you're inside this troubled filmmaker's mind, constantly intercalating flashbacks of his memories with his fantasies and reality. Essentially, the story is about Guido, a famous director who suffers from a creative block and is unable to come up with new ideas for his upcoming film. However, it's so much deeper than that as he retreats to his dreams and memories, hoping to get inspired while also having to cope with personal struggles and the absurd amount of pressure from the cast and crew. I liked how vibrant the characters were at times and the camera work here is simply astounding. The opening dream sequence was very innovative and the way Fellini introduces each character, making Guido interact with so many of them at the same time was excellent. I was also surprised by how funny some of these encounters got (mainly in the first half of the film). While I appreciate the surrealism and strangeness here, I felt that some characters weren't particularly interesting and some sequences were a bit too extended so I wasn't very engaged with the story on certain occasions. Still, 8&frac12; is a fascinating and insightful work of art and certainly worth seeing by any film enthusiast.

    Directors generally see things around and write scripts. But Fellini dreams and with his movie he takes you to a place where you could never be.

But it requires attention and patience, not only for being such a complicated film but also because it's a long one (2 hours and 10 minutes). Definitely not a film for people who are lazy to (or simply don't like to) burn their brains thinking. This is not an easy film to evaluate. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not when I first saw it. Meanwhile I've come to realize that I like it. It burns my brain yet I like that about it. It obliges me to reflect and to disclose its mysteries. The story is very strange and intriguing: Guido, a film director, is going through a crisis Â– to be more precise, he is suffering from "director's block". He feels trapped while doing his latest film and his personal life isn't doing much better. Flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies, often shaping up with reality. As a result, it's almost impossible for the viewer(s) to distinguish reality from fiction. This brilliant concept was much later used in the great Spanish film "Abre los ojos" (1997). Attention, that I mean only the concept of being unable to tell reality from fiction. "8&frac12;" seems to be unanimously considered Federico Fellini's best. It's a highly influential movie in many ways. In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed, the videoclip of the wonderful song "Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M., is more than just a wee bit inspired by the traffic jam in the opening dream sequence of Fellini's "8&frac12;". And this in 1993, exactly 30 years later. Marcello Mastroianni is great as Guido. The gorgeous Claudia Cardinale does a great acting as Claudia (whom Guido casts as a movie star that represents his ideal of a woman). The use of music deserves a word or two from me. There is a musical score by Nino Rota, but the classical music draws the attention as well, such as the noted "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner and, best of all, cream of the crop, tip of the top, the glorious "The Barber of Seville (Overture)" by Gioachino Rossini. This Italian piece of classical music is an underrated and often forgotten masterpiece and it was also used in one episode of "Tom and Jerry" before and much later in 1978 in the Italian TV commercial "Lancio Citro&euml;n Visa", a wonderful 10- minute long video about that very nice French car made at the time it was launched to the market. In conclusion, "8&frac12;" is a towering achievement and one of the great italians. Title in Portugal: "Fellini Oito e Meio".

    A director is supposed to be working on a big-budget film that is part science fiction, part autobiography, but he becomes obsessed with the process of casting actresses to portray the various women in his life: his wife, his mistresses, his first crush, women he passed on the street, and finally even the actresses who represent these women. This is a lengthy, often-abstract, but usually-coherent reflection of the director's conflicted attitudes and desires. Through fantasy sequences it displays the character's private thoughts and memories with disarming honesty and a fair amount of humor. Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York" (2008) could almost be said to be a remake of "8 1/2," or at least a very similar rumination on very similar ideas.

    I don't want to write a review. I just want to dedicate a few words to the greatest film of all time. Along with 'Last Year At Marienbad' this would be discussed and dissected even after a thousand years. People then, would also stand in awe. Tears of joy will roll down their cheeks. Art is immortal. And this is the highest point of art. Exactly 50 years ago, 8&frac12; was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. 50 years have gone by. A 1000 more will pass by, but the most exciting, ethereal, magical, exhilarating, brilliant, astounding piece of art, ever created on celluloid, will remain immortal. My favourite film of all time. Il Maestro and Marcello and Rota will live on forever. So will 'Asa Nisi Masa' and 'Saraghina'. And we'll hold hands and dance to the ending tune till eternity. Here's raising a toast to the film where the law of diminishing marginal utility doesn't apply :) Cinema is 8&frac12;

    On the surface, the story may seem straightforward if you read a synopsis of "8&frac12;," but once you actually watch this movie, it will seem like a convoluted mess that makes no sense. Heck, I found myself getting irritated trying to make sense of what is going on until I realized that this film is actually taking place inside of the main character's head, which means its filled with dreamlike fantasies which range from relationship issues and his childhood which seem to seep into his thoughts as he goes through the pressures of writer's block, coupled with the pressure from the public eye in trying to create a new film. I was expecting not to like this film at all, but unexpectedly I began to see something special about as I was watching this. This movie has a certain feeling to it that is different than a lot of movies. Sure the story may not be good as every other classic. Sure the story may not be dark and brooding. Sure the movie may seem redundant at times. The thing that I love is how the film presents itself. I was trying to figure out how to comprehend what's going on the same way I try to comprehend my own dreams. What I got from this is that it is a story of one's own confusion and the struggle to find clarity in a life where everyone is in your face. It's convoluted to the point where you sometimes cannot tell the transitions from dream to reality. Some are more distinct than others, but the beauty of it all is the beautiful cinematography that gives a strange atmosphere somehow throughout the film with unfamiliar settings and strange situations that is sometimes nonsensical. This is a very unique movie that is so idiosyncratic in its style and it's one of my favorite movies that I have seen and still want to see again.

    Patience and concentration is utmost necessary if you want to see this film. The film tries to depict the block situation of a director. The protagonist is not able to conceive a film and is also suffering from his haunting past. What he wanted to show was a type of abstract film and he had to struggle with the finances. PROS: The film at sometimes becomes very much interesting and makes me remember the truffaut's masterpiece Â– 'Day for night'. One thing was sure, the director in the film was confused about his film and what he was doing and thinking was also confusing. CONS: The film has opening and some sequences confusing. It became difficult to figure out when he was dreaming and when they were shooting. VERDICT: "For mature audience."

    While I was watching "Inland Empire" I was also observing how the brain struggles to solve a puzzle and capture the meaning. No matter how complex the pattern, there is one in "Inland Empire". However "8&frac12;" offered none, it was so difficult to follow the movie that the brain failed and shut itself down. (I fell asleep once.) So what was the problem? Or was there a problem? Or the "problem" itself was a remarkable clue? "8&frac12;" begins with a dream. What is the purpose or the meaning of this beginning? Usually artists are inspired by dreams. Fellini's case is different; he was inspired by the nature of dreams. For many of us, dreams are like films without a director. The fact is everything requires a direction or orchestration, our romantic or non-romantic relationships, our ideas, our memories, life as a whole. As a movie "8&frac12;" itself lacks the direction (and orchestration) until the final scene in which Guido finally grabs a megaphone and the orchestra and the walk in harmony herald us that the crisis is over.

    I have seem La Dolce Vita before this film and this one is a million times better. I wasn't expecting it to be so good and griping. Also, I noticed that people here said that this film wasn't "entertaining", now, that's something I don't understand: how could this film be not considered entertaining considering it grips your attention to the screen during the entire time? I mean, this film is brilliantly entertaining and caused all range of emotions on me during its 140 minute duration. However, this thing is really crazy stuff. One that tries to see this film as some rational/conventional story line which is perfectly understandable will not like it. It's more like Apocalypse Now on crack.

    Let go and give yourself over to Fellini, it's best that way. Fighting for meaning will only result in frustration. Some films need to seep into your dreams to bloom - this is one of those.Give it to your subconscious and let the imagery unfold and reveal the contemplations without the mental gymnastics. This IS a very straight forward film if you let it be and it begs for conversation so see it with someone that will enjoy a few hours of intellectual stretching. Fellini has grown on me but it took the interviews on the Criterion La Strada disc to make that happen. I highly recommend these if you're new to Fellini,they answer some of the questions a first time viewer could fall into without spoiling the films.

    8&frac12; is my first film from Frederico Fellini and while I can't say I really liked it, there are many aspects I appreciated here. It's interesting how Fellini makes you feel like you're inside this troubled filmmaker's mind, constantly intercalating flashbacks of his memories with his fantasies and reality. Essentially, the story is about Guido, a famous director who suffers from a creative block and is unable to come up with new ideas for his upcoming film. However, it's so much deeper than that as he retreats to his dreams and memories, hoping to get inspired while also having to cope with personal struggles and the absurd amount of pressure from the cast and crew. I liked how vibrant the characters were at times and the camera work here is simply astounding. The opening dream sequence was very innovative and the way Fellini introduces each character, making Guido interact with so many of them at the same time was excellent. I was also surprised by how funny some of these encounters got (mainly in the first half of the film). While I appreciate the surrealism and strangeness here, I felt that some characters weren't particularly interesting and some sequences were a bit too extended so I wasn't very engaged with the story on certain occasions. Still, 8&frac12; is a fascinating and insightful work of art and certainly worth seeing by any film enthusiast.

    Directors generally see things around and write scripts. But Fellini dreams and with his movie he takes you to a place where you could never be. In the movie, he ultimately transforms a dream like sequence to reality and its such a wonder. Compared to other Fellini's movies like Satyricon this is straight-forward but I still recommend viewing it number of times to appreciate the magic of Fellini. Certain characters are nothing but projection at the protagonist's mind. While few others are one and same. The BGM is fantastic (mostly from Western classical) and did I mention the famous "Harem scene". There is a mid-aged prostitute shown too scary in the movie as Fellini is known to show women in beautiful yet scary way. This semi-autobiographical movie is impossible to rate so beyond 10/10.

    There are movies and movies. Many movies are "just movies", that is, perfectly ordinary, undistinguish movies. Many are bad. Many are okay. Some are great. Some are unusual. "8&frac12;" (in Italian, 'Otto e mezzo') might just be one of those special cases. It is a brain teaser because it's spectacularly confusing. It is a jigsaw puzzle because it's extremely complex. It isn't one of those movies which you can say &laquo;Eureka! I got it!&raquo; at first, perhaps not even on a 16th or a 22nd viewing. It is possible to understand it better (more or less) with time and subsequent viewings.
