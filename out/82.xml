    I understand that the special effects and the originality of the underlying script justify some respect to this work. However the outcome of Mr Spielberg's efforts is nothing but annoying. Cheap thrills reiterating the horror of the "alien" beast and the holiness of the All- American family idol make this a pain to watch. How is a velociraptor transport and transfer device movable by a velociraptor? Why cant a T-Rex smell? Why is the rescue of a Multi-million dollar park left to 6 people suddenly all alone? Why is there no communication with Samuel L Jackson before he opens a bunker system to velociraptors which are hunting in a pack of three (two) outside and inside the bunker? The tears of sentiment brought to my eyes in the first scenes stating the extraordinary scientific achievement suggested are wasted to a dreamed up loss of control seemingly designed to reinstate our faith into the child-skeptic scientist who is "delivered" to be a family man. We are left with the notion "not to mess with god" who conveniently sends a T-Rex to solve our problems as we have confessed(?!). This is a disgrace for the thinking human being to be even considered a perceived reality- it is propaganda at best, destroying all the spirit other commentators might be tempted to mention in its favor. It "makes you think" just the wrong way. Be my guest to doubt the impact of genetic engineering (Monsanto) on existing ecosystems, but do it in a believable sound way, leaving out the Christian fear-mongering bullshit. One might say it is a fairytale alright but why does it try to be realistic when it is not? The notion that this should be voted over Schindler's List makes me cry.

    From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called " Jurassic Park. " Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****

    OK, is the plot that good? No. At least the set up isn't, it's cheesy monster movie stuff. Absolutely every bad decision that could be made generally is. Let's automate an entire park full of giant man eating dinosaurs in 1993. Then let's low ball the entire operation out to one guy. Then let's let the automation with thousands of bugs run the whole park before its ready. Then let's evacuate everyone because of a hurricane ensuring now one is there in case anything goes wrong, except about 10 people including the people inspecting the damned safety of the park for no reason. Then let's have the low balled guy screw everything up in the worst corporate robbery attempt ever by turning off every security system, stealing valuable goods, and just making a run for it onto the boat despite not being told to evacuate and him being the ONLY PERSON on the entire island that could've stolen the goods. And to top it off lets bash science in general as a main theme just because, despite science bringing the dinosaurs which is the entire thing that makes the plot cool to begin with. I know it's a movie, but at some point you begin to question the entire thing. But none of that makes more than a one star dent. Because you know what? The cast is just about absolutely perfect. Jeff Goldblum is so awesome in this movie it's ridiculous, same with Richard Attenborough. The rest of the cast is damned good, John Williams score soars as high as it ever has, and Spielberg is as on point in every shot and step of the way as he was with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The dialog has a weirdly memorable snap and flow to it that makes it as easily followable and memorable as movie like Star Wars: A New Hope and Pulp Fiction. And best of all, dinosaurs are awesome! No matter much progress was derided, no matter many people got eaten, you finish the movie thinking the same thing every time "Damn, seeing a real life dinosaur would be like the coolest most awesome thing EVER!" And that's why it's a must watch. It's just plain entertaining. It's fantastic, it's awesome. When you hear the word's "Welcome, to Jurassic Park" you'll feel like you're watching a real life dinosaur not ten feet in front of you, and that is one the most magical things you'll ever experience.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose... The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly.

    Few movies have had as great an impact on me as Jurassic Park the first time I saw this back in the 1990s as a little kid. This movie was not just a summer blockbuster, it was a pop culture PHENOMENON! I remember fondly those good ol' days, and the EXPLOSION of dinosaur toys, books, movies, TV shows, everything following in the wake of Jurassic Park. I recently had the pleasure of catching Jurassic Park once again on the big screen during the 20th Anniversary Rerelease. Let me begin by saying that Jurassic Park looks as beautiful and stunning on the big screen now as it did 20 years ago - even after so many years, even after Avatar and Inception and The Dark Knight, there is simply no experience that stacks up to seeing Jurassic Park on IMAX 3D! I can speak at great lengths as to the fantastic visual effects and sound work behind the film, the excellent directing by Steven Spielberg, the amazing soundtrack provided by John Williams (which may or may not rival those of Indiana Jones and Star Wars!), or the inspired acting performances by Sam Neil, Richard Attenborough, and, of course, the iconic "Must Go Faster!" Jeff Goldblum. But no, instead, I will focus on what I consider to be the REAL strength of this film, and the main reason why people see it in the first place: why, DINOSAURS, of course! Now, for a film starring DINOSAURS, actual dinosaurs only appear on screen for a total of 15 minutes. The brilliance of Jurassic Park is that, like Spielberg's JAWS, the entire movie is about the BUILD-UP to the dinosaurs, and about how we humans interact with them. Dinosaurs inhabited this planet for 150 million years, over 300 times longer than our species, Homo sapiens, has been around for. They were some of the largest and most magnificent creatures to ever grace Earth's natural history, and even after 65 million years of extinction, they continue to win the fascination and admiration of the human race the world over. Unlike many other movies that portray dinosaurs as mindless man-eating monsters, Jurassic Park actually takes great care to point out that dinosaurs are just animals like any other animal alive today - even the scary carnivores like the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a certain quality about it that you can't help but feel awed and fascinated by it even while you're running for your life! In a way, MAN is the true monster of the film, as it is man who believes himself above nature, and when man interferes with the natural order of the world, chaos and destruction ensues. For a Hollywood summer blockbuster, Jurassic Park is far more cleverly written than it has any right to be, but a lot of that is owed to writer Michael Crichton, that master of original and inventive science fiction stories. Rest in peace, Michael Crichton. Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ...

    A masterpiece of imagination, creativity, suspense, science & cinematic magic and a breathtaking sci-fi adventure that you'll want to experience again & again, Jurassic Park is a landmark motion picture that, today, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of its genre for it not only added an entirely new chapter to the filmmaking manual but also opened up a whole new world of possibilities in film industry with its groundbreaking use of computer graphics. The first film to realize the full potential of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Jurassic Park isn't just a dazzling visual ride that will leave you astonished but will also surprise you with its interesting plot, blistering pace, well-developed characters, rousing music & its significant emphasis on man vs nature element. Adapted from the novel of the same name, Jurassic Park follows two dinosaur experts, Dr. Alan Grant & Dr. Ellie Sattler, who are invited by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond, to a preview tour of his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. Accompanied by a cynical scientist, Ian Malcolm & Hammond's two grandchildren, they discover the island to be full of living dinosaurs, created by a team of genetic scientists from cloning the dinosaurs' DNA collected from biologically preserved prehistoric insects. Everything goes smooth until a storm hits the island & an inside worker allows system security to fail so that he can steal the dinosaurs' embryos for his own monetary motives, allowing the dinosaurs to go loose all over the island thus turning the adventure ride into a race of survival. Director Steven Spielberg has proved over & over again why he is one of the best storytellers in film industry with a rare cinematic vision that appeals to critics & mainstream audience alike. And with Jurassic Park, Spielberg delivers once again to give us an experience that's as entertaining as any typical blockbuster but has enough characterization & substance to rise above the mainstream & etch itself in our minds forever. Michael Crichton, author of the novel, nicely adapts his book into a movie screenplay with finishing touch added by screenwriter David Koepp, and even though the final script leaves out detailed science of cloning and makes significant changes to the plot as well as characters while also toning down the violence, it still manages to do enough for viewers to invest their emotions in this film. Coming to the technical aspects, Jurassic Park has innovation written all over it. The set pieces are impressive to look at. The cinematography is brilliantly done. Editing very much takes care of this film's swift pace. But the one aspect where this film sets a whole new standard is in its pioneering visual & sound effects. The dinosaurs on-screen look insanely real, both the CGI & animatronics ones, and the amount of detail that went into the creation of each dinosaur is remarkable. Sound also breaks all barriers, not only as dinosaurs' roars but overall too and Spielberg put it to great effect in driving our emotions the way he wanted. And finally, the music by John Williams synchronizes so seamlessly with the film's sequences that it ended up elevating the film's experience to new levels. Boasting beautiful, adventurous & heartwarming tracks that in some sequences felt truly epic, the score of Jurassic Park just works and is easily one of Williams' finest. Everyone who watched this film remembers its jaw-dropping special effects but the performances of the cast often gets overlooked. And true that it's not as spectacular as the film's technical achievements, but it did play a vital role nonetheless without which this film would've fallen flat on the ground. It's the human element in this film that connects us with it and makes Jurassic Park what it is; a rip-roaring, thrilling adventure ride. Jurassic Park features an ensemble cast of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson & others and everyone chipped in just enough with their fine performances. Sam Neill stars as palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant and on a deeper analysis, the movie is about his character only and depicts the changes the whole experience of Jurassic Park brings to his personality, thus slashing out the lack of story's motive & character development criticism because the arc of Dr. Grant is very well-developed here but, sadly, is overshadowed by the film's true stars the dinosaurs. Even after 20 years, Jurassic Park hasn't aged a day plus the recent 3D re-release has not only added a new dimension to this film but also depth. In spite of not having a strong script or any notable performances, there is a reason why this film still works. Because the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus scene still dazzles us in ways very few movies are capable of, eventually leaving us with an immense sense of joy & excitement for what's next in store. Overall, Jurassic Park is a movie that was tailor-made for the talents of Steven Spielberg and presents the master director in tremendous form as he not only gave us one of the greatest blockbusters ever but also thrilled us with one unforgettable sequence after another and it, even today, remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. Wonderfully blending the adventure elements with a sense of wonder & amazement that only a Spielberg film can provide, Jurassic Park continues to be one of the most influential films of all time that not only made significant contribution to cinema but also turned an entire generation of spectators into dinosaur-obsessed freaks (I'm still one of them!). The most special film of my life, Jurassic Park is the movie that started my love affair with movies. And I can never thank Spielberg enough for crafting this, 65 million years in the making, adventure.

    Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie with amazing special effects, good leads, and (I don't say this often) a tremendous score. When a park may be open on an island, so John Hammond brings a couple of dinosaur experts, a doctor, and a lawyer to the island to see if they'll endorse the park. But when there, things go wrong one night as the dinosaurs now roam the island freely and it's a fight for survival. This film has had some of the most impressive special effects for a few reasons: 1.) For its time, it really made audiences gasp at its wonder. It's still good compared to today, but even better then. 2.) The effects on the dinosaurs make them seem very real. This is the first movie and one of the only movies where the dinosaurs looked real and made the movie feel real in a way which is hard to do. The film has characters like Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and the children (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards). The film though has characters that are not as good which hurt the film a little like Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is there to be funny but sometimes he is an ass instead of funny, like some people in real life, and made things feel awkward at times, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), an expendable character who is there only to die, not be anything too important as all he does is judge the park and die, and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), the man who screws it up for money and is a fat, lazy, a-hole who is just a pain. He is supposed to be the bad guy and is, but is just too much a pain. This film has my favorite score ever as the film works perfectly into the movie, is peaceful and content and also heroic and bold. It is wonderful. This film is a terrific film that's beautiful to watch and is the same ever time I watch it. Me: A-

    Thanks to the 3D release I could watch this movie on a big screen again. A good movie should resist the passing of time, as in this case. It's visual effects still work, but the important thing is that the suspense still works. Spielberg's movies are always done by the book, and the fact that in this one he doesn't takes advantage of sentimentalism as shamelessly as usual improves the result. The only flaw (or the most significant) is the hilarious ending with the "heroic" T-Rex's appearance as a deus est machina and the falling flag. The best thing is the treatment of the "villain(s)", also by the book: we are told about the velociraptor since the beginning of the movie and it becomes a threatening presence that doesn't reveal itself until the second half of the movie. As in Jaws, things that we don't see are much more scary.

    Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.

    This movie is very original and I enjoyed it for the whole 127 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and the cast for this movie is great. The special effects for this movie were also great, especially the scene in the kitchen with Tim and Lex trying to get away from the Velociraptors. It has the same concept as the movie Tremors, except Jurassic Park is not a comedy. It is about a group of people that are invited to an island called Isla Nublar, which is filled with dinosaurs that were brought back to life. It all goes wrong when the dinosaurs escape and start to go after everybody. In the end, almost everybody gets back safely, but the island is still crawling with dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action packed sci-fi thriller:)

    Few movies have had as great an impact on me as Jurassic Park the first time I saw this back in the 1990s as a little kid. This movie was not just a summer blockbuster, it was a pop culture PHENOMENON! I remember fondly those good ol' days, and the EXPLOSION of dinosaur toys, books, movies, TV shows, everything following in the wake of Jurassic Park. I recently had the pleasure of catching Jurassic Park once again on the big screen during the 20th Anniversary Rerelease. Let me begin by saying that Jurassic Park looks as beautiful and stunning on the big screen now as it did 20 years ago - even after so many years, even after Avatar and Inception and The Dark Knight, there is simply no experience that stacks up to seeing Jurassic Park on IMAX 3D! I can speak at great lengths as to the fantastic visual effects and sound work behind the film, the excellent directing by Steven Spielberg, the amazing soundtrack provided by John Williams (which may or may not rival those of Indiana Jones and Star Wars!), or the inspired acting performances by Sam Neil, Richard Attenborough, and, of course, the iconic "Must Go Faster!" Jeff Goldblum. But no, instead, I will focus on what I consider to be the REAL strength of this film, and the main reason why people see it in the first place: why, DINOSAURS, of course! Now, for a film starring DINOSAURS, actual dinosaurs only appear on screen for a total of 15 minutes. The brilliance of Jurassic Park is that, like Spielberg's JAWS, the entire movie is about the BUILD-UP to the dinosaurs, and about how we humans interact with them. Dinosaurs inhabited this planet for 150 million years, over 300 times longer than our species, Homo sapiens, has been around for. They were some of the largest and most magnificent creatures to ever grace Earth's natural history, and even after 65 million years of extinction, they continue to win the fascination and admiration of the human race the world over. Unlike many other movies that portray dinosaurs as mindless man-eating monsters, Jurassic Park actually takes great care to point out that dinosaurs are just animals like any other animal alive today - even the scary carnivores like the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a certain quality about it that you can't help but feel awed and fascinated by it even while you're running for your life! In a way, MAN is the true monster of the film, as it is man who believes himself above nature, and when man interferes with the natural order of the world, chaos and destruction ensues. For a Hollywood summer blockbuster, Jurassic Park is far more cleverly written than it has any right to be, but a lot of that is owed to writer Michael Crichton, that master of original and inventive science fiction stories. Rest in peace, Michael Crichton. Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ...

    A masterpiece of imagination, creativity, suspense, science & cinematic magic and a breathtaking sci-fi adventure that you'll want to experience again & again, Jurassic Park is a landmark motion picture that, today, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of its genre for it not only added an entirely new chapter to the filmmaking manual but also opened up a whole new world of possibilities in film industry with its groundbreaking use of computer graphics. The first film to realize the full potential of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Jurassic Park isn't just a dazzling visual ride that will leave you astonished but will also surprise you with its interesting plot, blistering pace, well-developed characters, rousing music & its significant emphasis on man vs nature element. Adapted from the novel of the same name, Jurassic Park follows two dinosaur experts, Dr. Alan Grant & Dr. Ellie Sattler, who are invited by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond, to a preview tour of his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. Accompanied by a cynical scientist, Ian Malcolm & Hammond's two grandchildren, they discover the island to be full of living dinosaurs, created by a team of genetic scientists from cloning the dinosaurs' DNA collected from biologically preserved prehistoric insects. Everything goes smooth until a storm hits the island & an inside worker allows system security to fail so that he can steal the dinosaurs' embryos for his own monetary motives, allowing the dinosaurs to go loose all over the island thus turning the adventure ride into a race of survival. Director Steven Spielberg has proved over & over again why he is one of the best storytellers in film industry with a rare cinematic vision that appeals to critics & mainstream audience alike. And with Jurassic Park, Spielberg delivers once again to give us an experience that's as entertaining as any typical blockbuster but has enough characterization & substance to rise above the mainstream & etch itself in our minds forever. Michael Crichton, author of the novel, nicely adapts his book into a movie screenplay with finishing touch added by screenwriter David Koepp, and even though the final script leaves out detailed science of cloning and makes significant changes to the plot as well as characters while also toning down the violence, it still manages to do enough for viewers to invest their emotions in this film. Coming to the technical aspects, Jurassic Park has innovation written all over it. The set pieces are impressive to look at. The cinematography is brilliantly done. Editing very much takes care of this film's swift pace. But the one aspect where this film sets a whole new standard is in its pioneering visual & sound effects. The dinosaurs on-screen look insanely real, both the CGI & animatronics ones, and the amount of detail that went into the creation of each dinosaur is remarkable. Sound also breaks all barriers, not only as dinosaurs' roars but overall too and Spielberg put it to great effect in driving our emotions the way he wanted. And finally, the music by John Williams synchronizes so seamlessly with the film's sequences that it ended up elevating the film's experience to new levels. Boasting beautiful, adventurous & heartwarming tracks that in some sequences felt truly epic, the score of Jurassic Park just works and is easily one of Williams' finest. Everyone who watched this film remembers its jaw-dropping special effects but the performances of the cast often gets overlooked. And true that it's not as spectacular as the film's technical achievements, but it did play a vital role nonetheless without which this film would've fallen flat on the ground. It's the human element in this film that connects us with it and makes Jurassic Park what it is; a rip-roaring, thrilling adventure ride. Jurassic Park features an ensemble cast of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson & others and everyone chipped in just enough with their fine performances. Sam Neill stars as palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant and on a deeper analysis, the movie is about his character only and depicts the changes the whole experience of Jurassic Park brings to his personality, thus slashing out the lack of story's motive & character development criticism because the arc of Dr. Grant is very well-developed here but, sadly, is overshadowed by the film's true stars the dinosaurs. Even after 20 years, Jurassic Park hasn't aged a day plus the recent 3D re-release has not only added a new dimension to this film but also depth. In spite of not having a strong script or any notable performances, there is a reason why this film still works. Because the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus scene still dazzles us in ways very few movies are capable of, eventually leaving us with an immense sense of joy & excitement for what's next in store. Overall, Jurassic Park is a movie that was tailor-made for the talents of Steven Spielberg and presents the master director in tremendous form as he not only gave us one of the greatest blockbusters ever but also thrilled us with one unforgettable sequence after another and it, even today, remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. Wonderfully blending the adventure elements with a sense of wonder & amazement that only a Spielberg film can provide, Jurassic Park continues to be one of the most influential films of all time that not only made significant contribution to cinema but also turned an entire generation of spectators into dinosaur-obsessed freaks (I'm still one of them!). The most special film of my life, Jurassic Park is the movie that started my love affair with movies. And I can never thank Spielberg enough for crafting this, 65 million years in the making, adventure.

    Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie with amazing special effects, good leads, and (I don't say this often) a tremendous score. When a park may be open on an island, so John Hammond brings a couple of dinosaur experts, a doctor, and a lawyer to the island to see if they'll endorse the park. But when there, things go wrong one night as the dinosaurs now roam the island freely and it's a fight for survival. This film has had some of the most impressive special effects for a few reasons: 1.) For its time, it really made audiences gasp at its wonder. It's still good compared to today, but even better then. 2.) The effects on the dinosaurs make them seem very real. This is the first movie and one of the only movies where the dinosaurs looked real and made the movie feel real in a way which is hard to do. The film has characters like Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and the children (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards). The film though has characters that are not as good which hurt the film a little like Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is there to be funny but sometimes he is an ass instead of funny, like some people in real life, and made things feel awkward at times, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), an expendable character who is there only to die, not be anything too important as all he does is judge the park and die, and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), the man who screws it up for money and is a fat, lazy, a-hole who is just a pain. He is supposed to be the bad guy and is, but is just too much a pain. This film has my favorite score ever as the film works perfectly into the movie, is peaceful and content and also heroic and bold. It is wonderful. This film is a terrific film that's beautiful to watch and is the same ever time I watch it. Me: A-

    Thanks to the 3D release I could watch this movie on a big screen again. A good movie should resist the passing of time, as in this case. It's visual effects still work, but the important thing is that the suspense still works. Spielberg's movies are always done by the book, and the fact that in this one he doesn't takes advantage of sentimentalism as shamelessly as usual improves the result. The only flaw (or the most significant) is the hilarious ending with the "heroic" T-Rex's appearance as a deus est machina and the falling flag. The best thing is the treatment of the "villain(s)", also by the book: we are told about the velociraptor since the beginning of the movie and it becomes a threatening presence that doesn't reveal itself until the second half of the movie. As in Jaws, things that we don't see are much more scary.

    Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.

    This movie is very original and I enjoyed it for the whole 127 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and the cast for this movie is great. The special effects for this movie were also great, especially the scene in the kitchen with Tim and Lex trying to get away from the Velociraptors. It has the same concept as the movie Tremors, except Jurassic Park is not a comedy. It is about a group of people that are invited to an island called Isla Nublar, which is filled with dinosaurs that were brought back to life. It all goes wrong when the dinosaurs escape and start to go after everybody. In the end, almost everybody gets back safely, but the island is still crawling with dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action packed sci-fi thriller:)

    I understand that the special effects and the originality of the underlying script justify some respect to this work. However the outcome of Mr Spielberg's efforts is nothing but annoying. Cheap thrills reiterating the horror of the "alien" beast and the holiness of the All- American family idol make this a pain to watch. How is a velociraptor transport and transfer device movable by a velociraptor? Why cant a T-Rex smell? Why is the rescue of a Multi-million dollar park left to 6 people suddenly all alone? Why is there no communication with Samuel L Jackson before he opens a bunker system to velociraptors which are hunting in a pack of three (two) outside and inside the bunker? The tears of sentiment brought to my eyes in the first scenes stating the extraordinary scientific achievement suggested are wasted to a dreamed up loss of control seemingly designed to reinstate our faith into the child-skeptic scientist who is "delivered" to be a family man. We are left with the notion "not to mess with god" who conveniently sends a T-Rex to solve our problems as we have confessed(?!). This is a disgrace for the thinking human being to be even considered a perceived reality- it is propaganda at best, destroying all the spirit other commentators might be tempted to mention in its favor. It "makes you think" just the wrong way. Be my guest to doubt the impact of genetic engineering (Monsanto) on existing ecosystems, but do it in a believable sound way, leaving out the Christian fear-mongering bullshit. One might say it is a fairytale alright but why does it try to be realistic when it is not? The notion that this should be voted over Schindler's List makes me cry.

    From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called " Jurassic Park. " Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****

    OK, is the plot that good? No. At least the set up isn't, it's cheesy monster movie stuff. Absolutely every bad decision that could be made generally is. Let's automate an entire park full of giant man eating dinosaurs in 1993. Then let's low ball the entire operation out to one guy. Then let's let the automation with thousands of bugs run the whole park before its ready. Then let's evacuate everyone because of a hurricane ensuring now one is there in case anything goes wrong, except about 10 people including the people inspecting the damned safety of the park for no reason. Then let's have the low balled guy screw everything up in the worst corporate robbery attempt ever by turning off every security system, stealing valuable goods, and just making a run for it onto the boat despite not being told to evacuate and him being the ONLY PERSON on the entire island that could've stolen the goods. And to top it off lets bash science in general as a main theme just because, despite science bringing the dinosaurs which is the entire thing that makes the plot cool to begin with. I know it's a movie, but at some point you begin to question the entire thing. But none of that makes more than a one star dent. Because you know what? The cast is just about absolutely perfect. Jeff Goldblum is so awesome in this movie it's ridiculous, same with Richard Attenborough. The rest of the cast is damned good, John Williams score soars as high as it ever has, and Spielberg is as on point in every shot and step of the way as he was with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The dialog has a weirdly memorable snap and flow to it that makes it as easily followable and memorable as movie like Star Wars: A New Hope and Pulp Fiction. And best of all, dinosaurs are awesome! No matter much progress was derided, no matter many people got eaten, you finish the movie thinking the same thing every time "Damn, seeing a real life dinosaur would be like the coolest most awesome thing EVER!" And that's why it's a must watch. It's just plain entertaining. It's fantastic, it's awesome. When you hear the word's "Welcome, to Jurassic Park" you'll feel like you're watching a real life dinosaur not ten feet in front of you, and that is one the most magical things you'll ever experience.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose... The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly.

This is the first movie and one of the only movies where the dinosaurs looked real and made the movie feel real in a way which is hard to do. The film has characters like Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and the children (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards). The film though has characters that are not as good which hurt the film a little like Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is there to be funny but sometimes he is an ass instead of funny, like some people in real life, and made things feel awkward at times, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), an expendable character who is there only to die, not be anything too important as all he does is judge the park and die, and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), the man who screws it up for money and is a fat, lazy, a-hole who is just a pain. He is supposed to be the bad guy and is, but is just too much a pain. This film has my favorite score ever as the film works perfectly into the movie, is peaceful and content and also heroic and bold. It is wonderful. This film is a terrific film that's beautiful to watch and is the same ever time I watch it. Me: A-

    Thanks to the 3D release I could watch this movie on a big screen again. A good movie should resist the passing of time, as in this case. It's visual effects still work, but the important thing is that the suspense still works. Spielberg's movies are always done by the book, and the fact that in this one he doesn't takes advantage of sentimentalism as shamelessly as usual improves the result. The only flaw (or the most significant) is the hilarious ending with the "heroic" T-Rex's appearance as a deus est machina and the falling flag. The best thing is the treatment of the "villain(s)", also by the book: we are told about the velociraptor since the beginning of the movie and it becomes a threatening presence that doesn't reveal itself until the second half of the movie. As in Jaws, things that we don't see are much more scary.

    Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.

    This movie is very original and I enjoyed it for the whole 127 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and the cast for this movie is great. The special effects for this movie were also great, especially the scene in the kitchen with Tim and Lex trying to get away from the Velociraptors. It has the same concept as the movie Tremors, except Jurassic Park is not a comedy. It is about a group of people that are invited to an island called Isla Nublar, which is filled with dinosaurs that were brought back to life. It all goes wrong when the dinosaurs escape and start to go after everybody. In the end, almost everybody gets back safely, but the island is still crawling with dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action packed sci-fi thriller:)

    I understand that the special effects and the originality of the underlying script justify some respect to this work. However the outcome of Mr Spielberg's efforts is nothing but annoying. Cheap thrills reiterating the horror of the "alien" beast and the holiness of the All- American family idol make this a pain to watch. How is a velociraptor transport and transfer device movable by a velociraptor? Why cant a T-Rex smell? Why is the rescue of a Multi-million dollar park left to 6 people suddenly all alone? Why is there no communication with Samuel L Jackson before he opens a bunker system to velociraptors which are hunting in a pack of three (two) outside and inside the bunker? The tears of sentiment brought to my eyes in the first scenes stating the extraordinary scientific achievement suggested are wasted to a dreamed up loss of control seemingly designed to reinstate our faith into the child-skeptic scientist who is "delivered" to be a family man. We are left with the notion "not to mess with god" who conveniently sends a T-Rex to solve our problems as we have confessed(?!). This is a disgrace for the thinking human being to be even considered a perceived reality- it is propaganda at best, destroying all the spirit other commentators might be tempted to mention in its favor. It "makes you think" just the wrong way. Be my guest to doubt the impact of genetic engineering (Monsanto) on existing ecosystems, but do it in a believable sound way, leaving out the Christian fear-mongering bullshit. One might say it is a fairytale alright but why does it try to be realistic when it is not? The notion that this should be voted over Schindler's List makes me cry.

    From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called " Jurassic Park. " Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****

    OK, is the plot that good? No. At least the set up isn't, it's cheesy monster movie stuff. Absolutely every bad decision that could be made generally is. Let's automate an entire park full of giant man eating dinosaurs in 1993. Then let's low ball the entire operation out to one guy. Then let's let the automation with thousands of bugs run the whole park before its ready. Then let's evacuate everyone because of a hurricane ensuring now one is there in case anything goes wrong, except about 10 people including the people inspecting the damned safety of the park for no reason. Then let's have the low balled guy screw everything up in the worst corporate robbery attempt ever by turning off every security system, stealing valuable goods, and just making a run for it onto the boat despite not being told to evacuate and him being the ONLY PERSON on the entire island that could've stolen the goods. And to top it off lets bash science in general as a main theme just because, despite science bringing the dinosaurs which is the entire thing that makes the plot cool to begin with. I know it's a movie, but at some point you begin to question the entire thing. But none of that makes more than a one star dent. Because you know what? The cast is just about absolutely perfect. Jeff Goldblum is so awesome in this movie it's ridiculous, same with Richard Attenborough. The rest of the cast is damned good, John Williams score soars as high as it ever has, and Spielberg is as on point in every shot and step of the way as he was with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The dialog has a weirdly memorable snap and flow to it that makes it as easily followable and memorable as movie like Star Wars: A New Hope and Pulp Fiction. And best of all, dinosaurs are awesome! No matter much progress was derided, no matter many people got eaten, you finish the movie thinking the same thing every time "Damn, seeing a real life dinosaur would be like the coolest most awesome thing EVER!" And that's why it's a must watch. It's just plain entertaining. It's fantastic, it's awesome. When you hear the word's "Welcome, to Jurassic Park" you'll feel like you're watching a real life dinosaur not ten feet in front of you, and that is one the most magical things you'll ever experience.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose... The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly.

    Few movies have had as great an impact on me as Jurassic Park the first time I saw this back in the 1990s as a little kid. This movie was not just a summer blockbuster, it was a pop culture PHENOMENON! I remember fondly those good ol' days, and the EXPLOSION of dinosaur toys, books, movies, TV shows, everything following in the wake of Jurassic Park. I recently had the pleasure of catching Jurassic Park once again on the big screen during the 20th Anniversary Rerelease. Let me begin by saying that Jurassic Park looks as beautiful and stunning on the big screen now as it did 20 years ago - even after so many years, even after Avatar and Inception and The Dark Knight, there is simply no experience that stacks up to seeing Jurassic Park on IMAX 3D! I can speak at great lengths as to the fantastic visual effects and sound work behind the film, the excellent directing by Steven Spielberg, the amazing soundtrack provided by John Williams (which may or may not rival those of Indiana Jones and Star Wars!), or the inspired acting performances by Sam Neil, Richard Attenborough, and, of course, the iconic "Must Go Faster!" Jeff Goldblum. But no, instead, I will focus on what I consider to be the REAL strength of this film, and the main reason why people see it in the first place: why, DINOSAURS, of course! Now, for a film starring DINOSAURS, actual dinosaurs only appear on screen for a total of 15 minutes. The brilliance of Jurassic Park is that, like Spielberg's JAWS, the entire movie is about the BUILD-UP to the dinosaurs, and about how we humans interact with them. Dinosaurs inhabited this planet for 150 million years, over 300 times longer than our species, Homo sapiens, has been around for. They were some of the largest and most magnificent creatures to ever grace Earth's natural history, and even after 65 million years of extinction, they continue to win the fascination and admiration of the human race the world over. Unlike many other movies that portray dinosaurs as mindless man-eating monsters, Jurassic Park actually takes great care to point out that dinosaurs are just animals like any other animal alive today - even the scary carnivores like the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a certain quality about it that you can't help but feel awed and fascinated by it even while you're running for your life! In a way, MAN is the true monster of the film, as it is man who believes himself above nature, and when man interferes with the natural order of the world, chaos and destruction ensues. For a Hollywood summer blockbuster, Jurassic Park is far more cleverly written than it has any right to be, but a lot of that is owed to writer Michael Crichton, that master of original and inventive science fiction stories. Rest in peace, Michael Crichton. Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ...

    A masterpiece of imagination, creativity, suspense, science & cinematic magic and a breathtaking sci-fi adventure that you'll want to experience again & again, Jurassic Park is a landmark motion picture that, today, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of its genre for it not only added an entirely new chapter to the filmmaking manual but also opened up a whole new world of possibilities in film industry with its groundbreaking use of computer graphics. The first film to realize the full potential of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Jurassic Park isn't just a dazzling visual ride that will leave you astonished but will also surprise you with its interesting plot, blistering pace, well-developed characters, rousing music & its significant emphasis on man vs nature element. Adapted from the novel of the same name, Jurassic Park follows two dinosaur experts, Dr. Alan Grant & Dr. Ellie Sattler, who are invited by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond, to a preview tour of his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. Accompanied by a cynical scientist, Ian Malcolm & Hammond's two grandchildren, they discover the island to be full of living dinosaurs, created by a team of genetic scientists from cloning the dinosaurs' DNA collected from biologically preserved prehistoric insects. Everything goes smooth until a storm hits the island & an inside worker allows system security to fail so that he can steal the dinosaurs' embryos for his own monetary motives, allowing the dinosaurs to go loose all over the island thus turning the adventure ride into a race of survival. Director Steven Spielberg has proved over & over again why he is one of the best storytellers in film industry with a rare cinematic vision that appeals to critics & mainstream audience alike. And with Jurassic Park, Spielberg delivers once again to give us an experience that's as entertaining as any typical blockbuster but has enough characterization & substance to rise above the mainstream & etch itself in our minds forever. Michael Crichton, author of the novel, nicely adapts his book into a movie screenplay with finishing touch added by screenwriter David Koepp, and even though the final script leaves out detailed science of cloning and makes significant changes to the plot as well as characters while also toning down the violence, it still manages to do enough for viewers to invest their emotions in this film. Coming to the technical aspects, Jurassic Park has innovation written all over it. The set pieces are impressive to look at. The cinematography is brilliantly done. Editing very much takes care of this film's swift pace. But the one aspect where this film sets a whole new standard is in its pioneering visual & sound effects. The dinosaurs on-screen look insanely real, both the CGI & animatronics ones, and the amount of detail that went into the creation of each dinosaur is remarkable. Sound also breaks all barriers, not only as dinosaurs' roars but overall too and Spielberg put it to great effect in driving our emotions the way he wanted. And finally, the music by John Williams synchronizes so seamlessly with the film's sequences that it ended up elevating the film's experience to new levels. Boasting beautiful, adventurous & heartwarming tracks that in some sequences felt truly epic, the score of Jurassic Park just works and is easily one of Williams' finest. Everyone who watched this film remembers its jaw-dropping special effects but the performances of the cast often gets overlooked. And true that it's not as spectacular as the film's technical achievements, but it did play a vital role nonetheless without which this film would've fallen flat on the ground. It's the human element in this film that connects us with it and makes Jurassic Park what it is; a rip-roaring, thrilling adventure ride. Jurassic Park features an ensemble cast of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson & others and everyone chipped in just enough with their fine performances. Sam Neill stars as palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant and on a deeper analysis, the movie is about his character only and depicts the changes the whole experience of Jurassic Park brings to his personality, thus slashing out the lack of story's motive & character development criticism because the arc of Dr. Grant is very well-developed here but, sadly, is overshadowed by the film's true stars the dinosaurs. Even after 20 years, Jurassic Park hasn't aged a day plus the recent 3D re-release has not only added a new dimension to this film but also depth. In spite of not having a strong script or any notable performances, there is a reason why this film still works. Because the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus scene still dazzles us in ways very few movies are capable of, eventually leaving us with an immense sense of joy & excitement for what's next in store. Overall, Jurassic Park is a movie that was tailor-made for the talents of Steven Spielberg and presents the master director in tremendous form as he not only gave us one of the greatest blockbusters ever but also thrilled us with one unforgettable sequence after another and it, even today, remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. Wonderfully blending the adventure elements with a sense of wonder & amazement that only a Spielberg film can provide, Jurassic Park continues to be one of the most influential films of all time that not only made significant contribution to cinema but also turned an entire generation of spectators into dinosaur-obsessed freaks (I'm still one of them!). The most special film of my life, Jurassic Park is the movie that started my love affair with movies. And I can never thank Spielberg enough for crafting this, 65 million years in the making, adventure.

    Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie with amazing special effects, good leads, and (I don't say this often) a tremendous score. When a park may be open on an island, so John Hammond brings a couple of dinosaur experts, a doctor, and a lawyer to the island to see if they'll endorse the park. But when there, things go wrong one night as the dinosaurs now roam the island freely and it's a fight for survival. This film has had some of the most impressive special effects for a few reasons: 1.) For its time, it really made audiences gasp at its wonder. It's still good compared to today, but even better then. 2.) The effects on the dinosaurs make them seem very real. This is the first movie and one of the only movies where the dinosaurs looked real and made the movie feel real in a way which is hard to do.

Then let's let the automation with thousands of bugs run the whole park before its ready. Then let's evacuate everyone because of a hurricane ensuring now one is there in case anything goes wrong, except about 10 people including the people inspecting the damned safety of the park for no reason. Then let's have the low balled guy screw everything up in the worst corporate robbery attempt ever by turning off every security system, stealing valuable goods, and just making a run for it onto the boat despite not being told to evacuate and him being the ONLY PERSON on the entire island that could've stolen the goods. And to top it off lets bash science in general as a main theme just because, despite science bringing the dinosaurs which is the entire thing that makes the plot cool to begin with. I know it's a movie, but at some point you begin to question the entire thing. But none of that makes more than a one star dent. Because you know what? The cast is just about absolutely perfect. Jeff Goldblum is so awesome in this movie it's ridiculous, same with Richard Attenborough. The rest of the cast is damned good, John Williams score soars as high as it ever has, and Spielberg is as on point in every shot and step of the way as he was with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The dialog has a weirdly memorable snap and flow to it that makes it as easily followable and memorable as movie like Star Wars: A New Hope and Pulp Fiction. And best of all, dinosaurs are awesome! No matter much progress was derided, no matter many people got eaten, you finish the movie thinking the same thing every time "Damn, seeing a real life dinosaur would be like the coolest most awesome thing EVER!" And that's why it's a must watch. It's just plain entertaining. It's fantastic, it's awesome. When you hear the word's "Welcome, to Jurassic Park" you'll feel like you're watching a real life dinosaur not ten feet in front of you, and that is one the most magical things you'll ever experience.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose... The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly.

    Few movies have had as great an impact on me as Jurassic Park the first time I saw this back in the 1990s as a little kid. This movie was not just a summer blockbuster, it was a pop culture PHENOMENON! I remember fondly those good ol' days, and the EXPLOSION of dinosaur toys, books, movies, TV shows, everything following in the wake of Jurassic Park. I recently had the pleasure of catching Jurassic Park once again on the big screen during the 20th Anniversary Rerelease. Let me begin by saying that Jurassic Park looks as beautiful and stunning on the big screen now as it did 20 years ago - even after so many years, even after Avatar and Inception and The Dark Knight, there is simply no experience that stacks up to seeing Jurassic Park on IMAX 3D! I can speak at great lengths as to the fantastic visual effects and sound work behind the film, the excellent directing by Steven Spielberg, the amazing soundtrack provided by John Williams (which may or may not rival those of Indiana Jones and Star Wars!), or the inspired acting performances by Sam Neil, Richard Attenborough, and, of course, the iconic "Must Go Faster!" Jeff Goldblum. But no, instead, I will focus on what I consider to be the REAL strength of this film, and the main reason why people see it in the first place: why, DINOSAURS, of course! Now, for a film starring DINOSAURS, actual dinosaurs only appear on screen for a total of 15 minutes. The brilliance of Jurassic Park is that, like Spielberg's JAWS, the entire movie is about the BUILD-UP to the dinosaurs, and about how we humans interact with them. Dinosaurs inhabited this planet for 150 million years, over 300 times longer than our species, Homo sapiens, has been around for. They were some of the largest and most magnificent creatures to ever grace Earth's natural history, and even after 65 million years of extinction, they continue to win the fascination and admiration of the human race the world over. Unlike many other movies that portray dinosaurs as mindless man-eating monsters, Jurassic Park actually takes great care to point out that dinosaurs are just animals like any other animal alive today - even the scary carnivores like the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a certain quality about it that you can't help but feel awed and fascinated by it even while you're running for your life! In a way, MAN is the true monster of the film, as it is man who believes himself above nature, and when man interferes with the natural order of the world, chaos and destruction ensues. For a Hollywood summer blockbuster, Jurassic Park is far more cleverly written than it has any right to be, but a lot of that is owed to writer Michael Crichton, that master of original and inventive science fiction stories. Rest in peace, Michael Crichton. Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ...

    A masterpiece of imagination, creativity, suspense, science & cinematic magic and a breathtaking sci-fi adventure that you'll want to experience again & again, Jurassic Park is a landmark motion picture that, today, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of its genre for it not only added an entirely new chapter to the filmmaking manual but also opened up a whole new world of possibilities in film industry with its groundbreaking use of computer graphics. The first film to realize the full potential of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Jurassic Park isn't just a dazzling visual ride that will leave you astonished but will also surprise you with its interesting plot, blistering pace, well-developed characters, rousing music & its significant emphasis on man vs nature element. Adapted from the novel of the same name, Jurassic Park follows two dinosaur experts, Dr. Alan Grant & Dr. Ellie Sattler, who are invited by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond, to a preview tour of his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. Accompanied by a cynical scientist, Ian Malcolm & Hammond's two grandchildren, they discover the island to be full of living dinosaurs, created by a team of genetic scientists from cloning the dinosaurs' DNA collected from biologically preserved prehistoric insects. Everything goes smooth until a storm hits the island & an inside worker allows system security to fail so that he can steal the dinosaurs' embryos for his own monetary motives, allowing the dinosaurs to go loose all over the island thus turning the adventure ride into a race of survival. Director Steven Spielberg has proved over & over again why he is one of the best storytellers in film industry with a rare cinematic vision that appeals to critics & mainstream audience alike. And with Jurassic Park, Spielberg delivers once again to give us an experience that's as entertaining as any typical blockbuster but has enough characterization & substance to rise above the mainstream & etch itself in our minds forever. Michael Crichton, author of the novel, nicely adapts his book into a movie screenplay with finishing touch added by screenwriter David Koepp, and even though the final script leaves out detailed science of cloning and makes significant changes to the plot as well as characters while also toning down the violence, it still manages to do enough for viewers to invest their emotions in this film. Coming to the technical aspects, Jurassic Park has innovation written all over it. The set pieces are impressive to look at. The cinematography is brilliantly done. Editing very much takes care of this film's swift pace. But the one aspect where this film sets a whole new standard is in its pioneering visual & sound effects. The dinosaurs on-screen look insanely real, both the CGI & animatronics ones, and the amount of detail that went into the creation of each dinosaur is remarkable. Sound also breaks all barriers, not only as dinosaurs' roars but overall too and Spielberg put it to great effect in driving our emotions the way he wanted. And finally, the music by John Williams synchronizes so seamlessly with the film's sequences that it ended up elevating the film's experience to new levels. Boasting beautiful, adventurous & heartwarming tracks that in some sequences felt truly epic, the score of Jurassic Park just works and is easily one of Williams' finest. Everyone who watched this film remembers its jaw-dropping special effects but the performances of the cast often gets overlooked. And true that it's not as spectacular as the film's technical achievements, but it did play a vital role nonetheless without which this film would've fallen flat on the ground. It's the human element in this film that connects us with it and makes Jurassic Park what it is; a rip-roaring, thrilling adventure ride. Jurassic Park features an ensemble cast of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson & others and everyone chipped in just enough with their fine performances. Sam Neill stars as palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant and on a deeper analysis, the movie is about his character only and depicts the changes the whole experience of Jurassic Park brings to his personality, thus slashing out the lack of story's motive & character development criticism because the arc of Dr. Grant is very well-developed here but, sadly, is overshadowed by the film's true stars the dinosaurs. Even after 20 years, Jurassic Park hasn't aged a day plus the recent 3D re-release has not only added a new dimension to this film but also depth. In spite of not having a strong script or any notable performances, there is a reason why this film still works. Because the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus scene still dazzles us in ways very few movies are capable of, eventually leaving us with an immense sense of joy & excitement for what's next in store. Overall, Jurassic Park is a movie that was tailor-made for the talents of Steven Spielberg and presents the master director in tremendous form as he not only gave us one of the greatest blockbusters ever but also thrilled us with one unforgettable sequence after another and it, even today, remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. Wonderfully blending the adventure elements with a sense of wonder & amazement that only a Spielberg film can provide, Jurassic Park continues to be one of the most influential films of all time that not only made significant contribution to cinema but also turned an entire generation of spectators into dinosaur-obsessed freaks (I'm still one of them!). The most special film of my life, Jurassic Park is the movie that started my love affair with movies. And I can never thank Spielberg enough for crafting this, 65 million years in the making, adventure.

    Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie with amazing special effects, good leads, and (I don't say this often) a tremendous score. When a park may be open on an island, so John Hammond brings a couple of dinosaur experts, a doctor, and a lawyer to the island to see if they'll endorse the park. But when there, things go wrong one night as the dinosaurs now roam the island freely and it's a fight for survival. This film has had some of the most impressive special effects for a few reasons: 1.) For its time, it really made audiences gasp at its wonder. It's still good compared to today, but even better then. 2.) The effects on the dinosaurs make them seem very real. This is the first movie and one of the only movies where the dinosaurs looked real and made the movie feel real in a way which is hard to do. The film has characters like Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and the children (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards). The film though has characters that are not as good which hurt the film a little like Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is there to be funny but sometimes he is an ass instead of funny, like some people in real life, and made things feel awkward at times, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), an expendable character who is there only to die, not be anything too important as all he does is judge the park and die, and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), the man who screws it up for money and is a fat, lazy, a-hole who is just a pain. He is supposed to be the bad guy and is, but is just too much a pain. This film has my favorite score ever as the film works perfectly into the movie, is peaceful and content and also heroic and bold. It is wonderful. This film is a terrific film that's beautiful to watch and is the same ever time I watch it. Me: A-

    Thanks to the 3D release I could watch this movie on a big screen again. A good movie should resist the passing of time, as in this case. It's visual effects still work, but the important thing is that the suspense still works. Spielberg's movies are always done by the book, and the fact that in this one he doesn't takes advantage of sentimentalism as shamelessly as usual improves the result. The only flaw (or the most significant) is the hilarious ending with the "heroic" T-Rex's appearance as a deus est machina and the falling flag. The best thing is the treatment of the "villain(s)", also by the book: we are told about the velociraptor since the beginning of the movie and it becomes a threatening presence that doesn't reveal itself until the second half of the movie. As in Jaws, things that we don't see are much more scary.

    Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.

    This movie is very original and I enjoyed it for the whole 127 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and the cast for this movie is great. The special effects for this movie were also great, especially the scene in the kitchen with Tim and Lex trying to get away from the Velociraptors. It has the same concept as the movie Tremors, except Jurassic Park is not a comedy. It is about a group of people that are invited to an island called Isla Nublar, which is filled with dinosaurs that were brought back to life. It all goes wrong when the dinosaurs escape and start to go after everybody. In the end, almost everybody gets back safely, but the island is still crawling with dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action packed sci-fi thriller:)

    I understand that the special effects and the originality of the underlying script justify some respect to this work. However the outcome of Mr Spielberg's efforts is nothing but annoying. Cheap thrills reiterating the horror of the "alien" beast and the holiness of the All- American family idol make this a pain to watch. How is a velociraptor transport and transfer device movable by a velociraptor? Why cant a T-Rex smell? Why is the rescue of a Multi-million dollar park left to 6 people suddenly all alone? Why is there no communication with Samuel L Jackson before he opens a bunker system to velociraptors which are hunting in a pack of three (two) outside and inside the bunker? The tears of sentiment brought to my eyes in the first scenes stating the extraordinary scientific achievement suggested are wasted to a dreamed up loss of control seemingly designed to reinstate our faith into the child-skeptic scientist who is "delivered" to be a family man. We are left with the notion "not to mess with god" who conveniently sends a T-Rex to solve our problems as we have confessed(?!). This is a disgrace for the thinking human being to be even considered a perceived reality- it is propaganda at best, destroying all the spirit other commentators might be tempted to mention in its favor. It "makes you think" just the wrong way. Be my guest to doubt the impact of genetic engineering (Monsanto) on existing ecosystems, but do it in a believable sound way, leaving out the Christian fear-mongering bullshit. One might say it is a fairytale alright but why does it try to be realistic when it is not? The notion that this should be voted over Schindler's List makes me cry.

    From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called " Jurassic Park. " Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****

And finally, the music by John Williams synchronizes so seamlessly with the film's sequences that it ended up elevating the film's experience to new levels. Boasting beautiful, adventurous & heartwarming tracks that in some sequences felt truly epic, the score of Jurassic Park just works and is easily one of Williams' finest. Everyone who watched this film remembers its jaw-dropping special effects but the performances of the cast often gets overlooked. And true that it's not as spectacular as the film's technical achievements, but it did play a vital role nonetheless without which this film would've fallen flat on the ground. It's the human element in this film that connects us with it and makes Jurassic Park what it is; a rip-roaring, thrilling adventure ride. Jurassic Park features an ensemble cast of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson & others and everyone chipped in just enough with their fine performances. Sam Neill stars as palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant and on a deeper analysis, the movie is about his character only and depicts the changes the whole experience of Jurassic Park brings to his personality, thus slashing out the lack of story's motive & character development criticism because the arc of Dr. Grant is very well-developed here but, sadly, is overshadowed by the film's true stars the dinosaurs. Even after 20 years, Jurassic Park hasn't aged a day plus the recent 3D re-release has not only added a new dimension to this film but also depth. In spite of not having a strong script or any notable performances, there is a reason why this film still works. Because the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus scene still dazzles us in ways very few movies are capable of, eventually leaving us with an immense sense of joy & excitement for what's next in store. Overall, Jurassic Park is a movie that was tailor-made for the talents of Steven Spielberg and presents the master director in tremendous form as he not only gave us one of the greatest blockbusters ever but also thrilled us with one unforgettable sequence after another and it, even today, remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. Wonderfully blending the adventure elements with a sense of wonder & amazement that only a Spielberg film can provide, Jurassic Park continues to be one of the most influential films of all time that not only made significant contribution to cinema but also turned an entire generation of spectators into dinosaur-obsessed freaks (I'm still one of them!). The most special film of my life, Jurassic Park is the movie that started my love affair with movies. And I can never thank Spielberg enough for crafting this, 65 million years in the making, adventure.

    Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie with amazing special effects, good leads, and (I don't say this often) a tremendous score. When a park may be open on an island, so John Hammond brings a couple of dinosaur experts, a doctor, and a lawyer to the island to see if they'll endorse the park. But when there, things go wrong one night as the dinosaurs now roam the island freely and it's a fight for survival. This film has had some of the most impressive special effects for a few reasons: 1.) For its time, it really made audiences gasp at its wonder. It's still good compared to today, but even better then. 2.) The effects on the dinosaurs make them seem very real. This is the first movie and one of the only movies where the dinosaurs looked real and made the movie feel real in a way which is hard to do. The film has characters like Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and the children (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards). The film though has characters that are not as good which hurt the film a little like Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is there to be funny but sometimes he is an ass instead of funny, like some people in real life, and made things feel awkward at times, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), an expendable character who is there only to die, not be anything too important as all he does is judge the park and die, and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), the man who screws it up for money and is a fat, lazy, a-hole who is just a pain. He is supposed to be the bad guy and is, but is just too much a pain. This film has my favorite score ever as the film works perfectly into the movie, is peaceful and content and also heroic and bold. It is wonderful. This film is a terrific film that's beautiful to watch and is the same ever time I watch it. Me: A-

    Thanks to the 3D release I could watch this movie on a big screen again. A good movie should resist the passing of time, as in this case. It's visual effects still work, but the important thing is that the suspense still works. Spielberg's movies are always done by the book, and the fact that in this one he doesn't takes advantage of sentimentalism as shamelessly as usual improves the result. The only flaw (or the most significant) is the hilarious ending with the "heroic" T-Rex's appearance as a deus est machina and the falling flag. The best thing is the treatment of the "villain(s)", also by the book: we are told about the velociraptor since the beginning of the movie and it becomes a threatening presence that doesn't reveal itself until the second half of the movie. As in Jaws, things that we don't see are much more scary.

    Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.

    This movie is very original and I enjoyed it for the whole 127 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and the cast for this movie is great. The special effects for this movie were also great, especially the scene in the kitchen with Tim and Lex trying to get away from the Velociraptors. It has the same concept as the movie Tremors, except Jurassic Park is not a comedy. It is about a group of people that are invited to an island called Isla Nublar, which is filled with dinosaurs that were brought back to life. It all goes wrong when the dinosaurs escape and start to go after everybody. In the end, almost everybody gets back safely, but the island is still crawling with dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action packed sci-fi thriller:)

    I understand that the special effects and the originality of the underlying script justify some respect to this work. However the outcome of Mr Spielberg's efforts is nothing but annoying. Cheap thrills reiterating the horror of the "alien" beast and the holiness of the All- American family idol make this a pain to watch. How is a velociraptor transport and transfer device movable by a velociraptor? Why cant a T-Rex smell? Why is the rescue of a Multi-million dollar park left to 6 people suddenly all alone? Why is there no communication with Samuel L Jackson before he opens a bunker system to velociraptors which are hunting in a pack of three (two) outside and inside the bunker? The tears of sentiment brought to my eyes in the first scenes stating the extraordinary scientific achievement suggested are wasted to a dreamed up loss of control seemingly designed to reinstate our faith into the child-skeptic scientist who is "delivered" to be a family man. We are left with the notion "not to mess with god" who conveniently sends a T-Rex to solve our problems as we have confessed(?!). This is a disgrace for the thinking human being to be even considered a perceived reality- it is propaganda at best, destroying all the spirit other commentators might be tempted to mention in its favor. It "makes you think" just the wrong way. Be my guest to doubt the impact of genetic engineering (Monsanto) on existing ecosystems, but do it in a believable sound way, leaving out the Christian fear-mongering bullshit. One might say it is a fairytale alright but why does it try to be realistic when it is not? The notion that this should be voted over Schindler's List makes me cry.

    From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called " Jurassic Park. " Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****

    OK, is the plot that good? No. At least the set up isn't, it's cheesy monster movie stuff. Absolutely every bad decision that could be made generally is. Let's automate an entire park full of giant man eating dinosaurs in 1993. Then let's low ball the entire operation out to one guy. Then let's let the automation with thousands of bugs run the whole park before its ready. Then let's evacuate everyone because of a hurricane ensuring now one is there in case anything goes wrong, except about 10 people including the people inspecting the damned safety of the park for no reason. Then let's have the low balled guy screw everything up in the worst corporate robbery attempt ever by turning off every security system, stealing valuable goods, and just making a run for it onto the boat despite not being told to evacuate and him being the ONLY PERSON on the entire island that could've stolen the goods. And to top it off lets bash science in general as a main theme just because, despite science bringing the dinosaurs which is the entire thing that makes the plot cool to begin with. I know it's a movie, but at some point you begin to question the entire thing. But none of that makes more than a one star dent. Because you know what? The cast is just about absolutely perfect. Jeff Goldblum is so awesome in this movie it's ridiculous, same with Richard Attenborough. The rest of the cast is damned good, John Williams score soars as high as it ever has, and Spielberg is as on point in every shot and step of the way as he was with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The dialog has a weirdly memorable snap and flow to it that makes it as easily followable and memorable as movie like Star Wars: A New Hope and Pulp Fiction. And best of all, dinosaurs are awesome! No matter much progress was derided, no matter many people got eaten, you finish the movie thinking the same thing every time "Damn, seeing a real life dinosaur would be like the coolest most awesome thing EVER!" And that's why it's a must watch. It's just plain entertaining. It's fantastic, it's awesome. When you hear the word's "Welcome, to Jurassic Park" you'll feel like you're watching a real life dinosaur not ten feet in front of you, and that is one the most magical things you'll ever experience.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose... The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly.

    Few movies have had as great an impact on me as Jurassic Park the first time I saw this back in the 1990s as a little kid. This movie was not just a summer blockbuster, it was a pop culture PHENOMENON! I remember fondly those good ol' days, and the EXPLOSION of dinosaur toys, books, movies, TV shows, everything following in the wake of Jurassic Park. I recently had the pleasure of catching Jurassic Park once again on the big screen during the 20th Anniversary Rerelease. Let me begin by saying that Jurassic Park looks as beautiful and stunning on the big screen now as it did 20 years ago - even after so many years, even after Avatar and Inception and The Dark Knight, there is simply no experience that stacks up to seeing Jurassic Park on IMAX 3D! I can speak at great lengths as to the fantastic visual effects and sound work behind the film, the excellent directing by Steven Spielberg, the amazing soundtrack provided by John Williams (which may or may not rival those of Indiana Jones and Star Wars!), or the inspired acting performances by Sam Neil, Richard Attenborough, and, of course, the iconic "Must Go Faster!" Jeff Goldblum. But no, instead, I will focus on what I consider to be the REAL strength of this film, and the main reason why people see it in the first place: why, DINOSAURS, of course! Now, for a film starring DINOSAURS, actual dinosaurs only appear on screen for a total of 15 minutes. The brilliance of Jurassic Park is that, like Spielberg's JAWS, the entire movie is about the BUILD-UP to the dinosaurs, and about how we humans interact with them. Dinosaurs inhabited this planet for 150 million years, over 300 times longer than our species, Homo sapiens, has been around for. They were some of the largest and most magnificent creatures to ever grace Earth's natural history, and even after 65 million years of extinction, they continue to win the fascination and admiration of the human race the world over. Unlike many other movies that portray dinosaurs as mindless man-eating monsters, Jurassic Park actually takes great care to point out that dinosaurs are just animals like any other animal alive today - even the scary carnivores like the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a certain quality about it that you can't help but feel awed and fascinated by it even while you're running for your life! In a way, MAN is the true monster of the film, as it is man who believes himself above nature, and when man interferes with the natural order of the world, chaos and destruction ensues. For a Hollywood summer blockbuster, Jurassic Park is far more cleverly written than it has any right to be, but a lot of that is owed to writer Michael Crichton, that master of original and inventive science fiction stories. Rest in peace, Michael Crichton. Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ...

    A masterpiece of imagination, creativity, suspense, science & cinematic magic and a breathtaking sci-fi adventure that you'll want to experience again & again, Jurassic Park is a landmark motion picture that, today, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of its genre for it not only added an entirely new chapter to the filmmaking manual but also opened up a whole new world of possibilities in film industry with its groundbreaking use of computer graphics. The first film to realize the full potential of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Jurassic Park isn't just a dazzling visual ride that will leave you astonished but will also surprise you with its interesting plot, blistering pace, well-developed characters, rousing music & its significant emphasis on man vs nature element. Adapted from the novel of the same name, Jurassic Park follows two dinosaur experts, Dr. Alan Grant & Dr. Ellie Sattler, who are invited by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond, to a preview tour of his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. Accompanied by a cynical scientist, Ian Malcolm & Hammond's two grandchildren, they discover the island to be full of living dinosaurs, created by a team of genetic scientists from cloning the dinosaurs' DNA collected from biologically preserved prehistoric insects. Everything goes smooth until a storm hits the island & an inside worker allows system security to fail so that he can steal the dinosaurs' embryos for his own monetary motives, allowing the dinosaurs to go loose all over the island thus turning the adventure ride into a race of survival. Director Steven Spielberg has proved over & over again why he is one of the best storytellers in film industry with a rare cinematic vision that appeals to critics & mainstream audience alike. And with Jurassic Park, Spielberg delivers once again to give us an experience that's as entertaining as any typical blockbuster but has enough characterization & substance to rise above the mainstream & etch itself in our minds forever. Michael Crichton, author of the novel, nicely adapts his book into a movie screenplay with finishing touch added by screenwriter David Koepp, and even though the final script leaves out detailed science of cloning and makes significant changes to the plot as well as characters while also toning down the violence, it still manages to do enough for viewers to invest their emotions in this film. Coming to the technical aspects, Jurassic Park has innovation written all over it. The set pieces are impressive to look at. The cinematography is brilliantly done. Editing very much takes care of this film's swift pace. But the one aspect where this film sets a whole new standard is in its pioneering visual & sound effects. The dinosaurs on-screen look insanely real, both the CGI & animatronics ones, and the amount of detail that went into the creation of each dinosaur is remarkable. Sound also breaks all barriers, not only as dinosaurs' roars but overall too and Spielberg put it to great effect in driving our emotions the way he wanted. And finally, the music by John Williams synchronizes so seamlessly with the film's sequences that it ended up elevating the film's experience to new levels. Boasting beautiful, adventurous & heartwarming tracks that in some sequences felt truly epic, the score of Jurassic Park just works and is easily one of Williams' finest. Everyone who watched this film remembers its jaw-dropping special effects but the performances of the cast often gets overlooked. And true that it's not as spectacular as the film's technical achievements, but it did play a vital role nonetheless without which this film would've fallen flat on the ground. It's the human element in this film that connects us with it and makes Jurassic Park what it is; a rip-roaring, thrilling adventure ride. Jurassic Park features an ensemble cast of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson & others and everyone chipped in just enough with their fine performances. Sam Neill stars as palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant and on a deeper analysis, the movie is about his character only and depicts the changes the whole experience of Jurassic Park brings to his personality, thus slashing out the lack of story's motive & character development criticism because the arc of Dr. Grant is very well-developed here but, sadly, is overshadowed by the film's true stars the dinosaurs. Even after 20 years, Jurassic Park hasn't aged a day plus the recent 3D re-release has not only added a new dimension to this film but also depth. In spite of not having a strong script or any notable performances, there is a reason why this film still works. Because the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus scene still dazzles us in ways very few movies are capable of, eventually leaving us with an immense sense of joy & excitement for what's next in store. Overall, Jurassic Park is a movie that was tailor-made for the talents of Steven Spielberg and presents the master director in tremendous form as he not only gave us one of the greatest blockbusters ever but also thrilled us with one unforgettable sequence after another and it, even today, remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films.

The most special film of my life, Jurassic Park is the movie that started my love affair with movies.

The tears of sentiment brought to my eyes in the first scenes stating the extraordinary scientific achievement suggested are wasted to a dreamed up loss of control seemingly designed to reinstate our faith into the child-skeptic scientist who is "delivered" to be a family man. We are left with the notion "not to mess with god" who conveniently sends a T-Rex to solve our problems as we have confessed(?!). This is a disgrace for the thinking human being to be even considered a perceived reality- it is propaganda at best, destroying all the spirit other commentators might be tempted to mention in its favor. It "makes you think" just the wrong way. Be my guest to doubt the impact of genetic engineering (Monsanto) on existing ecosystems, but do it in a believable sound way, leaving out the Christian fear-mongering bullshit. One might say it is a fairytale alright but why does it try to be realistic when it is not? The notion that this should be voted over Schindler's List makes me cry.

    From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called " Jurassic Park. " Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****

    OK, is the plot that good? No. At least the set up isn't, it's cheesy monster movie stuff. Absolutely every bad decision that could be made generally is. Let's automate an entire park full of giant man eating dinosaurs in 1993. Then let's low ball the entire operation out to one guy. Then let's let the automation with thousands of bugs run the whole park before its ready. Then let's evacuate everyone because of a hurricane ensuring now one is there in case anything goes wrong, except about 10 people including the people inspecting the damned safety of the park for no reason. Then let's have the low balled guy screw everything up in the worst corporate robbery attempt ever by turning off every security system, stealing valuable goods, and just making a run for it onto the boat despite not being told to evacuate and him being the ONLY PERSON on the entire island that could've stolen the goods. And to top it off lets bash science in general as a main theme just because, despite science bringing the dinosaurs which is the entire thing that makes the plot cool to begin with. I know it's a movie, but at some point you begin to question the entire thing. But none of that makes more than a one star dent. Because you know what? The cast is just about absolutely perfect. Jeff Goldblum is so awesome in this movie it's ridiculous, same with Richard Attenborough. The rest of the cast is damned good, John Williams score soars as high as it ever has, and Spielberg is as on point in every shot and step of the way as he was with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The dialog has a weirdly memorable snap and flow to it that makes it as easily followable and memorable as movie like Star Wars: A New Hope and Pulp Fiction. And best of all, dinosaurs are awesome! No matter much progress was derided, no matter many people got eaten, you finish the movie thinking the same thing every time "Damn, seeing a real life dinosaur would be like the coolest most awesome thing EVER!" And that's why it's a must watch. It's just plain entertaining. It's fantastic, it's awesome. When you hear the word's "Welcome, to Jurassic Park" you'll feel like you're watching a real life dinosaur not ten feet in front of you, and that is one the most magical things you'll ever experience.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose... The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly.

    Few movies have had as great an impact on me as Jurassic Park the first time I saw this back in the 1990s as a little kid. This movie was not just a summer blockbuster, it was a pop culture PHENOMENON! I remember fondly those good ol' days, and the EXPLOSION of dinosaur toys, books, movies, TV shows, everything following in the wake of Jurassic Park. I recently had the pleasure of catching Jurassic Park once again on the big screen during the 20th Anniversary Rerelease. Let me begin by saying that Jurassic Park looks as beautiful and stunning on the big screen now as it did 20 years ago - even after so many years, even after Avatar and Inception and The Dark Knight, there is simply no experience that stacks up to seeing Jurassic Park on IMAX 3D! I can speak at great lengths as to the fantastic visual effects and sound work behind the film, the excellent directing by Steven Spielberg, the amazing soundtrack provided by John Williams (which may or may not rival those of Indiana Jones and Star Wars!), or the inspired acting performances by Sam Neil, Richard Attenborough, and, of course, the iconic "Must Go Faster!" Jeff Goldblum. But no, instead, I will focus on what I consider to be the REAL strength of this film, and the main reason why people see it in the first place: why, DINOSAURS, of course! Now, for a film starring DINOSAURS, actual dinosaurs only appear on screen for a total of 15 minutes. The brilliance of Jurassic Park is that, like Spielberg's JAWS, the entire movie is about the BUILD-UP to the dinosaurs, and about how we humans interact with them. Dinosaurs inhabited this planet for 150 million years, over 300 times longer than our species, Homo sapiens, has been around for. They were some of the largest and most magnificent creatures to ever grace Earth's natural history, and even after 65 million years of extinction, they continue to win the fascination and admiration of the human race the world over. Unlike many other movies that portray dinosaurs as mindless man-eating monsters, Jurassic Park actually takes great care to point out that dinosaurs are just animals like any other animal alive today - even the scary carnivores like the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a certain quality about it that you can't help but feel awed and fascinated by it even while you're running for your life! In a way, MAN is the true monster of the film, as it is man who believes himself above nature, and when man interferes with the natural order of the world, chaos and destruction ensues. For a Hollywood summer blockbuster, Jurassic Park is far more cleverly written than it has any right to be, but a lot of that is owed to writer Michael Crichton, that master of original and inventive science fiction stories. Rest in peace, Michael Crichton. Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ...

    A masterpiece of imagination, creativity, suspense, science & cinematic magic and a breathtaking sci-fi adventure that you'll want to experience again & again, Jurassic Park is a landmark motion picture that, today, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of its genre for it not only added an entirely new chapter to the filmmaking manual but also opened up a whole new world of possibilities in film industry with its groundbreaking use of computer graphics. The first film to realize the full potential of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Jurassic Park isn't just a dazzling visual ride that will leave you astonished but will also surprise you with its interesting plot, blistering pace, well-developed characters, rousing music & its significant emphasis on man vs nature element. Adapted from the novel of the same name, Jurassic Park follows two dinosaur experts, Dr. Alan Grant & Dr. Ellie Sattler, who are invited by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond, to a preview tour of his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. Accompanied by a cynical scientist, Ian Malcolm & Hammond's two grandchildren, they discover the island to be full of living dinosaurs, created by a team of genetic scientists from cloning the dinosaurs' DNA collected from biologically preserved prehistoric insects. Everything goes smooth until a storm hits the island & an inside worker allows system security to fail so that he can steal the dinosaurs' embryos for his own monetary motives, allowing the dinosaurs to go loose all over the island thus turning the adventure ride into a race of survival. Director Steven Spielberg has proved over & over again why he is one of the best storytellers in film industry with a rare cinematic vision that appeals to critics & mainstream audience alike. And with Jurassic Park, Spielberg delivers once again to give us an experience that's as entertaining as any typical blockbuster but has enough characterization & substance to rise above the mainstream & etch itself in our minds forever. Michael Crichton, author of the novel, nicely adapts his book into a movie screenplay with finishing touch added by screenwriter David Koepp, and even though the final script leaves out detailed science of cloning and makes significant changes to the plot as well as characters while also toning down the violence, it still manages to do enough for viewers to invest their emotions in this film. Coming to the technical aspects, Jurassic Park has innovation written all over it. The set pieces are impressive to look at. The cinematography is brilliantly done. Editing very much takes care of this film's swift pace. But the one aspect where this film sets a whole new standard is in its pioneering visual & sound effects. The dinosaurs on-screen look insanely real, both the CGI & animatronics ones, and the amount of detail that went into the creation of each dinosaur is remarkable. Sound also breaks all barriers, not only as dinosaurs' roars but overall too and Spielberg put it to great effect in driving our emotions the way he wanted. And finally, the music by John Williams synchronizes so seamlessly with the film's sequences that it ended up elevating the film's experience to new levels. Boasting beautiful, adventurous & heartwarming tracks that in some sequences felt truly epic, the score of Jurassic Park just works and is easily one of Williams' finest. Everyone who watched this film remembers its jaw-dropping special effects but the performances of the cast often gets overlooked. And true that it's not as spectacular as the film's technical achievements, but it did play a vital role nonetheless without which this film would've fallen flat on the ground. It's the human element in this film that connects us with it and makes Jurassic Park what it is; a rip-roaring, thrilling adventure ride. Jurassic Park features an ensemble cast of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson & others and everyone chipped in just enough with their fine performances. Sam Neill stars as palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant and on a deeper analysis, the movie is about his character only and depicts the changes the whole experience of Jurassic Park brings to his personality, thus slashing out the lack of story's motive & character development criticism because the arc of Dr. Grant is very well-developed here but, sadly, is overshadowed by the film's true stars the dinosaurs. Even after 20 years, Jurassic Park hasn't aged a day plus the recent 3D re-release has not only added a new dimension to this film but also depth. In spite of not having a strong script or any notable performances, there is a reason why this film still works. Because the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus scene still dazzles us in ways very few movies are capable of, eventually leaving us with an immense sense of joy & excitement for what's next in store. Overall, Jurassic Park is a movie that was tailor-made for the talents of Steven Spielberg and presents the master director in tremendous form as he not only gave us one of the greatest blockbusters ever but also thrilled us with one unforgettable sequence after another and it, even today, remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. Wonderfully blending the adventure elements with a sense of wonder & amazement that only a Spielberg film can provide, Jurassic Park continues to be one of the most influential films of all time that not only made significant contribution to cinema but also turned an entire generation of spectators into dinosaur-obsessed freaks (I'm still one of them!). The most special film of my life, Jurassic Park is the movie that started my love affair with movies. And I can never thank Spielberg enough for crafting this, 65 million years in the making, adventure.

    Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie with amazing special effects, good leads, and (I don't say this often) a tremendous score. When a park may be open on an island, so John Hammond brings a couple of dinosaur experts, a doctor, and a lawyer to the island to see if they'll endorse the park. But when there, things go wrong one night as the dinosaurs now roam the island freely and it's a fight for survival. This film has had some of the most impressive special effects for a few reasons: 1.) For its time, it really made audiences gasp at its wonder. It's still good compared to today, but even better then. 2.) The effects on the dinosaurs make them seem very real. This is the first movie and one of the only movies where the dinosaurs looked real and made the movie feel real in a way which is hard to do. The film has characters like Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and the children (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards). The film though has characters that are not as good which hurt the film a little like Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is there to be funny but sometimes he is an ass instead of funny, like some people in real life, and made things feel awkward at times, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), an expendable character who is there only to die, not be anything too important as all he does is judge the park and die, and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), the man who screws it up for money and is a fat, lazy, a-hole who is just a pain. He is supposed to be the bad guy and is, but is just too much a pain. This film has my favorite score ever as the film works perfectly into the movie, is peaceful and content and also heroic and bold. It is wonderful. This film is a terrific film that's beautiful to watch and is the same ever time I watch it. Me: A-

    Thanks to the 3D release I could watch this movie on a big screen again. A good movie should resist the passing of time, as in this case. It's visual effects still work, but the important thing is that the suspense still works. Spielberg's movies are always done by the book, and the fact that in this one he doesn't takes advantage of sentimentalism as shamelessly as usual improves the result. The only flaw (or the most significant) is the hilarious ending with the "heroic" T-Rex's appearance as a deus est machina and the falling flag. The best thing is the treatment of the "villain(s)", also by the book: we are told about the velociraptor since the beginning of the movie and it becomes a threatening presence that doesn't reveal itself until the second half of the movie. As in Jaws, things that we don't see are much more scary.

    Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.

    This movie is very original and I enjoyed it for the whole 127 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and the cast for this movie is great. The special effects for this movie were also great, especially the scene in the kitchen with Tim and Lex trying to get away from the Velociraptors. It has the same concept as the movie Tremors, except Jurassic Park is not a comedy. It is about a group of people that are invited to an island called Isla Nublar, which is filled with dinosaurs that were brought back to life. It all goes wrong when the dinosaurs escape and start to go after everybody. In the end, almost everybody gets back safely, but the island is still crawling with dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action packed sci-fi thriller:)

    I understand that the special effects and the originality of the underlying script justify some respect to this work. However the outcome of Mr Spielberg's efforts is nothing but annoying. Cheap thrills reiterating the horror of the "alien" beast and the holiness of the All- American family idol make this a pain to watch. How is a velociraptor transport and transfer device movable by a velociraptor? Why cant a T-Rex smell? Why is the rescue of a Multi-million dollar park left to 6 people suddenly all alone? Why is there no communication with Samuel L Jackson before he opens a bunker system to velociraptors which are hunting in a pack of three (two) outside and inside the bunker? The tears of sentiment brought to my eyes in the first scenes stating the extraordinary scientific achievement suggested are wasted to a dreamed up loss of control seemingly designed to reinstate our faith into the child-skeptic scientist who is "delivered" to be a family man. We are left with the notion "not to mess with god" who conveniently sends a T-Rex to solve our problems as we have confessed(?!). This is a disgrace for the thinking human being to be even considered a perceived reality- it is propaganda at best, destroying all the spirit other commentators might be tempted to mention in its favor. It "makes you think" just the wrong way. Be my guest to doubt the impact of genetic engineering (Monsanto) on existing ecosystems, but do it in a believable sound way, leaving out the Christian fear-mongering bullshit. One might say it is a fairytale alright but why does it try to be realistic when it is not? The notion that this should be voted over Schindler's List makes me cry.

Rest in peace, Michael Crichton. Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ...

    A masterpiece of imagination, creativity, suspense, science & cinematic magic and a breathtaking sci-fi adventure that you'll want to experience again & again, Jurassic Park is a landmark motion picture that, today, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of its genre for it not only added an entirely new chapter to the filmmaking manual but also opened up a whole new world of possibilities in film industry with its groundbreaking use of computer graphics. The first film to realize the full potential of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Jurassic Park isn't just a dazzling visual ride that will leave you astonished but will also surprise you with its interesting plot, blistering pace, well-developed characters, rousing music & its significant emphasis on man vs nature element. Adapted from the novel of the same name, Jurassic Park follows two dinosaur experts, Dr. Alan Grant & Dr. Ellie Sattler, who are invited by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond, to a preview tour of his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. Accompanied by a cynical scientist, Ian Malcolm & Hammond's two grandchildren, they discover the island to be full of living dinosaurs, created by a team of genetic scientists from cloning the dinosaurs' DNA collected from biologically preserved prehistoric insects. Everything goes smooth until a storm hits the island & an inside worker allows system security to fail so that he can steal the dinosaurs' embryos for his own monetary motives, allowing the dinosaurs to go loose all over the island thus turning the adventure ride into a race of survival. Director Steven Spielberg has proved over & over again why he is one of the best storytellers in film industry with a rare cinematic vision that appeals to critics & mainstream audience alike. And with Jurassic Park, Spielberg delivers once again to give us an experience that's as entertaining as any typical blockbuster but has enough characterization & substance to rise above the mainstream & etch itself in our minds forever. Michael Crichton, author of the novel, nicely adapts his book into a movie screenplay with finishing touch added by screenwriter David Koepp, and even though the final script leaves out detailed science of cloning and makes significant changes to the plot as well as characters while also toning down the violence, it still manages to do enough for viewers to invest their emotions in this film. Coming to the technical aspects, Jurassic Park has innovation written all over it. The set pieces are impressive to look at. The cinematography is brilliantly done. Editing very much takes care of this film's swift pace. But the one aspect where this film sets a whole new standard is in its pioneering visual & sound effects. The dinosaurs on-screen look insanely real, both the CGI & animatronics ones, and the amount of detail that went into the creation of each dinosaur is remarkable. Sound also breaks all barriers, not only as dinosaurs' roars but overall too and Spielberg put it to great effect in driving our emotions the way he wanted. And finally, the music by John Williams synchronizes so seamlessly with the film's sequences that it ended up elevating the film's experience to new levels. Boasting beautiful, adventurous & heartwarming tracks that in some sequences felt truly epic, the score of Jurassic Park just works and is easily one of Williams' finest. Everyone who watched this film remembers its jaw-dropping special effects but the performances of the cast often gets overlooked. And true that it's not as spectacular as the film's technical achievements, but it did play a vital role nonetheless without which this film would've fallen flat on the ground. It's the human element in this film that connects us with it and makes Jurassic Park what it is; a rip-roaring, thrilling adventure ride. Jurassic Park features an ensemble cast of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson & others and everyone chipped in just enough with their fine performances. Sam Neill stars as palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant and on a deeper analysis, the movie is about his character only and depicts the changes the whole experience of Jurassic Park brings to his personality, thus slashing out the lack of story's motive & character development criticism because the arc of Dr. Grant is very well-developed here but, sadly, is overshadowed by the film's true stars the dinosaurs. Even after 20 years, Jurassic Park hasn't aged a day plus the recent 3D re-release has not only added a new dimension to this film but also depth. In spite of not having a strong script or any notable performances, there is a reason why this film still works. Because the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus scene still dazzles us in ways very few movies are capable of, eventually leaving us with an immense sense of joy & excitement for what's next in store. Overall, Jurassic Park is a movie that was tailor-made for the talents of Steven Spielberg and presents the master director in tremendous form as he not only gave us one of the greatest blockbusters ever but also thrilled us with one unforgettable sequence after another and it, even today, remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. Wonderfully blending the adventure elements with a sense of wonder & amazement that only a Spielberg film can provide, Jurassic Park continues to be one of the most influential films of all time that not only made significant contribution to cinema but also turned an entire generation of spectators into dinosaur-obsessed freaks (I'm still one of them!). The most special film of my life, Jurassic Park is the movie that started my love affair with movies. And I can never thank Spielberg enough for crafting this, 65 million years in the making, adventure.

    Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie with amazing special effects, good leads, and (I don't say this often) a tremendous score. When a park may be open on an island, so John Hammond brings a couple of dinosaur experts, a doctor, and a lawyer to the island to see if they'll endorse the park. But when there, things go wrong one night as the dinosaurs now roam the island freely and it's a fight for survival. This film has had some of the most impressive special effects for a few reasons: 1.) For its time, it really made audiences gasp at its wonder. It's still good compared to today, but even better then. 2.) The effects on the dinosaurs make them seem very real. This is the first movie and one of the only movies where the dinosaurs looked real and made the movie feel real in a way which is hard to do. The film has characters like Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and the children (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards). The film though has characters that are not as good which hurt the film a little like Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is there to be funny but sometimes he is an ass instead of funny, like some people in real life, and made things feel awkward at times, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), an expendable character who is there only to die, not be anything too important as all he does is judge the park and die, and Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), the man who screws it up for money and is a fat, lazy, a-hole who is just a pain. He is supposed to be the bad guy and is, but is just too much a pain. This film has my favorite score ever as the film works perfectly into the movie, is peaceful and content and also heroic and bold. It is wonderful. This film is a terrific film that's beautiful to watch and is the same ever time I watch it. Me: A-

    Thanks to the 3D release I could watch this movie on a big screen again. A good movie should resist the passing of time, as in this case. It's visual effects still work, but the important thing is that the suspense still works. Spielberg's movies are always done by the book, and the fact that in this one he doesn't takes advantage of sentimentalism as shamelessly as usual improves the result. The only flaw (or the most significant) is the hilarious ending with the "heroic" T-Rex's appearance as a deus est machina and the falling flag. The best thing is the treatment of the "villain(s)", also by the book: we are told about the velociraptor since the beginning of the movie and it becomes a threatening presence that doesn't reveal itself until the second half of the movie. As in Jaws, things that we don't see are much more scary.

    Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.

    This movie is very original and I enjoyed it for the whole 127 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and the cast for this movie is great. The special effects for this movie were also great, especially the scene in the kitchen with Tim and Lex trying to get away from the Velociraptors. It has the same concept as the movie Tremors, except Jurassic Park is not a comedy. It is about a group of people that are invited to an island called Isla Nublar, which is filled with dinosaurs that were brought back to life. It all goes wrong when the dinosaurs escape and start to go after everybody. In the end, almost everybody gets back safely, but the island is still crawling with dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action packed sci-fi thriller:)

    I understand that the special effects and the originality of the underlying script justify some respect to this work. However the outcome of Mr Spielberg's efforts is nothing but annoying. Cheap thrills reiterating the horror of the "alien" beast and the holiness of the All- American family idol make this a pain to watch. How is a velociraptor transport and transfer device movable by a velociraptor? Why cant a T-Rex smell? Why is the rescue of a Multi-million dollar park left to 6 people suddenly all alone? Why is there no communication with Samuel L Jackson before he opens a bunker system to velociraptors which are hunting in a pack of three (two) outside and inside the bunker? The tears of sentiment brought to my eyes in the first scenes stating the extraordinary scientific achievement suggested are wasted to a dreamed up loss of control seemingly designed to reinstate our faith into the child-skeptic scientist who is "delivered" to be a family man. We are left with the notion "not to mess with god" who conveniently sends a T-Rex to solve our problems as we have confessed(?!). This is a disgrace for the thinking human being to be even considered a perceived reality- it is propaganda at best, destroying all the spirit other commentators might be tempted to mention in its favor. It "makes you think" just the wrong way. Be my guest to doubt the impact of genetic engineering (Monsanto) on existing ecosystems, but do it in a believable sound way, leaving out the Christian fear-mongering bullshit. One might say it is a fairytale alright but why does it try to be realistic when it is not? The notion that this should be voted over Schindler's List makes me cry.

    From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called " Jurassic Park. " Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****

    OK, is the plot that good? No. At least the set up isn't, it's cheesy monster movie stuff. Absolutely every bad decision that could be made generally is. Let's automate an entire park full of giant man eating dinosaurs in 1993. Then let's low ball the entire operation out to one guy. Then let's let the automation with thousands of bugs run the whole park before its ready. Then let's evacuate everyone because of a hurricane ensuring now one is there in case anything goes wrong, except about 10 people including the people inspecting the damned safety of the park for no reason. Then let's have the low balled guy screw everything up in the worst corporate robbery attempt ever by turning off every security system, stealing valuable goods, and just making a run for it onto the boat despite not being told to evacuate and him being the ONLY PERSON on the entire island that could've stolen the goods. And to top it off lets bash science in general as a main theme just because, despite science bringing the dinosaurs which is the entire thing that makes the plot cool to begin with. I know it's a movie, but at some point you begin to question the entire thing. But none of that makes more than a one star dent. Because you know what? The cast is just about absolutely perfect. Jeff Goldblum is so awesome in this movie it's ridiculous, same with Richard Attenborough. The rest of the cast is damned good, John Williams score soars as high as it ever has, and Spielberg is as on point in every shot and step of the way as he was with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The dialog has a weirdly memorable snap and flow to it that makes it as easily followable and memorable as movie like Star Wars: A New Hope and Pulp Fiction. And best of all, dinosaurs are awesome! No matter much progress was derided, no matter many people got eaten, you finish the movie thinking the same thing every time "Damn, seeing a real life dinosaur would be like the coolest most awesome thing EVER!" And that's why it's a must watch. It's just plain entertaining. It's fantastic, it's awesome. When you hear the word's "Welcome, to Jurassic Park" you'll feel like you're watching a real life dinosaur not ten feet in front of you, and that is one the most magical things you'll ever experience.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose... The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly.

    Few movies have had as great an impact on me as Jurassic Park the first time I saw this back in the 1990s as a little kid. This movie was not just a summer blockbuster, it was a pop culture PHENOMENON! I remember fondly those good ol' days, and the EXPLOSION of dinosaur toys, books, movies, TV shows, everything following in the wake of Jurassic Park. I recently had the pleasure of catching Jurassic Park once again on the big screen during the 20th Anniversary Rerelease. Let me begin by saying that Jurassic Park looks as beautiful and stunning on the big screen now as it did 20 years ago - even after so many years, even after Avatar and Inception and The Dark Knight, there is simply no experience that stacks up to seeing Jurassic Park on IMAX 3D! I can speak at great lengths as to the fantastic visual effects and sound work behind the film, the excellent directing by Steven Spielberg, the amazing soundtrack provided by John Williams (which may or may not rival those of Indiana Jones and Star Wars!), or the inspired acting performances by Sam Neil, Richard Attenborough, and, of course, the iconic "Must Go Faster!" Jeff Goldblum. But no, instead, I will focus on what I consider to be the REAL strength of this film, and the main reason why people see it in the first place: why, DINOSAURS, of course! Now, for a film starring DINOSAURS, actual dinosaurs only appear on screen for a total of 15 minutes. The brilliance of Jurassic Park is that, like Spielberg's JAWS, the entire movie is about the BUILD-UP to the dinosaurs, and about how we humans interact with them. Dinosaurs inhabited this planet for 150 million years, over 300 times longer than our species, Homo sapiens, has been around for. They were some of the largest and most magnificent creatures to ever grace Earth's natural history, and even after 65 million years of extinction, they continue to win the fascination and admiration of the human race the world over. Unlike many other movies that portray dinosaurs as mindless man-eating monsters, Jurassic Park actually takes great care to point out that dinosaurs are just animals like any other animal alive today - even the scary carnivores like the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a certain quality about it that you can't help but feel awed and fascinated by it even while you're running for your life! In a way, MAN is the true monster of the film, as it is man who believes himself above nature, and when man interferes with the natural order of the world, chaos and destruction ensues. For a Hollywood summer blockbuster, Jurassic Park is far more cleverly written than it has any right to be, but a lot of that is owed to writer Michael Crichton, that master of original and inventive science fiction stories. Rest in peace, Michael Crichton. Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ...

    Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.

    This movie is very original and I enjoyed it for the whole 127 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and the cast for this movie is great. The special effects for this movie were also great, especially the scene in the kitchen with Tim and Lex trying to get away from the Velociraptors. It has the same concept as the movie Tremors, except Jurassic Park is not a comedy. It is about a group of people that are invited to an island called Isla Nublar, which is filled with dinosaurs that were brought back to life. It all goes wrong when the dinosaurs escape and start to go after everybody. In the end, almost everybody gets back safely, but the island is still crawling with dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action packed sci-fi thriller:)
