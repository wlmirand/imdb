 <sinopse>
  Allied POWs plan for several hundred of their number to escape from a German camp during World War II.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Based on a true story, a group of allied escape artist-type prisoners-of-war (POW's) are all put in an 'escape proof' camp. Their leader decides to try to take out several hundred all at once. The first half of the film is played for comedy as the prisoners mostly outwit their jailers to dig the escape tunnel. The second half is high adventure as they use boats and trains and planes to get out of occupied Europe.

    Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway. Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film  but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes  this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s. It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.

    John Sturges("The Magnificent Seven") directs this superb, highly entertaining and action packed World War II film about Air Force officers sequestered in a POW camp by their Nazi captors. These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them "all in one basket", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape. A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters. This is even based on a true story!

    Based on a true story from WW2 "The Great Escape" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).

    This is a movie that glues me right to the screen. I love all of the tension in it and the plot is wicked exciting to follow. The whole time I feel attached to all the characters and feel all of the tension and everything with them. I don't know how historically accurate it is but it sure is interesting. Steve McQueen is terrific in in the film and it made me wonder how many people escaped out alive. He is always an unbelievable actor to watch and I can't even believe the guy. The characters and performances are exactly what I couldn't even believe about the film. As an Adventure, Drama, History, Thriller, and War this film is perfect. A movie that captures all kinds of things on the screen which is one of the reasons why I love watching it so much. One of the most exciting and unbelievable pictures ever brought to screen. I just love this movie as an experience in film and it is one of my favorites. This is a must watch if you want to see one of the all - time greats. This is unbelievable history and cinema which is what makes it such a great film.

    One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, "The Great Escape" stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.

    First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true "stinker?" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.

    Some films never get old. A group of Allied POWs decide they will stage a mass escape from their camp. The objective is not so much personal freedom. More than that, they plan to continue their mission as soldiers by disrupting the German war effort, even if it turns out to be a suicide mission. Cue one of the best ensemble casts ever, with heavyweights of USA and UK cinema including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn James Coburn, David McCallum and Gordon Jackson all featured. Impressively, they don't all just appear but actually turn up, each character distinctive and expertly fleshed out by the actors plying their trade. Some of the escapees inevitably meet a grislier fate than others: people remember the comedy and the pathos, but there are quite cathartic moments here, too. The film also makes brave choices - Steve McQueen and Angus Lennie as a double act? I see a game of casting the remake is current. I hope it stays a game. Some films are timeless and defy comparison.

    As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's "The Colditz Story" (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape" tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include "The Colditz Story", "The Wooden Horse" (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and "Danger Within" in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "King Rat", are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as "Roger Bartlett", is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike "The Colditz Story" or "The Wooden Horse" the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen" or Gregory Peck in "The Purple Plain", was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as "The Cooler King" because of the amount of time he spends in the "cooler", or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, "The King of Cool"). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight. The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like "The Colditz Story", as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned "Great Escape". The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe. We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10

    The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, "Big X" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.

    The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II.It features Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough together with James Donald,Charles Bronson,Donald Pleasence and James Coburn. The film is based on the book of the same title by Paul Brickhill, a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan in the province of Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany. The characters are composites of real men. It was produced and directed by John Sturges. The Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape. A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding "Cooler King." The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.

This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.

    Some films never get old. A group of Allied POWs decide they will stage a mass escape from their camp. The objective is not so much personal freedom. More than that, they plan to continue their mission as soldiers by disrupting the German war effort, even if it turns out to be a suicide mission. Cue one of the best ensemble casts ever, with heavyweights of USA and UK cinema including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn James Coburn, David McCallum and Gordon Jackson all featured. Impressively, they don't all just appear but actually turn up, each character distinctive and expertly fleshed out by the actors plying their trade. Some of the escapees inevitably meet a grislier fate than others: people remember the comedy and the pathos, but there are quite cathartic moments here, too. The film also makes brave choices - Steve McQueen and Angus Lennie as a double act? I see a game of casting the remake is current. I hope it stays a game. Some films are timeless and defy comparison.

    As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's "The Colditz Story" (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape" tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include "The Colditz Story", "The Wooden Horse" (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and "Danger Within" in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "King Rat", are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as "Roger Bartlett", is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike "The Colditz Story" or "The Wooden Horse" the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen" or Gregory Peck in "The Purple Plain", was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as "The Cooler King" because of the amount of time he spends in the "cooler", or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, "The King of Cool"). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight. The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like "The Colditz Story", as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned "Great Escape". The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe. We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10

    The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, "Big X" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.

    The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II.It features Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough together with James Donald,Charles Bronson,Donald Pleasence and James Coburn. The film is based on the book of the same title by Paul Brickhill, a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan in the province of Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany. The characters are composites of real men. It was produced and directed by John Sturges. The Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape. A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding "Cooler King." The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.

    Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway. Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film  but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes  this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s. It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.

    John Sturges("The Magnificent Seven") directs this superb, highly entertaining and action packed World War II film about Air Force officers sequestered in a POW camp by their Nazi captors. These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them "all in one basket", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape. A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters. This is even based on a true story!

    Based on a true story from WW2 "The Great Escape" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).

    This is a movie that glues me right to the screen. I love all of the tension in it and the plot is wicked exciting to follow. The whole time I feel attached to all the characters and feel all of the tension and everything with them. I don't know how historically accurate it is but it sure is interesting. Steve McQueen is terrific in in the film and it made me wonder how many people escaped out alive. He is always an unbelievable actor to watch and I can't even believe the guy. The characters and performances are exactly what I couldn't even believe about the film. As an Adventure, Drama, History, Thriller, and War this film is perfect. A movie that captures all kinds of things on the screen which is one of the reasons why I love watching it so much. One of the most exciting and unbelievable pictures ever brought to screen. I just love this movie as an experience in film and it is one of my favorites. This is a must watch if you want to see one of the all - time greats. This is unbelievable history and cinema which is what makes it such a great film.

    One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, "The Great Escape" stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.

Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.

    The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II.It features Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough together with James Donald,Charles Bronson,Donald Pleasence and James Coburn. The film is based on the book of the same title by Paul Brickhill, a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan in the province of Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany. The characters are composites of real men. It was produced and directed by John Sturges. The Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape. A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding "Cooler King." The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.

    Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway. Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film  but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes  this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s. It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.

    John Sturges("The Magnificent Seven") directs this superb, highly entertaining and action packed World War II film about Air Force officers sequestered in a POW camp by their Nazi captors. These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them "all in one basket", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape. A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters. This is even based on a true story!

    Based on a true story from WW2 "The Great Escape" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).

    This is a movie that glues me right to the screen. I love all of the tension in it and the plot is wicked exciting to follow. The whole time I feel attached to all the characters and feel all of the tension and everything with them. I don't know how historically accurate it is but it sure is interesting. Steve McQueen is terrific in in the film and it made me wonder how many people escaped out alive. He is always an unbelievable actor to watch and I can't even believe the guy. The characters and performances are exactly what I couldn't even believe about the film. As an Adventure, Drama, History, Thriller, and War this film is perfect. A movie that captures all kinds of things on the screen which is one of the reasons why I love watching it so much. One of the most exciting and unbelievable pictures ever brought to screen. I just love this movie as an experience in film and it is one of my favorites. This is a must watch if you want to see one of the all - time greats. This is unbelievable history and cinema which is what makes it such a great film.

    One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, "The Great Escape" stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.

    First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true "stinker?" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.

    Some films never get old. A group of Allied POWs decide they will stage a mass escape from their camp. The objective is not so much personal freedom. More than that, they plan to continue their mission as soldiers by disrupting the German war effort, even if it turns out to be a suicide mission. Cue one of the best ensemble casts ever, with heavyweights of USA and UK cinema including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn James Coburn, David McCallum and Gordon Jackson all featured. Impressively, they don't all just appear but actually turn up, each character distinctive and expertly fleshed out by the actors plying their trade. Some of the escapees inevitably meet a grislier fate than others: people remember the comedy and the pathos, but there are quite cathartic moments here, too. The film also makes brave choices - Steve McQueen and Angus Lennie as a double act? I see a game of casting the remake is current. I hope it stays a game. Some films are timeless and defy comparison.

    As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's "The Colditz Story" (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape" tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include "The Colditz Story", "The Wooden Horse" (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and "Danger Within" in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "King Rat", are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as "Roger Bartlett", is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike "The Colditz Story" or "The Wooden Horse" the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen" or Gregory Peck in "The Purple Plain", was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as "The Cooler King" because of the amount of time he spends in the "cooler", or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, "The King of Cool"). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight. The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like "The Colditz Story", as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned "Great Escape". The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe. We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10

    The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, "Big X" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots.

It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.

This is unbelievable history and cinema which is what makes it such a great film.

    One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, "The Great Escape" stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.

    First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true "stinker?" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.

    Some films never get old. A group of Allied POWs decide they will stage a mass escape from their camp. The objective is not so much personal freedom. More than that, they plan to continue their mission as soldiers by disrupting the German war effort, even if it turns out to be a suicide mission. Cue one of the best ensemble casts ever, with heavyweights of USA and UK cinema including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn James Coburn, David McCallum and Gordon Jackson all featured. Impressively, they don't all just appear but actually turn up, each character distinctive and expertly fleshed out by the actors plying their trade. Some of the escapees inevitably meet a grislier fate than others: people remember the comedy and the pathos, but there are quite cathartic moments here, too. The film also makes brave choices - Steve McQueen and Angus Lennie as a double act? I see a game of casting the remake is current. I hope it stays a game. Some films are timeless and defy comparison.

    As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's "The Colditz Story" (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape" tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include "The Colditz Story", "The Wooden Horse" (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and "Danger Within" in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "King Rat", are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as "Roger Bartlett", is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike "The Colditz Story" or "The Wooden Horse" the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen" or Gregory Peck in "The Purple Plain", was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as "The Cooler King" because of the amount of time he spends in the "cooler", or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, "The King of Cool"). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight. The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like "The Colditz Story", as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned "Great Escape". The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe. We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10

    The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, "Big X" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.

    The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II.It features Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough together with James Donald,Charles Bronson,Donald Pleasence and James Coburn. The film is based on the book of the same title by Paul Brickhill, a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan in the province of Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany. The characters are composites of real men. It was produced and directed by John Sturges. The Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape. A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding "Cooler King." The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.

    Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway. Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film  but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes  this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s. It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.

    John Sturges("The Magnificent Seven") directs this superb, highly entertaining and action packed World War II film about Air Force officers sequestered in a POW camp by their Nazi captors. These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them "all in one basket", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape. A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters. This is even based on a true story!

    Based on a true story from WW2 "The Great Escape" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).

    This is a movie that glues me right to the screen. I love all of the tension in it and the plot is wicked exciting to follow. The whole time I feel attached to all the characters and feel all of the tension and everything with them. I don't know how historically accurate it is but it sure is interesting. Steve McQueen is terrific in in the film and it made me wonder how many people escaped out alive. He is always an unbelievable actor to watch and I can't even believe the guy. The characters and performances are exactly what I couldn't even believe about the film. As an Adventure, Drama, History, Thriller, and War this film is perfect. A movie that captures all kinds of things on the screen which is one of the reasons why I love watching it so much. One of the most exciting and unbelievable pictures ever brought to screen. I just love this movie as an experience in film and it is one of my favorites. This is a must watch if you want to see one of the all - time greats.

Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.

    The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II.It features Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough together with James Donald,Charles Bronson,Donald Pleasence and James Coburn. The film is based on the book of the same title by Paul Brickhill, a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan in the province of Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany. The characters are composites of real men. It was produced and directed by John Sturges. The Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape. A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding "Cooler King." The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.

    Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway. Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film  but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes  this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s. It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.

    John Sturges("The Magnificent Seven") directs this superb, highly entertaining and action packed World War II film about Air Force officers sequestered in a POW camp by their Nazi captors. These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them "all in one basket", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape. A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters. This is even based on a true story!

    Based on a true story from WW2 "The Great Escape" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).

    This is a movie that glues me right to the screen. I love all of the tension in it and the plot is wicked exciting to follow. The whole time I feel attached to all the characters and feel all of the tension and everything with them. I don't know how historically accurate it is but it sure is interesting. Steve McQueen is terrific in in the film and it made me wonder how many people escaped out alive. He is always an unbelievable actor to watch and I can't even believe the guy. The characters and performances are exactly what I couldn't even believe about the film. As an Adventure, Drama, History, Thriller, and War this film is perfect. A movie that captures all kinds of things on the screen which is one of the reasons why I love watching it so much. One of the most exciting and unbelievable pictures ever brought to screen. I just love this movie as an experience in film and it is one of my favorites. This is a must watch if you want to see one of the all - time greats. This is unbelievable history and cinema which is what makes it such a great film.

    One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, "The Great Escape" stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.

    First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true "stinker?" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.

    Some films never get old. A group of Allied POWs decide they will stage a mass escape from their camp. The objective is not so much personal freedom. More than that, they plan to continue their mission as soldiers by disrupting the German war effort, even if it turns out to be a suicide mission. Cue one of the best ensemble casts ever, with heavyweights of USA and UK cinema including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn James Coburn, David McCallum and Gordon Jackson all featured. Impressively, they don't all just appear but actually turn up, each character distinctive and expertly fleshed out by the actors plying their trade. Some of the escapees inevitably meet a grislier fate than others: people remember the comedy and the pathos, but there are quite cathartic moments here, too. The film also makes brave choices - Steve McQueen and Angus Lennie as a double act? I see a game of casting the remake is current. I hope it stays a game. Some films are timeless and defy comparison.

    As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's "The Colditz Story" (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape" tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include "The Colditz Story", "The Wooden Horse" (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and "Danger Within" in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "King Rat", are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as "Roger Bartlett", is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike "The Colditz Story" or "The Wooden Horse" the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen" or Gregory Peck in "The Purple Plain", was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as "The Cooler King" because of the amount of time he spends in the "cooler", or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, "The King of Cool"). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight. The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like "The Colditz Story", as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned "Great Escape". The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe. We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10

    The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, "Big X" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. .

He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie.

Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).

    This is a movie that glues me right to the screen. I love all of the tension in it and the plot is wicked exciting to follow. The whole time I feel attached to all the characters and feel all of the tension and everything with them. I don't know how historically accurate it is but it sure is interesting. Steve McQueen is terrific in in the film and it made me wonder how many people escaped out alive. He is always an unbelievable actor to watch and I can't even believe the guy. The characters and performances are exactly what I couldn't even believe about the film. As an Adventure, Drama, History, Thriller, and War this film is perfect. A movie that captures all kinds of things on the screen which is one of the reasons why I love watching it so much. One of the most exciting and unbelievable pictures ever brought to screen. I just love this movie as an experience in film and it is one of my favorites. This is a must watch if you want to see one of the all - time greats. This is unbelievable history and cinema which is what makes it such a great film.

    One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, "The Great Escape" stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.

    First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true "stinker?" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.

    Some films never get old. A group of Allied POWs decide they will stage a mass escape from their camp. The objective is not so much personal freedom. More than that, they plan to continue their mission as soldiers by disrupting the German war effort, even if it turns out to be a suicide mission. Cue one of the best ensemble casts ever, with heavyweights of USA and UK cinema including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn James Coburn, David McCallum and Gordon Jackson all featured. Impressively, they don't all just appear but actually turn up, each character distinctive and expertly fleshed out by the actors plying their trade. Some of the escapees inevitably meet a grislier fate than others: people remember the comedy and the pathos, but there are quite cathartic moments here, too. The film also makes brave choices - Steve McQueen and Angus Lennie as a double act? I see a game of casting the remake is current. I hope it stays a game. Some films are timeless and defy comparison.

    As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's "The Colditz Story" (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape" tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include "The Colditz Story", "The Wooden Horse" (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and "Danger Within" in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "King Rat", are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as "Roger Bartlett", is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike "The Colditz Story" or "The Wooden Horse" the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen" or Gregory Peck in "The Purple Plain", was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as "The Cooler King" because of the amount of time he spends in the "cooler", or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, "The King of Cool"). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight. The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like "The Colditz Story", as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned "Great Escape". The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe. We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10

    The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, "Big X" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.

    The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II.It features Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough together with James Donald,Charles Bronson,Donald Pleasence and James Coburn. The film is based on the book of the same title by Paul Brickhill, a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan in the province of Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany. The characters are composites of real men. It was produced and directed by John Sturges. The Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape. A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding "Cooler King." The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.

    Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway. Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film  but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes  this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s. It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.

    John Sturges("The Magnificent Seven") directs this superb, highly entertaining and action packed World War II film about Air Force officers sequestered in a POW camp by their Nazi captors. These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them "all in one basket", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape. A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters. This is even based on a true story!

    Based on a true story from WW2 "The Great Escape" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).

The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe. We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10

    The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, "Big X" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.

    The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II.It features Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough together with James Donald,Charles Bronson,Donald Pleasence and James Coburn. The film is based on the book of the same title by Paul Brickhill, a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan in the province of Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany. The characters are composites of real men. It was produced and directed by John Sturges. The Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape. A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding "Cooler King." The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.

    Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway. Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film  but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes  this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s. It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.

    John Sturges("The Magnificent Seven") directs this superb, highly entertaining and action packed World War II film about Air Force officers sequestered in a POW camp by their Nazi captors. These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them "all in one basket", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape. A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters. This is even based on a true story!

    Based on a true story from WW2 "The Great Escape" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).

    This is a movie that glues me right to the screen. I love all of the tension in it and the plot is wicked exciting to follow. The whole time I feel attached to all the characters and feel all of the tension and everything with them. I don't know how historically accurate it is but it sure is interesting. Steve McQueen is terrific in in the film and it made me wonder how many people escaped out alive. He is always an unbelievable actor to watch and I can't even believe the guy. The characters and performances are exactly what I couldn't even believe about the film. As an Adventure, Drama, History, Thriller, and War this film is perfect. A movie that captures all kinds of things on the screen which is one of the reasons why I love watching it so much. One of the most exciting and unbelievable pictures ever brought to screen. I just love this movie as an experience in film and it is one of my favorites. This is a must watch if you want to see one of the all - time greats. This is unbelievable history and cinema which is what makes it such a great film.

    One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, "The Great Escape" stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.

    First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true "stinker?" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.

    Some films never get old. A group of Allied POWs decide they will stage a mass escape from their camp. The objective is not so much personal freedom. More than that, they plan to continue their mission as soldiers by disrupting the German war effort, even if it turns out to be a suicide mission. Cue one of the best ensemble casts ever, with heavyweights of USA and UK cinema including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn James Coburn, David McCallum and Gordon Jackson all featured. Impressively, they don't all just appear but actually turn up, each character distinctive and expertly fleshed out by the actors plying their trade. Some of the escapees inevitably meet a grislier fate than others: people remember the comedy and the pathos, but there are quite cathartic moments here, too. The film also makes brave choices - Steve McQueen and Angus Lennie as a double act? I see a game of casting the remake is current. I hope it stays a game. Some films are timeless and defy comparison.

    As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's "The Colditz Story" (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape" tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include "The Colditz Story", "The Wooden Horse" (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and "Danger Within" in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "King Rat", are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as "Roger Bartlett", is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike "The Colditz Story" or "The Wooden Horse" the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen" or Gregory Peck in "The Purple Plain", was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as "The Cooler King" because of the amount of time he spends in the "cooler", or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, "The King of Cool"). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight. The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like "The Colditz Story", as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned "Great Escape". The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe. We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10
