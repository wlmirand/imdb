 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  One of the obsessive speculations in American history is whether Thomas Jefferson, in the years before he became president, had an affair with (and fathered a child with) his 15-year-old slave Sally Hemings. JEFFERSON IN PARIS follows Jefferson to France (as the U.S. ambassador to the court of Louis XVI), following the death of his wife his friendships and flirtations with the French, his relationship with his daughters and slaves from home (especially Sally), against the backdrop of the beginning of the French Revolution.

    Jefferson promised to his wife on her deathbed that he would never marry again. It turns out that Sally Hemings and Jefferson's wife were half-sisters ... they had the same father. It has been noted that Jefferson's older daughter knew of the relationship but of course it wasn't discussed in their presumably polite household. I just got a tape (that's the only format available today) and I haven't looked at it yet. Since I saw the film only when it was released, and I've learned a lot about Jefferson since then, I'm looking forward to finding free time to just sit and watch. I'll be back and possibly change my rating, but I remember wishing for a more dynamic actor to play Jefferson.

    I've enjoyed several earlier Merchant-Ivory films very much: Remains of the Day, Howard's End, Maurice. But this one, though it has all the same basic ingredients - director, script writer - left me flat. It moved far too slowly, and never caught me up in Jefferson the man - though I have always found Jefferson very interesting. We never see any conflict in Jefferson between his supposed vows to stay faithful to his first, deceased wife and then his feelings for either Maria Cosway or Sally Hemmings. Indeed, we really get very little sense of his feelings for Hemmings at all, and certainly they would have been complex. Nor do we ever learn why Jefferson's older daughter wants to convert to Catholicism - that, too, given her upbringing, would have caused conflicting emotions. There is also very little connect between Jefferson and the Revolution getting underway. The costumes and sets are all very beautiful, of course, and no doubt very well-researched. But I got no sense of Jefferson from this movie. (I leave to one side the issue of whether Jefferson did actually father Hemmings' children; this isn't a documentary, so that's not relevant.)

    It's been ages since I've seen this film, so pardon me if my review is somewhat foreshortened. What I do recall from this film is that it is visually sumptuous. Pierre Lhomme gives us some breathtaking shots of period architecture, sets and costumes for a time when a fledgling United States is trying to keep good on its promise to France. As Variety's review alluded to in their comments, Jefferson is an elusive persona. A private man where like many who have a great deal of varied interests, particularly in matters scientific (including social studies), Jefferson kept to himself. How do you tap into the inner thoughts and emotions of a man who is wrapped up in the progress of science and civilization? Where does one start for such an individual in terms of a visual portrayal. Were I to shoot such a picture, I would start with his writings. I'm sure that's what screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala did, but the male perspective on the advancement of mankind is not weighted with emotional turbulence that the female of the species often concerns themselves with. So it is that a woman trying to write for a man is only offset by the visual portrayal courtesy the film's visual trappings. The lady trying to write for the man gives us an emotionally charged, yet strangely reserved, Jefferson. As if he's a conglomerate of two personas; one trying to fit and/or exist with another. The obvious point of interest regarding the film is the Sally Hemming's factor. Did Jefferson sire children with her? There's a lot of circumstantial evidence that would suggest that Jefferson interacted with Hemmings in more than just a common master-slave relationship, but does this connote a sexual relationship? I'm not sure it does. But then again I don't really know like the rest of the world. My personal opinion is that Jefferson might have favored her as a bridge between African slaves and their Anglo owners as perhaps a woman to be studied. To this end, again my personal opinion, it may be that whatever relationship existed, was probably not sexual, but most certainly personal. Perhaps more father-daughter than man-woman. I say that because Jefferson, to me, doesn't seem the type to experiment haphazardly. I don't think there's anything wrong with men and women of different backgrounds coupling. Quite the contrary, I think it's a good thing. But Jefferson seems to be a man of reserve. Not one prone to bursts of passion. And perhaps this is why the film is as held back as it is. We simply are in the dark when it comes to Jefferson's alleged romantic forays--if any. Nick Nolte was an interesting pick to play the role. I usually envision him in rough and ready roles. I don't often think of his thespian type when playing thoughtful contemplatives. But he is a professional actor, and being highly intelligent and capable, gives us an aged Jefferson who is somewhat haggard, but still wondrous and optimistic in regards to the world and social change. There is an almost boyish fascination coming through Nolte's performance as we see him on screen. "Jefferson in Paris" as a visual piece, is a real feast for the eyes. We are taken back to late 18th century Paris. The age of wooden ships and iron men plying the Atlantic and Mediterranean is in full swing. Muskets and fiery political rhetoric are reshaping western thinking, as the former British Colonies reach out to the world to feel their way. Their emissary; Thomas Jefferson. The man who wrote not only our famous document the "Declaration of Independence", but also the incendiary paper media that fired the colonies into full rebellion in the first place. Words like "we are resolved to die free men, rather than to live as slaves" had real power back then in not only a provincial eastern seaboard society, that was the united colonies, but also a resounding effect in Europe, as the lower classes heard rumors about an upstart group of king's subjects rising against the most powerful naval force and army on the face of the Earth. France and Spain helped with the effort, and so it was that after Cornwallis surrendered the British flag, that Jefferson was sent to France to continue American-Franco relations. This film tells a slice of that intriguing period, and does so with perhaps some mixed results, but visually satisfying all the same. In truth, we just don't know the hearts of the two parties involved as the focus of this piece. We truly don't, and so Merchant-Ivory films does it's best to embellish what is theorized about Jefferson and Hemmings. Again, my opinion is that things were probably a bit more prosaic between the two. It's an interesting watch, but probably not for everyone. Period film buffs will want to give it whirl, but the casual film viewer probably won't find too much interest. Either way it's worth seeing at least once.

    The DNA test is inconclusive, there is just as much likelihood that Randolph Jefferson was the father. To make this the opening scene and a big part of the story is a travesty and worthy of tabloid press not a historical drama. "Historians have the wrong Jefferson. Hyland, an experienced trial lawyer, presents the most reliable historical evidence while dissecting the unreliable, and in doing so he cuts through centuries of unsubstantiated charges. The author reminds us that the DNA tests identified Eston Hemings, Sally's youngest child, as being merely the descendant of a "Jefferson male." Randolph Jefferson, the president's wayward, younger brother with a reputation for socializing among the Monticello slaves, emerges as the most likely of several possible candidates."

    We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-I's reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago, it was very much a Liberal Agenda objective to trash the Founding Fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ School Board and their subversive deed. A small part of this was headlining the alleged Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson connection, disregarding the inconvenient DNA findings which failed to support the wacky left's agenda. Never mind! They got James Ellis, an author of dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and Columbia University sealed the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. As to Jefferson in Paris, the Liberal Agenda spin begins in the opening scene wherein James Earl Jones is claiming to be the son of Jefferson. The spin simply continues in flashback mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the Hemmings allegation would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of Jefferson's prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to Paris (as well as to the Netherlands where he secured crucial financial backing for America when our infant nation was without funds). Besides the Liberal Spin Job, there is nothing else of interest in this drab and tortuously dull movie. Some of the other history is indeed accurate --- adding credence to frame the lie --- but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia. Please do not ask me why Liberals set out to trash the Founding Fathers, because I don't waste time explaining the acts of such people. Don't ask them either; they usually respond to such questions with the same answer: "SHUT UP!"

    I have written a book on this subject, "The Slave Children of Thomas Jefferson", first published in 1992, so I was expecting to find numerous errors. However, I could not find any. They seem to have made a special effort to make it as accurate as possible, so that a viewer will actually learn a bit of history. This movie is really more about the history of France, than about the history of America. The French Revolution begins to unfold before your eyes, although the real revolution did not take place until after Jefferson had returned to America. One problem is that the movie is not very exciting. No car chase scenes, for example. However, this is understandable since it would be difficult to make a film which is both historically accurate and a success at the box office. Also, the movie does not actually show Thomas Jefferson in bed with either Maria Cosway or Sally Hemings. It is widely believed among historians that Jefferson slept with both women during his stay in Paris, but there is no real proof that either relationship occurred, and therefore the filmmakers wisely left that out.

    The lavish production values that you generally find in a Merchant/Ivory film are all here, but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair. I agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an African American family and yet their own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, has barely a role to play in the proceedings. There is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures. And I was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters. Nancy Marchand sounded very British for what one assumes is a French nun. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is. One moment she is slapping a slave, and another moment, she's deploring the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for Jefferson or any of his exploits. Very disappointing all in all.

    This film did not make too much of a splash when it was in the theatres here after its initial release but I was fortunate to watch it last evening on a purchased video. I am glad that I saw this film and that, at least for me, it did not just pass into the oblivion of movies that do not make waves when released. I found the film absorbing; the characters were well formed-Nolte particularly was out of the stereotyped roles he is usually landed with and Scacchi played her role to her usual excellence. The stars, however, where Sally and her brother who stole the show from these aforementioned veterans. They nuanced their roles perfectly and brought substance to the many layers of history and social maneuvering that was so much a part of this turbulent period. This was not a lazy persons afternoon time filler. This film demands attention from the viewer because those many layers must be watched carefully or else the whole film loses its continuity. The story is composed of many distinct pieces forming, not only Jefferson's domestic concerns but also the historical whirlwind of this convulsive period in French history. I thought James Ivory did a marvelous job of stitching together the many facets of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's insightful script. This was a momentous period and I do not believe the script was too complex-anything less would not have done justice to this complexity, interest and beauty of this turbulent period in history. I believe the movie works on many levels and I am hugely happy that even late I was able to see this great film.

    A well researched period piece from the Merchant-Ivory team, the depicted setting and era come alive with the apt costumes and sets. The film however tells little in the way of a story, and the methods of narration are awfully clumsy. The whole Jefferson story is supposedly narrated by one person, however that story in itself is narrated by the Jefferson character and others through different letters. It is a bit confusing, and does not gel well together. Even if it is hard to explain, it should be easy to pick up on this awkwardness when watching the film. Some of the sequences also feel like they are just for show, for they add very little to the story. However, even if this is a flawed film, it has enough good qualities to rate above average. The film is set to wonderful Richard Robbins music and Thandie Newton really makes the most of her role. There is quite a bit that one can enjoy in this film, even if it is hardly perfect viewing.

    So many of the negative comments seem to be reactions against either downplaying or overemphasizing Jefferson's relationship with Sally. It strikes me that this is a reasonably balanced presentation of what's been learned in recent years. Other negative critiques are the disappointments recorded by patriots expecting some grandiose pageant for Fourth of July consumption. But this is all-in-all a less pretentious and better film than the typical celebration of Americana. Nolte presents Jefferson as an idealistic but very human being. Paltrow is very persuasive as Patsy, and many of the rest of the cast present excellent (or well-proportioned) characterizations. Except for some trivial inaccuracies, this is a richly textured reconstruction of history as it may very well have occurred. I find that I look in on it just about every time it pops up on cable--and I'm always rewarded.

Nancy Marchand sounded very British for what one assumes is a French nun. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is. One moment she is slapping a slave, and another moment, she's deploring the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for Jefferson or any of his exploits. Very disappointing all in all.

    This film did not make too much of a splash when it was in the theatres here after its initial release but I was fortunate to watch it last evening on a purchased video. I am glad that I saw this film and that, at least for me, it did not just pass into the oblivion of movies that do not make waves when released. I found the film absorbing; the characters were well formed-Nolte particularly was out of the stereotyped roles he is usually landed with and Scacchi played her role to her usual excellence. The stars, however, where Sally and her brother who stole the show from these aforementioned veterans. They nuanced their roles perfectly and brought substance to the many layers of history and social maneuvering that was so much a part of this turbulent period. This was not a lazy persons afternoon time filler. This film demands attention from the viewer because those many layers must be watched carefully or else the whole film loses its continuity. The story is composed of many distinct pieces forming, not only Jefferson's domestic concerns but also the historical whirlwind of this convulsive period in French history. I thought James Ivory did a marvelous job of stitching together the many facets of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's insightful script. This was a momentous period and I do not believe the script was too complex-anything less would not have done justice to this complexity, interest and beauty of this turbulent period in history. I believe the movie works on many levels and I am hugely happy that even late I was able to see this great film.

    A well researched period piece from the Merchant-Ivory team, the depicted setting and era come alive with the apt costumes and sets. The film however tells little in the way of a story, and the methods of narration are awfully clumsy. The whole Jefferson story is supposedly narrated by one person, however that story in itself is narrated by the Jefferson character and others through different letters. It is a bit confusing, and does not gel well together. Even if it is hard to explain, it should be easy to pick up on this awkwardness when watching the film. Some of the sequences also feel like they are just for show, for they add very little to the story. However, even if this is a flawed film, it has enough good qualities to rate above average. The film is set to wonderful Richard Robbins music and Thandie Newton really makes the most of her role. There is quite a bit that one can enjoy in this film, even if it is hardly perfect viewing.

    So many of the negative comments seem to be reactions against either downplaying or overemphasizing Jefferson's relationship with Sally. It strikes me that this is a reasonably balanced presentation of what's been learned in recent years. Other negative critiques are the disappointments recorded by patriots expecting some grandiose pageant for Fourth of July consumption. But this is all-in-all a less pretentious and better film than the typical celebration of Americana. Nolte presents Jefferson as an idealistic but very human being. Paltrow is very persuasive as Patsy, and many of the rest of the cast present excellent (or well-proportioned) characterizations. Except for some trivial inaccuracies, this is a richly textured reconstruction of history as it may very well have occurred. I find that I look in on it just about every time it pops up on cable--and I'm always rewarded.

    Jefferson promised to his wife on her deathbed that he would never marry again. It turns out that Sally Hemings and Jefferson's wife were half-sisters ... they had the same father. It has been noted that Jefferson's older daughter knew of the relationship but of course it wasn't discussed in their presumably polite household. I just got a tape (that's the only format available today) and I haven't looked at it yet. Since I saw the film only when it was released, and I've learned a lot about Jefferson since then, I'm looking forward to finding free time to just sit and watch. I'll be back and possibly change my rating, but I remember wishing for a more dynamic actor to play Jefferson.

    I've enjoyed several earlier Merchant-Ivory films very much: Remains of the Day, Howard's End, Maurice. But this one, though it has all the same basic ingredients - director, script writer - left me flat. It moved far too slowly, and never caught me up in Jefferson the man - though I have always found Jefferson very interesting. We never see any conflict in Jefferson between his supposed vows to stay faithful to his first, deceased wife and then his feelings for either Maria Cosway or Sally Hemmings. Indeed, we really get very little sense of his feelings for Hemmings at all, and certainly they would have been complex. Nor do we ever learn why Jefferson's older daughter wants to convert to Catholicism - that, too, given her upbringing, would have caused conflicting emotions. There is also very little connect between Jefferson and the Revolution getting underway. The costumes and sets are all very beautiful, of course, and no doubt very well-researched. But I got no sense of Jefferson from this movie. (I leave to one side the issue of whether Jefferson did actually father Hemmings' children; this isn't a documentary, so that's not relevant.)

    It's been ages since I've seen this film, so pardon me if my review is somewhat foreshortened. What I do recall from this film is that it is visually sumptuous. Pierre Lhomme gives us some breathtaking shots of period architecture, sets and costumes for a time when a fledgling United States is trying to keep good on its promise to France. As Variety's review alluded to in their comments, Jefferson is an elusive persona. A private man where like many who have a great deal of varied interests, particularly in matters scientific (including social studies), Jefferson kept to himself. How do you tap into the inner thoughts and emotions of a man who is wrapped up in the progress of science and civilization? Where does one start for such an individual in terms of a visual portrayal. Were I to shoot such a picture, I would start with his writings. I'm sure that's what screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala did, but the male perspective on the advancement of mankind is not weighted with emotional turbulence that the female of the species often concerns themselves with. So it is that a woman trying to write for a man is only offset by the visual portrayal courtesy the film's visual trappings. The lady trying to write for the man gives us an emotionally charged, yet strangely reserved, Jefferson. As if he's a conglomerate of two personas; one trying to fit and/or exist with another. The obvious point of interest regarding the film is the Sally Hemming's factor. Did Jefferson sire children with her? There's a lot of circumstantial evidence that would suggest that Jefferson interacted with Hemmings in more than just a common master-slave relationship, but does this connote a sexual relationship? I'm not sure it does. But then again I don't really know like the rest of the world. My personal opinion is that Jefferson might have favored her as a bridge between African slaves and their Anglo owners as perhaps a woman to be studied. To this end, again my personal opinion, it may be that whatever relationship existed, was probably not sexual, but most certainly personal. Perhaps more father-daughter than man-woman. I say that because Jefferson, to me, doesn't seem the type to experiment haphazardly. I don't think there's anything wrong with men and women of different backgrounds coupling. Quite the contrary, I think it's a good thing. But Jefferson seems to be a man of reserve. Not one prone to bursts of passion. And perhaps this is why the film is as held back as it is. We simply are in the dark when it comes to Jefferson's alleged romantic forays--if any. Nick Nolte was an interesting pick to play the role. I usually envision him in rough and ready roles. I don't often think of his thespian type when playing thoughtful contemplatives. But he is a professional actor, and being highly intelligent and capable, gives us an aged Jefferson who is somewhat haggard, but still wondrous and optimistic in regards to the world and social change. There is an almost boyish fascination coming through Nolte's performance as we see him on screen. "Jefferson in Paris" as a visual piece, is a real feast for the eyes. We are taken back to late 18th century Paris. The age of wooden ships and iron men plying the Atlantic and Mediterranean is in full swing. Muskets and fiery political rhetoric are reshaping western thinking, as the former British Colonies reach out to the world to feel their way. Their emissary; Thomas Jefferson. The man who wrote not only our famous document the "Declaration of Independence", but also the incendiary paper media that fired the colonies into full rebellion in the first place. Words like "we are resolved to die free men, rather than to live as slaves" had real power back then in not only a provincial eastern seaboard society, that was the united colonies, but also a resounding effect in Europe, as the lower classes heard rumors about an upstart group of king's subjects rising against the most powerful naval force and army on the face of the Earth. France and Spain helped with the effort, and so it was that after Cornwallis surrendered the British flag, that Jefferson was sent to France to continue American-Franco relations. This film tells a slice of that intriguing period, and does so with perhaps some mixed results, but visually satisfying all the same. In truth, we just don't know the hearts of the two parties involved as the focus of this piece. We truly don't, and so Merchant-Ivory films does it's best to embellish what is theorized about Jefferson and Hemmings. Again, my opinion is that things were probably a bit more prosaic between the two. It's an interesting watch, but probably not for everyone. Period film buffs will want to give it whirl, but the casual film viewer probably won't find too much interest. Either way it's worth seeing at least once.

    The DNA test is inconclusive, there is just as much likelihood that Randolph Jefferson was the father. To make this the opening scene and a big part of the story is a travesty and worthy of tabloid press not a historical drama. "Historians have the wrong Jefferson. Hyland, an experienced trial lawyer, presents the most reliable historical evidence while dissecting the unreliable, and in doing so he cuts through centuries of unsubstantiated charges. The author reminds us that the DNA tests identified Eston Hemings, Sally's youngest child, as being merely the descendant of a "Jefferson male." Randolph Jefferson, the president's wayward, younger brother with a reputation for socializing among the Monticello slaves, emerges as the most likely of several possible candidates."

    We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-I's reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago, it was very much a Liberal Agenda objective to trash the Founding Fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ School Board and their subversive deed. A small part of this was headlining the alleged Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson connection, disregarding the inconvenient DNA findings which failed to support the wacky left's agenda. Never mind! They got James Ellis, an author of dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and Columbia University sealed the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. As to Jefferson in Paris, the Liberal Agenda spin begins in the opening scene wherein James Earl Jones is claiming to be the son of Jefferson. The spin simply continues in flashback mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the Hemmings allegation would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of Jefferson's prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to Paris (as well as to the Netherlands where he secured crucial financial backing for America when our infant nation was without funds). Besides the Liberal Spin Job, there is nothing else of interest in this drab and tortuously dull movie. Some of the other history is indeed accurate --- adding credence to frame the lie --- but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia. Please do not ask me why Liberals set out to trash the Founding Fathers, because I don't waste time explaining the acts of such people. Don't ask them either; they usually respond to such questions with the same answer: "SHUT UP!"

    I have written a book on this subject, "The Slave Children of Thomas Jefferson", first published in 1992, so I was expecting to find numerous errors. However, I could not find any. They seem to have made a special effort to make it as accurate as possible, so that a viewer will actually learn a bit of history. This movie is really more about the history of France, than about the history of America. The French Revolution begins to unfold before your eyes, although the real revolution did not take place until after Jefferson had returned to America. One problem is that the movie is not very exciting. No car chase scenes, for example. However, this is understandable since it would be difficult to make a film which is both historically accurate and a success at the box office. Also, the movie does not actually show Thomas Jefferson in bed with either Maria Cosway or Sally Hemings. It is widely believed among historians that Jefferson slept with both women during his stay in Paris, but there is no real proof that either relationship occurred, and therefore the filmmakers wisely left that out.

    The lavish production values that you generally find in a Merchant/Ivory film are all here, but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair. I agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an African American family and yet their own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, has barely a role to play in the proceedings. There is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures. And I was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters. Nancy Marchand sounded very British for what one assumes is a French nun. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is. One moment she is slapping a slave, and another moment, she's deploring the whole system of slavery.
