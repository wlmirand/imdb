 <sinopse>
  A father becomes worried when a local gangster befriends his son in the Bronx in the 1960s.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Gangster Sonny is the big man in the Bronx neighborhood of an Italian small boy named Calogero. A shooting witnessed by the boy (nicknamed C) is the starting point of a lasting bond between the gangster and the boy. Father (bus driver Lorenzo), however, disapproves. C grows up under the wing of both men, torn between his own natural honesty and his fascination with Sonny. C's neighborhood cronies get involved in theft, use of guns, and racial fights. When C falls for an African American girl, things don't get any easier. C's leap to manhood is marked by tragedy, but also by his recognition of the many faces of love.

    It is really an emotional movie, the story is totally overwhelming and generally there are three reason I was touched by it. Firstly, the roles in the story cheer me up. I was used to be called "C" by my friends as well, exactly same as "C" in the movie. It seems that I find myself sometimes when watching the movie. Admired the cool guys or gangsters since I was a child. Respecting our father no matter when, because we trust them, we are proud of them. Being very shy when falling love with a girl but daring to do everything to get her. "C" is not a gangster, not a bad guy, he gets a great deal of conscience. Sunny is the boss of local gangster, everyone fears him, but also some of them respect him. What the difference between Sunny and other gangsters is he knows exactly the life, so he insists that "C" should not repeat his life rather than taking over from him. Secondly this movie also reflects the serious discrimination in American. Black people and white guys are water and fire. However "C" bravely steps out of the red line when he came across his love. He loves the girl without discrimination although he grew up in an environment teaching him to spite colour people. Finally, as said in the movie that you will understand when you grow up, it's a long way to go, from ignorant to knowledgeable, it is a process of life. You don't need to know what is this, what is going on right now, why it happens or what we should do at the very present time. But you need to make sure you will understand one day when you grow up. Like this word, "it's easy to make people fear of you but it's not easy to make them respect you. Only when they respect you, you are the real boss.

    I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre and there are very few titles I have not yet seen, but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt, that title would have to be a Bronx Tale. A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri, who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio, the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello, played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina, played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci, are the parents of a son named Calogero. We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years, as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him "C". This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C, causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C, and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man, loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny, and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    This was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut. I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11

    Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life. Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome "Hell's Angels" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl. Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings. No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.

    Searching around my local CEX store for any movies that had come out in 1993 which I could watch for a best of 1993 poll being held on the Classic Film board,I was pleased to find the DVD to a movie that Robert De Nero had made with Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking a look online,I was initially disappointed to discover that I had actually picked up a completely different film to the one that I had presumed it to be!, (with the Dicaprio and De Nero 1993 title being This Boy's Life) but with having really enjoyed last seeing Chazz Palminteri (who along with writing and co-starring in the movie,also wrote and acted in the play to which it is based on) in the classic Neo-Noir The Usual Suspects,I decided to make the most of my mistake,and got ready to see Palminteri and De Nero bring The Bronx to life. The plot: 1960: Finding his dads blue collar job of being a bus driver to lack the bright lights that he dreams of, 9 year old Calogero Anello sits on the steps outside the families block of flats and admires the sharp suit wearing guys who "control" The Bronx,with Anello being in complete awe of the gangs leader: Sonny LoSpecchio,who is admired and respected by everyone in the area. Desperate in finding any way to grab Sonny's attention,Calogero decides to show that he can be trusted,by lying to the police over witnessing a shooting that LoSpecchio was involved in.Impressed by Anello's display of solidarity,Sonny decides to offer Calogero the chance to work at a near by bar that he owns.Before getting the chance to answer LoSpecchio's invitation,Calogero is gripped by his dad Lorenzo Anello,who tells his son that he does not want to see him around Sonny ever again.Sadly for Lorenzo,the temptation to be around his idol every day is something that Calogero finds impossible to resist. View on the film: Placed right in the middle of the mean streets of The Bronx,Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, (who sadly ruined everything that he showed here by being involved in a robbery that led to the death of a police officer,and also caused Brancato to be sent to jail for 10 years) each give brilliant performances as the 9 and 17 year old versions of Calogero Anello,with Brancato expanding on the awe that Calogero is caught in when he sees Sonny for the first time,by slowly revealing the pedestal that Calogero puts LoSpecchio on now forms the centre of his entire life. Revealing an unexpected melancholy,and backed by an excellent Do-Wop heavy soundtrack,debuting director/co-star Robert De Nero shows an impressive amount of restrain with the violence in the movie,which helps De Nero to give the film a terrific rites of passage,Autumn atmosphere,as Calogero has to decide if he wants to be flawed and human like his dad, (played with a real blue collar-ness by De Nero) or if he wants to be like the near mythical person he has created in LoSpecchio. Whilst the melancholy mood does allow De Nero to create a near mythical atmosphere,it also leads to some of the more "challenging" issues that the movie looks at, (such as racism) to feel just a little bit too glossy and neatly wrapped up. Getting the chance to put his autobiographical one man play onto the big screen,writer/co-star Chazz Palminteri shows that he has not lost any of his focus or passion in the transferring of medium,of his amazing story,with Palminteri's smart screenplay keeping everything at a very low,earthy level which helps to create a real intimacy and strong,natural bond between each of the contrasting characters,as Chazz also gives a very charismatic performance as LoSpecchio,who is shown to be keep his real self hidden in a gangster's shell,which leads to to Palminteri and De Nero being excellent guides,who allow the viewer to feel the full,clever wrap around sting beginning and ending,of this sharp Bronx tail.

    It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.

    "A Bronx Tale" appears on neo-noir lists, which is why I watched it. I was amazed to find out that it's a terrific morality and coming-of-age story, which is the opposite of a neo-noir. This movie has no bad notes and all kinds of good notes. De Niro's son is seen at two different ages, and the actors look alike and look like De Niro and his wife. Neither young actor upstaged the other. Certainly great credit has to go to writer Palminteri and director De Niro. The main message of the story is to find and develop one's unique talents. In other words, find your calling. After seeing it, I began to ponder the callings of people close to me. The story revolves around a bus driver's son who finds a mentor in the local gang boss. At both ages, the boy must struggle with becoming his own man, making moral choices and also dealing with the pressures from his close friends in the neighborhood. He must also deal with ethnic and racial frictions. This all produces a natural suspense that holds to the very last frame. "A Bronx Tale" is a gem.

    We've been down this road before: impressionable young man from modest means in the 1960s is attracted to the flashy gangsters in his hometown; his father disapproves. Collaborative effort from producer-director-star Robert De Niro and screenwriter and co-star Chazz Palminteri (adapting his own play) could very well strike some as twee were it not for some well-played scenes in the beginning and a heartfelt conclusion. De Niro, making his debut behind the camera, works well mainly with the younger players--which is surprising--however his performance as a family man and bus driver is curiously muted and tentative. Palminteri seems encouraged to play to the rafters; while the actor strikes a charismatic presence, and is effective much of the time, less of him is more. Nostalgic trimmings help, though the period flavor is ultimately haphazardly captured. **1/2 from ****

    For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    This was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut. I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11

    Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life. Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome "Hell's Angels" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl. Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings. No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.

    Searching around my local CEX store for any movies that had come out in 1993 which I could watch for a best of 1993 poll being held on the Classic Film board,I was pleased to find the DVD to a movie that Robert De Nero had made with Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking a look online,I was initially disappointed to discover that I had actually picked up a completely different film to the one that I had presumed it to be!, (with the Dicaprio and De Nero 1993 title being This Boy's Life) but with having really enjoyed last seeing Chazz Palminteri (who along with writing and co-starring in the movie,also wrote and acted in the play to which it is based on) in the classic Neo-Noir The Usual Suspects,I decided to make the most of my mistake,and got ready to see Palminteri and De Nero bring The Bronx to life. The plot: 1960: Finding his dads blue collar job of being a bus driver to lack the bright lights that he dreams of, 9 year old Calogero Anello sits on the steps outside the families block of flats and admires the sharp suit wearing guys who "control" The Bronx,with Anello being in complete awe of the gangs leader: Sonny LoSpecchio,who is admired and respected by everyone in the area. Desperate in finding any way to grab Sonny's attention,Calogero decides to show that he can be trusted,by lying to the police over witnessing a shooting that LoSpecchio was involved in.Impressed by Anello's display of solidarity,Sonny decides to offer Calogero the chance to work at a near by bar that he owns.Before getting the chance to answer LoSpecchio's invitation,Calogero is gripped by his dad Lorenzo Anello,who tells his son that he does not want to see him around Sonny ever again.Sadly for Lorenzo,the temptation to be around his idol every day is something that Calogero finds impossible to resist. View on the film: Placed right in the middle of the mean streets of The Bronx,Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, (who sadly ruined everything that he showed here by being involved in a robbery that led to the death of a police officer,and also caused Brancato to be sent to jail for 10 years) each give brilliant performances as the 9 and 17 year old versions of Calogero Anello,with Brancato expanding on the awe that Calogero is caught in when he sees Sonny for the first time,by slowly revealing the pedestal that Calogero puts LoSpecchio on now forms the centre of his entire life. Revealing an unexpected melancholy,and backed by an excellent Do-Wop heavy soundtrack,debuting director/co-star Robert De Nero shows an impressive amount of restrain with the violence in the movie,which helps De Nero to give the film a terrific rites of passage,Autumn atmosphere,as Calogero has to decide if he wants to be flawed and human like his dad, (played with a real blue collar-ness by De Nero) or if he wants to be like the near mythical person he has created in LoSpecchio. Whilst the melancholy mood does allow De Nero to create a near mythical atmosphere,it also leads to some of the more "challenging" issues that the movie looks at, (such as racism) to feel just a little bit too glossy and neatly wrapped up. Getting the chance to put his autobiographical one man play onto the big screen,writer/co-star Chazz Palminteri shows that he has not lost any of his focus or passion in the transferring of medium,of his amazing story,with Palminteri's smart screenplay keeping everything at a very low,earthy level which helps to create a real intimacy and strong,natural bond between each of the contrasting characters,as Chazz also gives a very charismatic performance as LoSpecchio,who is shown to be keep his real self hidden in a gangster's shell,which leads to to Palminteri and De Nero being excellent guides,who allow the viewer to feel the full,clever wrap around sting beginning and ending,of this sharp Bronx tail.

    It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.

    "A Bronx Tale" appears on neo-noir lists, which is why I watched it. I was amazed to find out that it's a terrific morality and coming-of-age story, which is the opposite of a neo-noir. This movie has no bad notes and all kinds of good notes. De Niro's son is seen at two different ages, and the actors look alike and look like De Niro and his wife. Neither young actor upstaged the other. Certainly great credit has to go to writer Palminteri and director De Niro. The main message of the story is to find and develop one's unique talents. In other words, find your calling. After seeing it, I began to ponder the callings of people close to me. The story revolves around a bus driver's son who finds a mentor in the local gang boss. At both ages, the boy must struggle with becoming his own man, making moral choices and also dealing with the pressures from his close friends in the neighborhood. He must also deal with ethnic and racial frictions. This all produces a natural suspense that holds to the very last frame. "A Bronx Tale" is a gem.

    We've been down this road before: impressionable young man from modest means in the 1960s is attracted to the flashy gangsters in his hometown; his father disapproves. Collaborative effort from producer-director-star Robert De Niro and screenwriter and co-star Chazz Palminteri (adapting his own play) could very well strike some as twee were it not for some well-played scenes in the beginning and a heartfelt conclusion. De Niro, making his debut behind the camera, works well mainly with the younger players--which is surprising--however his performance as a family man and bus driver is curiously muted and tentative. Palminteri seems encouraged to play to the rafters; while the actor strikes a charismatic presence, and is effective much of the time, less of him is more. Nostalgic trimmings help, though the period flavor is ultimately haphazardly captured. **1/2 from ****

    For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

    It is really an emotional movie, the story is totally overwhelming and generally there are three reason I was touched by it. Firstly, the roles in the story cheer me up. I was used to be called "C" by my friends as well, exactly same as "C" in the movie. It seems that I find myself sometimes when watching the movie. Admired the cool guys or gangsters since I was a child. Respecting our father no matter when, because we trust them, we are proud of them. Being very shy when falling love with a girl but daring to do everything to get her. "C" is not a gangster, not a bad guy, he gets a great deal of conscience. Sunny is the boss of local gangster, everyone fears him, but also some of them respect him. What the difference between Sunny and other gangsters is he knows exactly the life, so he insists that "C" should not repeat his life rather than taking over from him. Secondly this movie also reflects the serious discrimination in American. Black people and white guys are water and fire. However "C" bravely steps out of the red line when he came across his love. He loves the girl without discrimination although he grew up in an environment teaching him to spite colour people. Finally, as said in the movie that you will understand when you grow up, it's a long way to go, from ignorant to knowledgeable, it is a process of life. You don't need to know what is this, what is going on right now, why it happens or what we should do at the very present time. But you need to make sure you will understand one day when you grow up. Like this word, "it's easy to make people fear of you but it's not easy to make them respect you. Only when they respect you, you are the real boss.

    a strange case of what- to be kind- is unintentional plagiarism; consider goodfellas, the first sections, out in 1990, and this one 3 years later; goodfellas tracks a kid growing up near a mafia club-hangout; so does bronx tale; goodfellas show the conflict of the kid facing strict parents who don't want him associating with the hoods; so does bronx tale; the kid grows up enamored of the local mafia boss in goodfellas, geez what a surprise, so does bronx tale; etc.; also, kid in goodfellas was a natural; little kid in brox tale is too little and too wussy to have meaning, and actor who plays him as a teen has no stage presence, a monolithic expression and delivery; finally- if you can wait that long- the different twist is, somehow, the bronx tale kid becomes suddenly fond of ablack girl and it's race relations; sure; deniro walking through another part, wife is good, mafia boos is good, plot is 75% steal

    I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre and there are very few titles I have not yet seen, but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt, that title would have to be a Bronx Tale. A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri, who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio, the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello, played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina, played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci, are the parents of a son named Calogero. We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years, as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him "C". This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C, causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C, and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man, loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny, and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.

    "A Bronx Tale" appears on neo-noir lists, which is why I watched it. I was amazed to find out that it's a terrific morality and coming-of-age story, which is the opposite of a neo-noir. This movie has no bad notes and all kinds of good notes. De Niro's son is seen at two different ages, and the actors look alike and look like De Niro and his wife. Neither young actor upstaged the other. Certainly great credit has to go to writer Palminteri and director De Niro. The main message of the story is to find and develop one's unique talents. In other words, find your calling. After seeing it, I began to ponder the callings of people close to me. The story revolves around a bus driver's son who finds a mentor in the local gang boss. At both ages, the boy must struggle with becoming his own man, making moral choices and also dealing with the pressures from his close friends in the neighborhood. He must also deal with ethnic and racial frictions. This all produces a natural suspense that holds to the very last frame. "A Bronx Tale" is a gem.

    We've been down this road before: impressionable young man from modest means in the 1960s is attracted to the flashy gangsters in his hometown; his father disapproves. Collaborative effort from producer-director-star Robert De Niro and screenwriter and co-star Chazz Palminteri (adapting his own play) could very well strike some as twee were it not for some well-played scenes in the beginning and a heartfelt conclusion. De Niro, making his debut behind the camera, works well mainly with the younger players--which is surprising--however his performance as a family man and bus driver is curiously muted and tentative. Palminteri seems encouraged to play to the rafters; while the actor strikes a charismatic presence, and is effective much of the time, less of him is more. Nostalgic trimmings help, though the period flavor is ultimately haphazardly captured. **1/2 from ****

    For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

    It is really an emotional movie, the story is totally overwhelming and generally there are three reason I was touched by it. Firstly, the roles in the story cheer me up. I was used to be called "C" by my friends as well, exactly same as "C" in the movie. It seems that I find myself sometimes when watching the movie. Admired the cool guys or gangsters since I was a child. Respecting our father no matter when, because we trust them, we are proud of them. Being very shy when falling love with a girl but daring to do everything to get her. "C" is not a gangster, not a bad guy, he gets a great deal of conscience. Sunny is the boss of local gangster, everyone fears him, but also some of them respect him. What the difference between Sunny and other gangsters is he knows exactly the life, so he insists that "C" should not repeat his life rather than taking over from him. Secondly this movie also reflects the serious discrimination in American. Black people and white guys are water and fire. However "C" bravely steps out of the red line when he came across his love. He loves the girl without discrimination although he grew up in an environment teaching him to spite colour people. Finally, as said in the movie that you will understand when you grow up, it's a long way to go, from ignorant to knowledgeable, it is a process of life. You don't need to know what is this, what is going on right now, why it happens or what we should do at the very present time. But you need to make sure you will understand one day when you grow up. Like this word, "it's easy to make people fear of you but it's not easy to make them respect you. Only when they respect you, you are the real boss.

    a strange case of what- to be kind- is unintentional plagiarism; consider goodfellas, the first sections, out in 1990, and this one 3 years later; goodfellas tracks a kid growing up near a mafia club-hangout; so does bronx tale; goodfellas show the conflict of the kid facing strict parents who don't want him associating with the hoods; so does bronx tale; the kid grows up enamored of the local mafia boss in goodfellas, geez what a surprise, so does bronx tale; etc.; also, kid in goodfellas was a natural; little kid in brox tale is too little and too wussy to have meaning, and actor who plays him as a teen has no stage presence, a monolithic expression and delivery; finally- if you can wait that long- the different twist is, somehow, the bronx tale kid becomes suddenly fond of ablack girl and it's race relations; sure; deniro walking through another part, wife is good, mafia boos is good, plot is 75% steal

    I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre and there are very few titles I have not yet seen, but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt, that title would have to be a Bronx Tale. A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri, who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio, the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello, played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina, played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci, are the parents of a son named Calogero. We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years, as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him "C". This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C, causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C, and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man, loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny, and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    This was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut. I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11

    Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life. Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome "Hell's Angels" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl. Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings. No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.

    Searching around my local CEX store for any movies that had come out in 1993 which I could watch for a best of 1993 poll being held on the Classic Film board,I was pleased to find the DVD to a movie that Robert De Nero had made with Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking a look online,I was initially disappointed to discover that I had actually picked up a completely different film to the one that I had presumed it to be!, (with the Dicaprio and De Nero 1993 title being This Boy's Life) but with having really enjoyed last seeing Chazz Palminteri (who along with writing and co-starring in the movie,also wrote and acted in the play to which it is based on) in the classic Neo-Noir The Usual Suspects,I decided to make the most of my mistake,and got ready to see Palminteri and De Nero bring The Bronx to life. The plot: 1960: Finding his dads blue collar job of being a bus driver to lack the bright lights that he dreams of, 9 year old Calogero Anello sits on the steps outside the families block of flats and admires the sharp suit wearing guys who "control" The Bronx,with Anello being in complete awe of the gangs leader: Sonny LoSpecchio,who is admired and respected by everyone in the area. Desperate in finding any way to grab Sonny's attention,Calogero decides to show that he can be trusted,by lying to the police over witnessing a shooting that LoSpecchio was involved in.Impressed by Anello's display of solidarity,Sonny decides to offer Calogero the chance to work at a near by bar that he owns.Before getting the chance to answer LoSpecchio's invitation,Calogero is gripped by his dad Lorenzo Anello,who tells his son that he does not want to see him around Sonny ever again.Sadly for Lorenzo,the temptation to be around his idol every day is something that Calogero finds impossible to resist. View on the film: Placed right in the middle of the mean streets of The Bronx,Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, (who sadly ruined everything that he showed here by being involved in a robbery that led to the death of a police officer,and also caused Brancato to be sent to jail for 10 years) each give brilliant performances as the 9 and 17 year old versions of Calogero Anello,with Brancato expanding on the awe that Calogero is caught in when he sees Sonny for the first time,by slowly revealing the pedestal that Calogero puts LoSpecchio on now forms the centre of his entire life. Revealing an unexpected melancholy,and backed by an excellent Do-Wop heavy soundtrack,debuting director/co-star Robert De Nero shows an impressive amount of restrain with the violence in the movie,which helps De Nero to give the film a terrific rites of passage,Autumn atmosphere,as Calogero has to decide if he wants to be flawed and human like his dad, (played with a real blue collar-ness by De Nero) or if he wants to be like the near mythical person he has created in LoSpecchio. Whilst the melancholy mood does allow De Nero to create a near mythical atmosphere,it also leads to some of the more "challenging" issues that the movie looks at, (such as racism) to feel just a little bit too glossy and neatly wrapped up. Getting the chance to put his autobiographical one man play onto the big screen,writer/co-star Chazz Palminteri shows that he has not lost any of his focus or passion in the transferring of medium,of his amazing story,with Palminteri's smart screenplay keeping everything at a very low,earthy level which helps to create a real intimacy and strong,natural bond between each of the contrasting characters,as Chazz also gives a very charismatic performance as LoSpecchio,who is shown to be keep his real self hidden in a gangster's shell,which leads to to Palminteri and De Nero being excellent guides,who allow the viewer to feel the full,clever wrap around sting beginning and ending,of this sharp Bronx tail.

De Niro, making his debut behind the camera, works well mainly with the younger players--which is surprising--however his performance as a family man and bus driver is curiously muted and tentative. Palminteri seems encouraged to play to the rafters; while the actor strikes a charismatic presence, and is effective much of the time, less of him is more. Nostalgic trimmings help, though the period flavor is ultimately haphazardly captured. **1/2 from ****

    For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

    It is really an emotional movie, the story is totally overwhelming and generally there are three reason I was touched by it. Firstly, the roles in the story cheer me up. I was used to be called "C" by my friends as well, exactly same as "C" in the movie. It seems that I find myself sometimes when watching the movie. Admired the cool guys or gangsters since I was a child. Respecting our father no matter when, because we trust them, we are proud of them. Being very shy when falling love with a girl but daring to do everything to get her. "C" is not a gangster, not a bad guy, he gets a great deal of conscience. Sunny is the boss of local gangster, everyone fears him, but also some of them respect him. What the difference between Sunny and other gangsters is he knows exactly the life, so he insists that "C" should not repeat his life rather than taking over from him. Secondly this movie also reflects the serious discrimination in American. Black people and white guys are water and fire. However "C" bravely steps out of the red line when he came across his love. He loves the girl without discrimination although he grew up in an environment teaching him to spite colour people. Finally, as said in the movie that you will understand when you grow up, it's a long way to go, from ignorant to knowledgeable, it is a process of life. You don't need to know what is this, what is going on right now, why it happens or what we should do at the very present time. But you need to make sure you will understand one day when you grow up. Like this word, "it's easy to make people fear of you but it's not easy to make them respect you. Only when they respect you, you are the real boss.

    I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre and there are very few titles I have not yet seen, but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt, that title would have to be a Bronx Tale. A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri, who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio, the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello, played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina, played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci, are the parents of a son named Calogero. We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years, as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him "C". This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C, causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C, and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man, loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny, and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    This was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut. I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11

    Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life. Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome "Hell's Angels" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl. Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings. No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.

    Searching around my local CEX store for any movies that had come out in 1993 which I could watch for a best of 1993 poll being held on the Classic Film board,I was pleased to find the DVD to a movie that Robert De Nero had made with Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking a look online,I was initially disappointed to discover that I had actually picked up a completely different film to the one that I had presumed it to be!, (with the Dicaprio and De Nero 1993 title being This Boy's Life) but with having really enjoyed last seeing Chazz Palminteri (who along with writing and co-starring in the movie,also wrote and acted in the play to which it is based on) in the classic Neo-Noir The Usual Suspects,I decided to make the most of my mistake,and got ready to see Palminteri and De Nero bring The Bronx to life. The plot: 1960: Finding his dads blue collar job of being a bus driver to lack the bright lights that he dreams of, 9 year old Calogero Anello sits on the steps outside the families block of flats and admires the sharp suit wearing guys who "control" The Bronx,with Anello being in complete awe of the gangs leader: Sonny LoSpecchio,who is admired and respected by everyone in the area. Desperate in finding any way to grab Sonny's attention,Calogero decides to show that he can be trusted,by lying to the police over witnessing a shooting that LoSpecchio was involved in.Impressed by Anello's display of solidarity,Sonny decides to offer Calogero the chance to work at a near by bar that he owns.Before getting the chance to answer LoSpecchio's invitation,Calogero is gripped by his dad Lorenzo Anello,who tells his son that he does not want to see him around Sonny ever again.Sadly for Lorenzo,the temptation to be around his idol every day is something that Calogero finds impossible to resist. View on the film: Placed right in the middle of the mean streets of The Bronx,Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, (who sadly ruined everything that he showed here by being involved in a robbery that led to the death of a police officer,and also caused Brancato to be sent to jail for 10 years) each give brilliant performances as the 9 and 17 year old versions of Calogero Anello,with Brancato expanding on the awe that Calogero is caught in when he sees Sonny for the first time,by slowly revealing the pedestal that Calogero puts LoSpecchio on now forms the centre of his entire life. Revealing an unexpected melancholy,and backed by an excellent Do-Wop heavy soundtrack,debuting director/co-star Robert De Nero shows an impressive amount of restrain with the violence in the movie,which helps De Nero to give the film a terrific rites of passage,Autumn atmosphere,as Calogero has to decide if he wants to be flawed and human like his dad, (played with a real blue collar-ness by De Nero) or if he wants to be like the near mythical person he has created in LoSpecchio. Whilst the melancholy mood does allow De Nero to create a near mythical atmosphere,it also leads to some of the more "challenging" issues that the movie looks at, (such as racism) to feel just a little bit too glossy and neatly wrapped up. Getting the chance to put his autobiographical one man play onto the big screen,writer/co-star Chazz Palminteri shows that he has not lost any of his focus or passion in the transferring of medium,of his amazing story,with Palminteri's smart screenplay keeping everything at a very low,earthy level which helps to create a real intimacy and strong,natural bond between each of the contrasting characters,as Chazz also gives a very charismatic performance as LoSpecchio,who is shown to be keep his real self hidden in a gangster's shell,which leads to to Palminteri and De Nero being excellent guides,who allow the viewer to feel the full,clever wrap around sting beginning and ending,of this sharp Bronx tail.

    It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.

    "A Bronx Tale" appears on neo-noir lists, which is why I watched it. I was amazed to find out that it's a terrific morality and coming-of-age story, which is the opposite of a neo-noir. This movie has no bad notes and all kinds of good notes. De Niro's son is seen at two different ages, and the actors look alike and look like De Niro and his wife. Neither young actor upstaged the other. Certainly great credit has to go to writer Palminteri and director De Niro. The main message of the story is to find and develop one's unique talents. In other words, find your calling. After seeing it, I began to ponder the callings of people close to me. The story revolves around a bus driver's son who finds a mentor in the local gang boss. At both ages, the boy must struggle with becoming his own man, making moral choices and also dealing with the pressures from his close friends in the neighborhood. He must also deal with ethnic and racial frictions. This all produces a natural suspense that holds to the very last frame. "A Bronx Tale" is a gem.

The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    This was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut. I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11

    Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life. Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome "Hell's Angels" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl. Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings. No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.

    Searching around my local CEX store for any movies that had come out in 1993 which I could watch for a best of 1993 poll being held on the Classic Film board,I was pleased to find the DVD to a movie that Robert De Nero had made with Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking a look online,I was initially disappointed to discover that I had actually picked up a completely different film to the one that I had presumed it to be!, (with the Dicaprio and De Nero 1993 title being This Boy's Life) but with having really enjoyed last seeing Chazz Palminteri (who along with writing and co-starring in the movie,also wrote and acted in the play to which it is based on) in the classic Neo-Noir The Usual Suspects,I decided to make the most of my mistake,and got ready to see Palminteri and De Nero bring The Bronx to life. The plot: 1960: Finding his dads blue collar job of being a bus driver to lack the bright lights that he dreams of, 9 year old Calogero Anello sits on the steps outside the families block of flats and admires the sharp suit wearing guys who "control" The Bronx,with Anello being in complete awe of the gangs leader: Sonny LoSpecchio,who is admired and respected by everyone in the area. Desperate in finding any way to grab Sonny's attention,Calogero decides to show that he can be trusted,by lying to the police over witnessing a shooting that LoSpecchio was involved in.Impressed by Anello's display of solidarity,Sonny decides to offer Calogero the chance to work at a near by bar that he owns.Before getting the chance to answer LoSpecchio's invitation,Calogero is gripped by his dad Lorenzo Anello,who tells his son that he does not want to see him around Sonny ever again.Sadly for Lorenzo,the temptation to be around his idol every day is something that Calogero finds impossible to resist. View on the film: Placed right in the middle of the mean streets of The Bronx,Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, (who sadly ruined everything that he showed here by being involved in a robbery that led to the death of a police officer,and also caused Brancato to be sent to jail for 10 years) each give brilliant performances as the 9 and 17 year old versions of Calogero Anello,with Brancato expanding on the awe that Calogero is caught in when he sees Sonny for the first time,by slowly revealing the pedestal that Calogero puts LoSpecchio on now forms the centre of his entire life. Revealing an unexpected melancholy,and backed by an excellent Do-Wop heavy soundtrack,debuting director/co-star Robert De Nero shows an impressive amount of restrain with the violence in the movie,which helps De Nero to give the film a terrific rites of passage,Autumn atmosphere,as Calogero has to decide if he wants to be flawed and human like his dad, (played with a real blue collar-ness by De Nero) or if he wants to be like the near mythical person he has created in LoSpecchio. Whilst the melancholy mood does allow De Nero to create a near mythical atmosphere,it also leads to some of the more "challenging" issues that the movie looks at, (such as racism) to feel just a little bit too glossy and neatly wrapped up. Getting the chance to put his autobiographical one man play onto the big screen,writer/co-star Chazz Palminteri shows that he has not lost any of his focus or passion in the transferring of medium,of his amazing story,with Palminteri's smart screenplay keeping everything at a very low,earthy level which helps to create a real intimacy and strong,natural bond between each of the contrasting characters,as Chazz also gives a very charismatic performance as LoSpecchio,who is shown to be keep his real self hidden in a gangster's shell,which leads to to Palminteri and De Nero being excellent guides,who allow the viewer to feel the full,clever wrap around sting beginning and ending,of this sharp Bronx tail.

    It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.

    "A Bronx Tale" appears on neo-noir lists, which is why I watched it. I was amazed to find out that it's a terrific morality and coming-of-age story, which is the opposite of a neo-noir. This movie has no bad notes and all kinds of good notes. De Niro's son is seen at two different ages, and the actors look alike and look like De Niro and his wife. Neither young actor upstaged the other. Certainly great credit has to go to writer Palminteri and director De Niro. The main message of the story is to find and develop one's unique talents. In other words, find your calling. After seeing it, I began to ponder the callings of people close to me. The story revolves around a bus driver's son who finds a mentor in the local gang boss. At both ages, the boy must struggle with becoming his own man, making moral choices and also dealing with the pressures from his close friends in the neighborhood. He must also deal with ethnic and racial frictions. This all produces a natural suspense that holds to the very last frame. "A Bronx Tale" is a gem.

    We've been down this road before: impressionable young man from modest means in the 1960s is attracted to the flashy gangsters in his hometown; his father disapproves. Collaborative effort from producer-director-star Robert De Niro and screenwriter and co-star Chazz Palminteri (adapting his own play) could very well strike some as twee were it not for some well-played scenes in the beginning and a heartfelt conclusion. De Niro, making his debut behind the camera, works well mainly with the younger players--which is surprising--however his performance as a family man and bus driver is curiously muted and tentative. Palminteri seems encouraged to play to the rafters; while the actor strikes a charismatic presence, and is effective much of the time, less of him is more. Nostalgic trimmings help, though the period flavor is ultimately haphazardly captured. **1/2 from ****

    For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

    It is really an emotional movie, the story is totally overwhelming and generally there are three reason I was touched by it. Firstly, the roles in the story cheer me up. I was used to be called "C" by my friends as well, exactly same as "C" in the movie. It seems that I find myself sometimes when watching the movie. Admired the cool guys or gangsters since I was a child. Respecting our father no matter when, because we trust them, we are proud of them. Being very shy when falling love with a girl but daring to do everything to get her. "C" is not a gangster, not a bad guy, he gets a great deal of conscience. Sunny is the boss of local gangster, everyone fears him, but also some of them respect him. What the difference between Sunny and other gangsters is he knows exactly the life, so he insists that "C" should not repeat his life rather than taking over from him. Secondly this movie also reflects the serious discrimination in American. Black people and white guys are water and fire. However "C" bravely steps out of the red line when he came across his love. He loves the girl without discrimination although he grew up in an environment teaching him to spite colour people. Finally, as said in the movie that you will understand when you grow up, it's a long way to go, from ignorant to knowledgeable, it is a process of life. You don't need to know what is this, what is going on right now, why it happens or what we should do at the very present time. But you need to make sure you will understand one day when you grow up. Like this word, "it's easy to make people fear of you but it's not easy to make them respect you. Only when they respect you, you are the real boss.

    a strange case of what- to be kind- is unintentional plagiarism; consider goodfellas, the first sections, out in 1990, and this one 3 years later; goodfellas tracks a kid growing up near a mafia club-hangout; so does bronx tale; goodfellas show the conflict of the kid facing strict parents who don't want him associating with the hoods; so does bronx tale; the kid grows up enamored of the local mafia boss in goodfellas, geez what a surprise, so does bronx tale; etc.; also, kid in goodfellas was a natural; little kid in brox tale is too little and too wussy to have meaning, and actor who plays him as a teen has no stage presence, a monolithic expression and delivery; finally- if you can wait that long- the different twist is, somehow, the bronx tale kid becomes suddenly fond of ablack girl and it's race relations; sure; deniro walking through another part, wife is good, mafia boos is good, plot is 75% steal

    I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre and there are very few titles I have not yet seen, but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt, that title would have to be a Bronx Tale. A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri, who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio, the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello, played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina, played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci, are the parents of a son named Calogero. We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years, as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him "C". This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C, causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C, and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man, loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny, and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.

    "A Bronx Tale" appears on neo-noir lists, which is why I watched it. I was amazed to find out that it's a terrific morality and coming-of-age story, which is the opposite of a neo-noir. This movie has no bad notes and all kinds of good notes. De Niro's son is seen at two different ages, and the actors look alike and look like De Niro and his wife. Neither young actor upstaged the other. Certainly great credit has to go to writer Palminteri and director De Niro. The main message of the story is to find and develop one's unique talents. In other words, find your calling. After seeing it, I began to ponder the callings of people close to me. The story revolves around a bus driver's son who finds a mentor in the local gang boss. At both ages, the boy must struggle with becoming his own man, making moral choices and also dealing with the pressures from his close friends in the neighborhood. He must also deal with ethnic and racial frictions. This all produces a natural suspense that holds to the very last frame. "A Bronx Tale" is a gem.

    We've been down this road before: impressionable young man from modest means in the 1960s is attracted to the flashy gangsters in his hometown; his father disapproves. Collaborative effort from producer-director-star Robert De Niro and screenwriter and co-star Chazz Palminteri (adapting his own play) could very well strike some as twee were it not for some well-played scenes in the beginning and a heartfelt conclusion. De Niro, making his debut behind the camera, works well mainly with the younger players--which is surprising--however his performance as a family man and bus driver is curiously muted and tentative. Palminteri seems encouraged to play to the rafters; while the actor strikes a charismatic presence, and is effective much of the time, less of him is more. Nostalgic trimmings help, though the period flavor is ultimately haphazardly captured. **1/2 from ****

    For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

    It is really an emotional movie, the story is totally overwhelming and generally there are three reason I was touched by it. Firstly, the roles in the story cheer me up. I was used to be called "C" by my friends as well, exactly same as "C" in the movie. It seems that I find myself sometimes when watching the movie. Admired the cool guys or gangsters since I was a child. Respecting our father no matter when, because we trust them, we are proud of them. Being very shy when falling love with a girl but daring to do everything to get her. "C" is not a gangster, not a bad guy, he gets a great deal of conscience. Sunny is the boss of local gangster, everyone fears him, but also some of them respect him. What the difference between Sunny and other gangsters is he knows exactly the life, so he insists that "C" should not repeat his life rather than taking over from him. Secondly this movie also reflects the serious discrimination in American. Black people and white guys are water and fire. However "C" bravely steps out of the red line when he came across his love. He loves the girl without discrimination although he grew up in an environment teaching him to spite colour people. Finally, as said in the movie that you will understand when you grow up, it's a long way to go, from ignorant to knowledgeable, it is a process of life. You don't need to know what is this, what is going on right now, why it happens or what we should do at the very present time. But you need to make sure you will understand one day when you grow up. Like this word, "it's easy to make people fear of you but it's not easy to make them respect you. Only when they respect you, you are the real boss.

    a strange case of what- to be kind- is unintentional plagiarism; consider goodfellas, the first sections, out in 1990, and this one 3 years later; goodfellas tracks a kid growing up near a mafia club-hangout; so does bronx tale; goodfellas show the conflict of the kid facing strict parents who don't want him associating with the hoods; so does bronx tale; the kid grows up enamored of the local mafia boss in goodfellas, geez what a surprise, so does bronx tale; etc.; also, kid in goodfellas was a natural; little kid in brox tale is too little and too wussy to have meaning, and actor who plays him as a teen has no stage presence, a monolithic expression and delivery; finally- if you can wait that long- the different twist is, somehow, the bronx tale kid becomes suddenly fond of ablack girl and it's race relations; sure; deniro walking through another part, wife is good, mafia boos is good, plot is 75% steal

    I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre and there are very few titles I have not yet seen, but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt, that title would have to be a Bronx Tale. A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri, who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio, the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello, played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina, played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci, are the parents of a son named Calogero. We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years, as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him "C". This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C, causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C, and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man, loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny, and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    This was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut. I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11

    Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life. Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome "Hell's Angels" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl. Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings. No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.

    Searching around my local CEX store for any movies that had come out in 1993 which I could watch for a best of 1993 poll being held on the Classic Film board,I was pleased to find the DVD to a movie that Robert De Nero had made with Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking a look online,I was initially disappointed to discover that I had actually picked up a completely different film to the one that I had presumed it to be!, (with the Dicaprio and De Nero 1993 title being This Boy's Life) but with having really enjoyed last seeing Chazz Palminteri (who along with writing and co-starring in the movie,also wrote and acted in the play to which it is based on) in the classic Neo-Noir The Usual Suspects,I decided to make the most of my mistake,and got ready to see Palminteri and De Nero bring The Bronx to life. The plot: 1960: Finding his dads blue collar job of being a bus driver to lack the bright lights that he dreams of, 9 year old Calogero Anello sits on the steps outside the families block of flats and admires the sharp suit wearing guys who "control" The Bronx,with Anello being in complete awe of the gangs leader: Sonny LoSpecchio,who is admired and respected by everyone in the area. Desperate in finding any way to grab Sonny's attention,Calogero decides to show that he can be trusted,by lying to the police over witnessing a shooting that LoSpecchio was involved in.Impressed by Anello's display of solidarity,Sonny decides to offer Calogero the chance to work at a near by bar that he owns.Before getting the chance to answer LoSpecchio's invitation,Calogero is gripped by his dad Lorenzo Anello,who tells his son that he does not want to see him around Sonny ever again.Sadly for Lorenzo,the temptation to be around his idol every day is something that Calogero finds impossible to resist. View on the film: Placed right in the middle of the mean streets of The Bronx,Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, (who sadly ruined everything that he showed here by being involved in a robbery that led to the death of a police officer,and also caused Brancato to be sent to jail for 10 years) each give brilliant performances as the 9 and 17 year old versions of Calogero Anello,with Brancato expanding on the awe that Calogero is caught in when he sees Sonny for the first time,by slowly revealing the pedestal that Calogero puts LoSpecchio on now forms the centre of his entire life. Revealing an unexpected melancholy,and backed by an excellent Do-Wop heavy soundtrack,debuting director/co-star Robert De Nero shows an impressive amount of restrain with the violence in the movie,which helps De Nero to give the film a terrific rites of passage,Autumn atmosphere,as Calogero has to decide if he wants to be flawed and human like his dad, (played with a real blue collar-ness by De Nero) or if he wants to be like the near mythical person he has created in LoSpecchio. Whilst the melancholy mood does allow De Nero to create a near mythical atmosphere,it also leads to some of the more "challenging" issues that the movie looks at, (such as racism) to feel just a little bit too glossy and neatly wrapped up. Getting the chance to put his autobiographical one man play onto the big screen,writer/co-star Chazz Palminteri shows that he has not lost any of his focus or passion in the transferring of medium,of his amazing story,with Palminteri's smart screenplay keeping everything at a very low,earthy level which helps to create a real intimacy and strong,natural bond between each of the contrasting characters,as Chazz also gives a very charismatic performance as LoSpecchio,who is shown to be keep his real self hidden in a gangster's shell,which leads to to Palminteri and De Nero being excellent guides,who allow the viewer to feel the full,clever wrap around sting beginning and ending,of this sharp Bronx tail.

    We've been down this road before: impressionable young man from modest means in the 1960s is attracted to the flashy gangsters in his hometown; his father disapproves. Collaborative effort from producer-director-star Robert De Niro and screenwriter and co-star Chazz Palminteri (adapting his own play) could very well strike some as twee were it not for some well-played scenes in the beginning and a heartfelt conclusion. De Niro, making his debut behind the camera, works well mainly with the younger players--which is surprising--however his performance as a family man and bus driver is curiously muted and tentative. Palminteri seems encouraged to play to the rafters; while the actor strikes a charismatic presence, and is effective much of the time, less of him is more. Nostalgic trimmings help, though the period flavor is ultimately haphazardly captured. **1/2 from ****

    For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

    It is really an emotional movie, the story is totally overwhelming and generally there are three reason I was touched by it. Firstly, the roles in the story cheer me up. I was used to be called "C" by my friends as well, exactly same as "C" in the movie. It seems that I find myself sometimes when watching the movie. Admired the cool guys or gangsters since I was a child. Respecting our father no matter when, because we trust them, we are proud of them. Being very shy when falling love with a girl but daring to do everything to get her. "C" is not a gangster, not a bad guy, he gets a great deal of conscience. Sunny is the boss of local gangster, everyone fears him, but also some of them respect him. What the difference between Sunny and other gangsters is he knows exactly the life, so he insists that "C" should not repeat his life rather than taking over from him. Secondly this movie also reflects the serious discrimination in American. Black people and white guys are water and fire. However "C" bravely steps out of the red line when he came across his love. He loves the girl without discrimination although he grew up in an environment teaching him to spite colour people. Finally, as said in the movie that you will understand when you grow up, it's a long way to go, from ignorant to knowledgeable, it is a process of life. You don't need to know what is this, what is going on right now, why it happens or what we should do at the very present time. But you need to make sure you will understand one day when you grow up. Like this word, "it's easy to make people fear of you but it's not easy to make them respect you. Only when they respect you, you are the real boss.

    I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre and there are very few titles I have not yet seen, but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt, that title would have to be a Bronx Tale. A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri, who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio, the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello, played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina, played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci, are the parents of a son named Calogero. We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years, as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him "C". This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C, causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C, and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man, loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny, and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    This was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut. I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11

    Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life. Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome "Hell's Angels" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl. Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings. No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.

    Searching around my local CEX store for any movies that had come out in 1993 which I could watch for a best of 1993 poll being held on the Classic Film board,I was pleased to find the DVD to a movie that Robert De Nero had made with Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking a look online,I was initially disappointed to discover that I had actually picked up a completely different film to the one that I had presumed it to be!, (with the Dicaprio and De Nero 1993 title being This Boy's Life) but with having really enjoyed last seeing Chazz Palminteri (who along with writing and co-starring in the movie,also wrote and acted in the play to which it is based on) in the classic Neo-Noir The Usual Suspects,I decided to make the most of my mistake,and got ready to see Palminteri and De Nero bring The Bronx to life. The plot: 1960: Finding his dads blue collar job of being a bus driver to lack the bright lights that he dreams of, 9 year old Calogero Anello sits on the steps outside the families block of flats and admires the sharp suit wearing guys who "control" The Bronx,with Anello being in complete awe of the gangs leader: Sonny LoSpecchio,who is admired and respected by everyone in the area. Desperate in finding any way to grab Sonny's attention,Calogero decides to show that he can be trusted,by lying to the police over witnessing a shooting that LoSpecchio was involved in.Impressed by Anello's display of solidarity,Sonny decides to offer Calogero the chance to work at a near by bar that he owns.Before getting the chance to answer LoSpecchio's invitation,Calogero is gripped by his dad Lorenzo Anello,who tells his son that he does not want to see him around Sonny ever again.Sadly for Lorenzo,the temptation to be around his idol every day is something that Calogero finds impossible to resist. View on the film: Placed right in the middle of the mean streets of The Bronx,Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, (who sadly ruined everything that he showed here by being involved in a robbery that led to the death of a police officer,and also caused Brancato to be sent to jail for 10 years) each give brilliant performances as the 9 and 17 year old versions of Calogero Anello,with Brancato expanding on the awe that Calogero is caught in when he sees Sonny for the first time,by slowly revealing the pedestal that Calogero puts LoSpecchio on now forms the centre of his entire life. Revealing an unexpected melancholy,and backed by an excellent Do-Wop heavy soundtrack,debuting director/co-star Robert De Nero shows an impressive amount of restrain with the violence in the movie,which helps De Nero to give the film a terrific rites of passage,Autumn atmosphere,as Calogero has to decide if he wants to be flawed and human like his dad, (played with a real blue collar-ness by De Nero) or if he wants to be like the near mythical person he has created in LoSpecchio. Whilst the melancholy mood does allow De Nero to create a near mythical atmosphere,it also leads to some of the more "challenging" issues that the movie looks at, (such as racism) to feel just a little bit too glossy and neatly wrapped up. Getting the chance to put his autobiographical one man play onto the big screen,writer/co-star Chazz Palminteri shows that he has not lost any of his focus or passion in the transferring of medium,of his amazing story,with Palminteri's smart screenplay keeping everything at a very low,earthy level which helps to create a real intimacy and strong,natural bond between each of the contrasting characters,as Chazz also gives a very charismatic performance as LoSpecchio,who is shown to be keep his real self hidden in a gangster's shell,which leads to to Palminteri and De Nero being excellent guides,who allow the viewer to feel the full,clever wrap around sting beginning and ending,of this sharp Bronx tail.

    It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.

    "A Bronx Tale" appears on neo-noir lists, which is why I watched it. I was amazed to find out that it's a terrific morality and coming-of-age story, which is the opposite of a neo-noir. This movie has no bad notes and all kinds of good notes. De Niro's son is seen at two different ages, and the actors look alike and look like De Niro and his wife. Neither young actor upstaged the other. Certainly great credit has to go to writer Palminteri and director De Niro. The main message of the story is to find and develop one's unique talents. In other words, find your calling. After seeing it, I began to ponder the callings of people close to me. The story revolves around a bus driver's son who finds a mentor in the local gang boss. At both ages, the boy must struggle with becoming his own man, making moral choices and also dealing with the pressures from his close friends in the neighborhood. He must also deal with ethnic and racial frictions. This all produces a natural suspense that holds to the very last frame. "A Bronx Tale" is a gem.

The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader "well, now you can't leave"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the "don't mess with me mob mentality". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd. This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century.

    This was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut. I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11

    Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life. Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome "Hell's Angels" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl. Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings. No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.

    Searching around my local CEX store for any movies that had come out in 1993 which I could watch for a best of 1993 poll being held on the Classic Film board,I was pleased to find the DVD to a movie that Robert De Nero had made with Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking a look online,I was initially disappointed to discover that I had actually picked up a completely different film to the one that I had presumed it to be!, (with the Dicaprio and De Nero 1993 title being This Boy's Life) but with having really enjoyed last seeing Chazz Palminteri (who along with writing and co-starring in the movie,also wrote and acted in the play to which it is based on) in the classic Neo-Noir The Usual Suspects,I decided to make the most of my mistake,and got ready to see Palminteri and De Nero bring The Bronx to life. The plot: 1960: Finding his dads blue collar job of being a bus driver to lack the bright lights that he dreams of, 9 year old Calogero Anello sits on the steps outside the families block of flats and admires the sharp suit wearing guys who "control" The Bronx,with Anello being in complete awe of the gangs leader: Sonny LoSpecchio,who is admired and respected by everyone in the area. Desperate in finding any way to grab Sonny's attention,Calogero decides to show that he can be trusted,by lying to the police over witnessing a shooting that LoSpecchio was involved in.Impressed by Anello's display of solidarity,Sonny decides to offer Calogero the chance to work at a near by bar that he owns.Before getting the chance to answer LoSpecchio's invitation,Calogero is gripped by his dad Lorenzo Anello,who tells his son that he does not want to see him around Sonny ever again.Sadly for Lorenzo,the temptation to be around his idol every day is something that Calogero finds impossible to resist. View on the film: Placed right in the middle of the mean streets of The Bronx,Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, (who sadly ruined everything that he showed here by being involved in a robbery that led to the death of a police officer,and also caused Brancato to be sent to jail for 10 years) each give brilliant performances as the 9 and 17 year old versions of Calogero Anello,with Brancato expanding on the awe that Calogero is caught in when he sees Sonny for the first time,by slowly revealing the pedestal that Calogero puts LoSpecchio on now forms the centre of his entire life. Revealing an unexpected melancholy,and backed by an excellent Do-Wop heavy soundtrack,debuting director/co-star Robert De Nero shows an impressive amount of restrain with the violence in the movie,which helps De Nero to give the film a terrific rites of passage,Autumn atmosphere,as Calogero has to decide if he wants to be flawed and human like his dad, (played with a real blue collar-ness by De Nero) or if he wants to be like the near mythical person he has created in LoSpecchio. Whilst the melancholy mood does allow De Nero to create a near mythical atmosphere,it also leads to some of the more "challenging" issues that the movie looks at, (such as racism) to feel just a little bit too glossy and neatly wrapped up. Getting the chance to put his autobiographical one man play onto the big screen,writer/co-star Chazz Palminteri shows that he has not lost any of his focus or passion in the transferring of medium,of his amazing story,with Palminteri's smart screenplay keeping everything at a very low,earthy level which helps to create a real intimacy and strong,natural bond between each of the contrasting characters,as Chazz also gives a very charismatic performance as LoSpecchio,who is shown to be keep his real self hidden in a gangster's shell,which leads to to Palminteri and De Nero being excellent guides,who allow the viewer to feel the full,clever wrap around sting beginning and ending,of this sharp Bronx tail.

    It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.

    "A Bronx Tale" appears on neo-noir lists, which is why I watched it. I was amazed to find out that it's a terrific morality and coming-of-age story, which is the opposite of a neo-noir. This movie has no bad notes and all kinds of good notes. De Niro's son is seen at two different ages, and the actors look alike and look like De Niro and his wife. Neither young actor upstaged the other. Certainly great credit has to go to writer Palminteri and director De Niro. The main message of the story is to find and develop one's unique talents. In other words, find your calling. After seeing it, I began to ponder the callings of people close to me. The story revolves around a bus driver's son who finds a mentor in the local gang boss. At both ages, the boy must struggle with becoming his own man, making moral choices and also dealing with the pressures from his close friends in the neighborhood. He must also deal with ethnic and racial frictions. This all produces a natural suspense that holds to the very last frame. "A Bronx Tale" is a gem.

    We've been down this road before: impressionable young man from modest means in the 1960s is attracted to the flashy gangsters in his hometown; his father disapproves. Collaborative effort from producer-director-star Robert De Niro and screenwriter and co-star Chazz Palminteri (adapting his own play) could very well strike some as twee were it not for some well-played scenes in the beginning and a heartfelt conclusion. De Niro, making his debut behind the camera, works well mainly with the younger players--which is surprising--however his performance as a family man and bus driver is curiously muted and tentative. Palminteri seems encouraged to play to the rafters; while the actor strikes a charismatic presence, and is effective much of the time, less of him is more. Nostalgic trimmings help, though the period flavor is ultimately haphazardly captured. **1/2 from ****

    For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.
