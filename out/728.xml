 <sinopse>
  As part of a fertility research project, a male scientist agrees to carry a pregnancy in his own body.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Alex Hesse and Larry Arbogast are working on a new drug which will reduce the chances of a woman's body rejecting an embryo and thus causing a miscarriage. When their research funding is withdrawn, and human experimentation is denied to them, they decide to test the drug by breifly impregnating Hesse. Hesse however becomes attached to "his" unborn baby.

    Built on a bedrock of hard science and a sound what if? premise, Ivan Reitman's thoughtful film is... Oh, all right, 'Junior' is high concept nonsense, but it's somehow better than I expected it to be. A surprisingly decent (honest) Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scientist (stay with me here) who, along with partner Danny DeVito (it's only a film) has developed a drug to prevent miscarriages. With you so far, movie. But their funding is cut and Arnie has no choice but to test the drug on himself - by getting pregnant. So that's the premise, then. Nothing truly unexpected happens and Emma Thompson is annoying but it's all fairly enjoyable for some reason. I can't quite figure it out.

    Alex Hesse and Larry Arbogast are working on a new drug which will reduce the chances of a woman's body rejecting an embryo and causing a miscarriage. When their funding is withdrawn, and human experimentation is denied to them, they decide to test the drug by briefly impregnating Hesse. Hesse however becomes attached to his unborn baby. A high concept idea 'Arnie gets pregnant', let's reunite him with Devito, and we have another Twins on our hands.... But without a decent script and jokes, you don't and unfortunately the script is dire, and the novelty of Arnie being pregnant wears off, when you realise he does nothing but act camp for three quarters of the film. It was such a good idea though, and Reitman can do this sort of comedy in his sleep, but the magic just isn't there, and after the blow of Last Action Hero, Arnie must have thought he would be back as the king of the movies. How wrong everybody was. Thompson and Devito escape unscathed, but only just. A horrid waste of talent.

    Errr...OK where to start with this one? Arnold Schwartzenegger is a scientist who wants to test a pregnancy drug for women but doesn't get permission to do it. Instead, he and Danny DeVito come up with the utterly deranged idea to decide to test it on a man, that being Schwartzenegger obviously. After starting the experiment somehow, Arnold eventually abandons the testing in exchange for keeping the baby, acting like a sensitive woman, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. This film is terrible. It's your basic 1990s big-tough-guy-tapping-into-his-feminine-side awful comedy like 'Mr Nanny' I suppose (lessons which have NOT been beneficial to men OR women, but that's another story). There is some cheesy feminist rhetoric as to 'my body my choice' and 'you should try being a woman, it's a nightmare' (which in and of itself makes no logical sense), and none of it is remotely funny. I suppose the problem is that now that male sensitivity is mainstream to a somewhat crippling level, this film fails to be funny anymore. It just looks dated. The science which propels this horrifying idea forward is broken - how the hell does Arnold even grow a baby, having no womb? For me, I'd rather commit seppuku than watch this god-awful pile of horse manure again.

    As 'ridiculous' as the concept is, ignoring all the scientific inaccuracies, 'Junior' is a lot of fun. What would happen if men could carry babies in their 'womb'? Well you might want to try 'Junior'. Obviously the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously and that's how director Ivan Reitman treats this. Hats off to Schwarzenneger, who had established himself as the action hero, for taking up the challenge. He does a great job. His abilities in comedy have been underrated and 'Junior' just gave him that right kind of boost. And when you have people like Danny Devito, Emma Thompson and Pamela Reed then you can certainly expect to laugh. Thompson's comic flair also remains underrated and she is hilarious here without having to resort to the formulaic comedic tactics. In terms of writing, there are many funny dialogues that allow the scenes tickle. Even the more 'intense' sequences are loaded with funny dialogue (for example the sequence where Alex confronts Diana about Junior). 'Junior' is a movie that once can easily enjoy with the family. It was fun to revisit after years.

    I'm sure that any physician who has seen this movie is laughing at this movie, not because of the comedy but because of the medical part. The idea of this movie is fine but I dislike the fact that they 'just find' a got spot in a man's tummy to put a embryo, there's no medical explanation what so ever, like how does the baby gets the nourishment and so on. I laughed so much when I got to see Arnold behaving like a very sensitive and pregnant woman, this was probably the best thing about this movie. There are some fun scenes if you look away from the scientific part and this movie would be far worse if it didn't include these actors.

    In summing up, this movie is good but it isn't great. It does have its faults, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Starting with its problems, the film is a little too long, Pamela Reed is very underused which is a shame as I like her a lot as an actress and comedienne and there are one or two predictable parts. On the plus side, it is very well made with great cinematography and scenery, and the music is very nice. The pacing and direction are both very slick, and while Junior is basically very one-joke, there were some funny moments and the script does well to convey this. The acting is what drove Junior though, as well as the great if rather ridiculous concept. Arnold Schwarznegger is surprisingly entertaining here in one of his more lighter roles, while Danny DeVito is even better and Emma Thompson is absolutely gorgeous as the clumsy scientist and love interest(though I will say as a fan of hers she has given better performances). Overall, I liked it, it wasn't great but it wasn't awful either. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    In case you have not seen the movie, the story line of Junior (1994)is about a pregnant man. Of all of the men to select, Schwartenegger is the last actor I would have imagined in the role, which makes the movie all the more funny to watch. I always like the pairing of Schwartenegger and Devito. However, I found Schwartenegger and Thompson an unlikely pairing. Their humorous romance had hints of screwball comedy. This movie had me chuckling and laughing out loud. The premise is highly unlikely (at least at the time) but the movie makers made it seem almost plausible. This movie has some genuinely tender moments in the midst of the zaniness.

    You know, I can imagine Reitman looking at Twins, and thinking: "Hey, that worked out pretty well... the two of them are good together... I'll try that again". So he did. Only this time, while Danny is sleazy as ever(don't get me wrong, I've liked him in several roles, but it is kinda his shtick), and Arnie is, well, that physique doesn't just get put away for a movie or two, obviously, they're both playing competent doctors, and that's not where the high requirements for suspension of disbelief end with this thing(frankly, it's barely where they begin). Minimal effort is made to address the immediately obvious issues that there are with the concept of this, so it ends up being little else than a two-hour "pregnant woman behaviour" joke, mostly with Schwarzenegger acting that out, which is automatically hilarious, you know, because... he's a man! Get it? Don't worry about it. Oh, and there is "humor" from Thompson being clumsy, and occasionally frazzled, because she's a female nerd. Isn't it funny how, in Hollywood, all geeks of the fairer sex are either perfectly beautiful, or, you know, "television ugly", meaning, basically a pretty girl, just with unflattering clothes, glasses and/or bad hair? It's not a poorly done flick. It's shot, edited and scored just fine. Pacing is reasonable. The plot develops nicely, though it is entirely predictable. The romance and the attempts at getting emotional responses from the audience are largely unconvincing. I recommend this to those who wish to watch all the work of one or more of the people who made this. 5/10

    What a strange silly film. 1994 was not a great year I guess for Hollywood and for Schwarzenegger. Apart from being absurd, the humor there may have been between some of the frames and shots has disappeared. The film still survives as some kind of entertaining slow motion mental disposal animated and agitated void and empty discourse on the taste of the cosmic wind on the other side of the moon. But if you want to taste the slightly nostalgic vision of San Francisco and its cable cars be my guest and enjoy the trip.

    As 'ridiculous' as the concept is, ignoring all the scientific inaccuracies, 'Junior' is a lot of fun. What would happen if men could carry babies in their 'womb'? Well you might want to try 'Junior'. Obviously the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously and that's how director Ivan Reitman treats this. Hats off to Schwarzenneger, who had established himself as the action hero, for taking up the challenge. He does a great job. His abilities in comedy have been underrated and 'Junior' just gave him that right kind of boost. And when you have people like Danny Devito, Emma Thompson and Pamela Reed then you can certainly expect to laugh. Thompson's comic flair also remains underrated and she is hilarious here without having to resort to the formulaic comedic tactics. In terms of writing, there are many funny dialogues that allow the scenes tickle. Even the more 'intense' sequences are loaded with funny dialogue (for example the sequence where Alex confronts Diana about Junior). 'Junior' is a movie that once can easily enjoy with the family. It was fun to revisit after years.

    I'm sure that any physician who has seen this movie is laughing at this movie, not because of the comedy but because of the medical part. The idea of this movie is fine but I dislike the fact that they 'just find' a got spot in a man's tummy to put a embryo, there's no medical explanation what so ever, like how does the baby gets the nourishment and so on. I laughed so much when I got to see Arnold behaving like a very sensitive and pregnant woman, this was probably the best thing about this movie. There are some fun scenes if you look away from the scientific part and this movie would be far worse if it didn't include these actors.

    In summing up, this movie is good but it isn't great. It does have its faults, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Starting with its problems, the film is a little too long, Pamela Reed is very underused which is a shame as I like her a lot as an actress and comedienne and there are one or two predictable parts. On the plus side, it is very well made with great cinematography and scenery, and the music is very nice. The pacing and direction are both very slick, and while Junior is basically very one-joke, there were some funny moments and the script does well to convey this. The acting is what drove Junior though, as well as the great if rather ridiculous concept. Arnold Schwarznegger is surprisingly entertaining here in one of his more lighter roles, while Danny DeVito is even better and Emma Thompson is absolutely gorgeous as the clumsy scientist and love interest(though I will say as a fan of hers she has given better performances). Overall, I liked it, it wasn't great but it wasn't awful either. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    In case you have not seen the movie, the story line of Junior (1994)is about a pregnant man. Of all of the men to select, Schwartenegger is the last actor I would have imagined in the role, which makes the movie all the more funny to watch. I always like the pairing of Schwartenegger and Devito. However, I found Schwartenegger and Thompson an unlikely pairing. Their humorous romance had hints of screwball comedy. This movie had me chuckling and laughing out loud. The premise is highly unlikely (at least at the time) but the movie makers made it seem almost plausible. This movie has some genuinely tender moments in the midst of the zaniness.

    You know, I can imagine Reitman looking at Twins, and thinking: "Hey, that worked out pretty well... the two of them are good together... I'll try that again". So he did. Only this time, while Danny is sleazy as ever(don't get me wrong, I've liked him in several roles, but it is kinda his shtick), and Arnie is, well, that physique doesn't just get put away for a movie or two, obviously, they're both playing competent doctors, and that's not where the high requirements for suspension of disbelief end with this thing(frankly, it's barely where they begin). Minimal effort is made to address the immediately obvious issues that there are with the concept of this, so it ends up being little else than a two-hour "pregnant woman behaviour" joke, mostly with Schwarzenegger acting that out, which is automatically hilarious, you know, because... he's a man! Get it? Don't worry about it. Oh, and there is "humor" from Thompson being clumsy, and occasionally frazzled, because she's a female nerd. Isn't it funny how, in Hollywood, all geeks of the fairer sex are either perfectly beautiful, or, you know, "television ugly", meaning, basically a pretty girl, just with unflattering clothes, glasses and/or bad hair? It's not a poorly done flick. It's shot, edited and scored just fine. Pacing is reasonable. The plot develops nicely, though it is entirely predictable. The romance and the attempts at getting emotional responses from the audience are largely unconvincing. I recommend this to those who wish to watch all the work of one or more of the people who made this. 5/10

    What a strange silly film. 1994 was not a great year I guess for Hollywood and for Schwarzenegger. Apart from being absurd, the humor there may have been between some of the frames and shots has disappeared. The film still survives as some kind of entertaining slow motion mental disposal animated and agitated void and empty discourse on the taste of the cosmic wind on the other side of the moon. But if you want to taste the slightly nostalgic vision of San Francisco and its cable cars be my guest and enjoy the trip.

    Built on a bedrock of hard science and a sound what if? premise, Ivan Reitman's thoughtful film is... Oh, all right, 'Junior' is high concept nonsense, but it's somehow better than I expected it to be. A surprisingly decent (honest) Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scientist (stay with me here) who, along with partner Danny DeVito (it's only a film) has developed a drug to prevent miscarriages. With you so far, movie. But their funding is cut and Arnie has no choice but to test the drug on himself - by getting pregnant. So that's the premise, then. Nothing truly unexpected happens and Emma Thompson is annoying but it's all fairly enjoyable for some reason. I can't quite figure it out.

    Alex Hesse and Larry Arbogast are working on a new drug which will reduce the chances of a woman's body rejecting an embryo and causing a miscarriage. When their funding is withdrawn, and human experimentation is denied to them, they decide to test the drug by briefly impregnating Hesse. Hesse however becomes attached to his unborn baby. A high concept idea 'Arnie gets pregnant', let's reunite him with Devito, and we have another Twins on our hands.... But without a decent script and jokes, you don't and unfortunately the script is dire, and the novelty of Arnie being pregnant wears off, when you realise he does nothing but act camp for three quarters of the film. It was such a good idea though, and Reitman can do this sort of comedy in his sleep, but the magic just isn't there, and after the blow of Last Action Hero, Arnie must have thought he would be back as the king of the movies. How wrong everybody was. Thompson and Devito escape unscathed, but only just. A horrid waste of talent.

    Errr...OK where to start with this one? Arnold Schwartzenegger is a scientist who wants to test a pregnancy drug for women but doesn't get permission to do it. Instead, he and Danny DeVito come up with the utterly deranged idea to decide to test it on a man, that being Schwartzenegger obviously. After starting the experiment somehow, Arnold eventually abandons the testing in exchange for keeping the baby, acting like a sensitive woman, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. This film is terrible. It's your basic 1990s big-tough-guy-tapping-into-his-feminine-side awful comedy like 'Mr Nanny' I suppose (lessons which have NOT been beneficial to men OR women, but that's another story). There is some cheesy feminist rhetoric as to 'my body my choice' and 'you should try being a woman, it's a nightmare' (which in and of itself makes no logical sense), and none of it is remotely funny. I suppose the problem is that now that male sensitivity is mainstream to a somewhat crippling level, this film fails to be funny anymore. It just looks dated. The science which propels this horrifying idea forward is broken - how the hell does Arnold even grow a baby, having no womb? For me, I'd rather commit seppuku than watch this god-awful pile of horse manure again.

Only this time, while Danny is sleazy as ever(don't get me wrong, I've liked him in several roles, but it is kinda his shtick), and Arnie is, well, that physique doesn't just get put away for a movie or two, obviously, they're both playing competent doctors, and that's not where the high requirements for suspension of disbelief end with this thing(frankly, it's barely where they begin). Minimal effort is made to address the immediately obvious issues that there are with the concept of this, so it ends up being little else than a two-hour "pregnant woman behaviour" joke, mostly with Schwarzenegger acting that out, which is automatically hilarious, you know, because... he's a man! Get it? Don't worry about it. Oh, and there is "humor" from Thompson being clumsy, and occasionally frazzled, because she's a female nerd. Isn't it funny how, in Hollywood, all geeks of the fairer sex are either perfectly beautiful, or, you know, "television ugly", meaning, basically a pretty girl, just with unflattering clothes, glasses and/or bad hair? It's not a poorly done flick. It's shot, edited and scored just fine. Pacing is reasonable. The plot develops nicely, though it is entirely predictable. The romance and the attempts at getting emotional responses from the audience are largely unconvincing. I recommend this to those who wish to watch all the work of one or more of the people who made this. 5/10

    What a strange silly film. 1994 was not a great year I guess for Hollywood and for Schwarzenegger. Apart from being absurd, the humor there may have been between some of the frames and shots has disappeared. The film still survives as some kind of entertaining slow motion mental disposal animated and agitated void and empty discourse on the taste of the cosmic wind on the other side of the moon. But if you want to taste the slightly nostalgic vision of San Francisco and its cable cars be my guest and enjoy the trip.

    Built on a bedrock of hard science and a sound what if? premise, Ivan Reitman's thoughtful film is... Oh, all right, 'Junior' is high concept nonsense, but it's somehow better than I expected it to be. A surprisingly decent (honest) Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scientist (stay with me here) who, along with partner Danny DeVito (it's only a film) has developed a drug to prevent miscarriages. With you so far, movie. But their funding is cut and Arnie has no choice but to test the drug on himself - by getting pregnant. So that's the premise, then. Nothing truly unexpected happens and Emma Thompson is annoying but it's all fairly enjoyable for some reason. I can't quite figure it out.

    Alex Hesse and Larry Arbogast are working on a new drug which will reduce the chances of a woman's body rejecting an embryo and causing a miscarriage. When their funding is withdrawn, and human experimentation is denied to them, they decide to test the drug by briefly impregnating Hesse. Hesse however becomes attached to his unborn baby. A high concept idea 'Arnie gets pregnant', let's reunite him with Devito, and we have another Twins on our hands.... But without a decent script and jokes, you don't and unfortunately the script is dire, and the novelty of Arnie being pregnant wears off, when you realise he does nothing but act camp for three quarters of the film. It was such a good idea though, and Reitman can do this sort of comedy in his sleep, but the magic just isn't there, and after the blow of Last Action Hero, Arnie must have thought he would be back as the king of the movies. How wrong everybody was. Thompson and Devito escape unscathed, but only just. A horrid waste of talent.

    Errr...OK where to start with this one? Arnold Schwartzenegger is a scientist who wants to test a pregnancy drug for women but doesn't get permission to do it. Instead, he and Danny DeVito come up with the utterly deranged idea to decide to test it on a man, that being Schwartzenegger obviously. After starting the experiment somehow, Arnold eventually abandons the testing in exchange for keeping the baby, acting like a sensitive woman, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. This film is terrible. It's your basic 1990s big-tough-guy-tapping-into-his-feminine-side awful comedy like 'Mr Nanny' I suppose (lessons which have NOT been beneficial to men OR women, but that's another story). There is some cheesy feminist rhetoric as to 'my body my choice' and 'you should try being a woman, it's a nightmare' (which in and of itself makes no logical sense), and none of it is remotely funny. I suppose the problem is that now that male sensitivity is mainstream to a somewhat crippling level, this film fails to be funny anymore. It just looks dated. The science which propels this horrifying idea forward is broken - how the hell does Arnold even grow a baby, having no womb? For me, I'd rather commit seppuku than watch this god-awful pile of horse manure again.

    As 'ridiculous' as the concept is, ignoring all the scientific inaccuracies, 'Junior' is a lot of fun. What would happen if men could carry babies in their 'womb'? Well you might want to try 'Junior'. Obviously the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously and that's how director Ivan Reitman treats this. Hats off to Schwarzenneger, who had established himself as the action hero, for taking up the challenge. He does a great job. His abilities in comedy have been underrated and 'Junior' just gave him that right kind of boost. And when you have people like Danny Devito, Emma Thompson and Pamela Reed then you can certainly expect to laugh. Thompson's comic flair also remains underrated and she is hilarious here without having to resort to the formulaic comedic tactics. In terms of writing, there are many funny dialogues that allow the scenes tickle. Even the more 'intense' sequences are loaded with funny dialogue (for example the sequence where Alex confronts Diana about Junior). 'Junior' is a movie that once can easily enjoy with the family. It was fun to revisit after years.

    I'm sure that any physician who has seen this movie is laughing at this movie, not because of the comedy but because of the medical part. The idea of this movie is fine but I dislike the fact that they 'just find' a got spot in a man's tummy to put a embryo, there's no medical explanation what so ever, like how does the baby gets the nourishment and so on. I laughed so much when I got to see Arnold behaving like a very sensitive and pregnant woman, this was probably the best thing about this movie. There are some fun scenes if you look away from the scientific part and this movie would be far worse if it didn't include these actors.

    In summing up, this movie is good but it isn't great. It does have its faults, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Starting with its problems, the film is a little too long, Pamela Reed is very underused which is a shame as I like her a lot as an actress and comedienne and there are one or two predictable parts. On the plus side, it is very well made with great cinematography and scenery, and the music is very nice. The pacing and direction are both very slick, and while Junior is basically very one-joke, there were some funny moments and the script does well to convey this. The acting is what drove Junior though, as well as the great if rather ridiculous concept. Arnold Schwarznegger is surprisingly entertaining here in one of his more lighter roles, while Danny DeVito is even better and Emma Thompson is absolutely gorgeous as the clumsy scientist and love interest(though I will say as a fan of hers she has given better performances). Overall, I liked it, it wasn't great but it wasn't awful either. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    In case you have not seen the movie, the story line of Junior (1994)is about a pregnant man. Of all of the men to select, Schwartenegger is the last actor I would have imagined in the role, which makes the movie all the more funny to watch. I always like the pairing of Schwartenegger and Devito. However, I found Schwartenegger and Thompson an unlikely pairing. Their humorous romance had hints of screwball comedy. This movie had me chuckling and laughing out loud. The premise is highly unlikely (at least at the time) but the movie makers made it seem almost plausible. This movie has some genuinely tender moments in the midst of the zaniness.
