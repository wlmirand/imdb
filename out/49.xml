 <sinopse>
  Albert Einstein helps a young man who's in love with Einstein's niece to catch her attention by pretending temporarily to be a great physicist.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Edward Walters, an auto mechanic, falls for the intelligent and beautiful Catherine Boyd. It is love at first sight. There is however a problem, she's engaged to jerk James Moreland. Fortunately, Catherine's uncle likes Ed, and with his friends they scheme to make Catherine fall for Ed. The comedy in this movie stems from the fact that Catherine's uncle is none other than Albert Einstein, who's portrayed as a fun loving genius, as are his mischievous colleagues, Nathan, Kurt and Boris.

    I originally associated Fred Schepisi with true-life crime dramas like "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" and "A Cry in the Dark", both set in his native Australia, but he is clearly a versatile director who has also turned his hand to comedy. "I.Q." has a lot in common with&nbsp;"Roxanne", probably Schepisi's best-known comic movie made several years earlier. Both films are romantic comedies based upon a love- triangle with two men in love with the same woman. In both films the woman is a highly-educated intellectual, and in both one of the men tries to impress her by pretending to be more intelligent or more educated&nbsp;than he really is. In "Roxanne" the woman is an astronomer; here she is a mathematician, but we learn that her father was an astronomer and the appearance of comet plays an important role in both films. The action takes place in New Jersey in the 1950s. If you want to be precise, both Dwight D. Eisenhower (as&nbsp;President) and&nbsp;Albert Einstein appear as characters, so the action must take place between Ike's inauguration in January 1953 and Einstein's death in April 1955, but as the film takes a number of liberties with historical fact that sort of precision is not really necessary. (For example, Einstein is seen listening to&nbsp;Little Richard's&nbsp;"Tutti-Frutti," which was not released until after his death). The heroine is Catherine Boyd, Albert Einstein's (fictional) niece, who has obviously inherited her famous uncle's brains as she is a brilliant&nbsp;mathematics student at Princeton University. Her two admirers are Ed Walters, a garage mechanic, and her British fianc&eacute; James Moreland, a university lecturer in experimental psychology. As is normal in two-boys-in-love-with-one-girl type rom-coms, the two have very different personalities. Although Ed has good general intelligence he has little formal education, but is amiable and caring. James is academically brilliant but a pompous stuffed shirt who treats Catherine with&nbsp;patronising condescension, believing that her main function in life will be as mother to the brilliant children to be fathered by&nbsp;himself. Catherine's uncle Albert realises that James, for all his academic prowess, is a complete prat, so tries to persuade her that Ed would be much better suited to her. To this end he and three friends, the scientists and mathematicians Nathan Liebknecht, Kurt G&ouml;del and&nbsp;Boris Podolsky, come up with a scheme to convince Catherine (and the world) that Ed is a scientific genius. The weak link as far as the acting was concerned was, in my view, Tim Robbins as Ed; l felt that the role needed someone more relaxed, less serious and younger. (The age difference between Robbins and Meg Ryan is only three years, but here it seems much greater). According to Schepisi, Robbins was unhappy with the way his character was written, feeling that nobody would like a man "who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie", and it seems as if some of this uneasiness comes across in his performance. (There is a difference in this respect between "IQ" and "Roxanne", where it is the unsympathetic, and ultimately unsuccessful, suitor, who pretends to a level of education which he does not possess). Ryan herself, however, makes a sweet and appealing heroine. In the nineties she (along with Julia Roberts) was Hollywood's official Queen of Romantic Comedy and here she achieves the feat (as did Daryl Hannah in "Roxanne") of playing a woman who is not only attractive but also educated and intelligent without resorting to that old "bespectacled bluestocking" clich&eacute;.&nbsp; Walter Matthau was one of those actors who never seemed to retire, or even to fade away, but carried on taking leading roles in major feature films throughout the eighth, and final, decade of his life. Perhaps his best-known role from this period was in "Grumpy Old Men", but his Albert Einstein, portrayed as loveably mischievous, kindly and fun-loving, is far from being a grumpy old man. His three colleagues are all played in much the same way, and as being around the same age as Einstein, although historically this is not accurate. (Kurt G&ouml;del, for example, would only have been in his forties at the time the film is set; Lou Jacobi, who plays him here, was 81 when the film was made). I wouldn't rate&nbsp;"IQ" quite as highly as&nbsp;"Roxanne", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties, although with a stronger male lead it might have fall into the same category. Steve Martin, the male lead in "Roxanne", is one of that film's great strengths, much better than Tim Robbins is here, although on the feminine side Meg Ryan is just as good as Daryl Hannah. Overall, however, "IQ" is a highly enjoyable comedy, warm and human with its central theme that life is as much about the heart as about the mind. 7/10

    I.Q was the Big Bang Theory of the 1990's. This romantic comedy directed by Fred Schepisi is a very charming film. The film is about friendly garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) who is trying to impress a smart Princeton University mathematician, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) by acting a newly discovery genius with some help with Catherine's Uncle, Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) and his buddies, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt G&ouml;del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks). The casting for Albert Einstein's friends almost were originally going to be Peter Ustinov, Barry Humphries and John Cleese. No matter who was cast, they see Edward as someone who would be better suited for Catherine, rather than her stiff and fussy English fianc&eacute;, experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). Things get heat up, when the science community heard about this 'wunderkind' genius work on Cold Fusion power rockets, and seek Edward to help the American take back, the space race from the Russians. I have to say, everybody is just charming. Tim Robbins is a fine actor who is believable, but he was a bit difficult during filming I heard. He said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. In my opinion, I didn't mind it, but I think Tim Robbins was right, because not a lot of people end up going to see this movie. Meg Ryan is a hot smart woman who looks wonderful in the poodle skirts. She looks really young in this role. Stephen Fry was pretty good, and at less, the filmmakers didn't make his character too unlikable. Last, I have to say Walter Matthau fit the part. He did a great job to the point that it seem like Albert Einstein was playing himself. For dramatic reasons, I.Q. fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt G&ouml;del was famously shy and reclusive, so he probably wouldn't be hanging out with Einstein and Boris Podolsky. I like how the movie didn't play it safe, by over explaining the calculations of the physics theories. If you don't get the jokes. It's alright. I didn't get some of the things, they were saying, too. Plus, I study physics before, coming into this film. I love to do my research, and I think I learn a lot from this film. I never heard of Hamiltonians, iambic pentameter, zeno paradox and others. The odd humor might leave some people scratching their heads, but overall, most of it was pretty simple to understand. The comedy works as well. I love the debate scene about if time exist or not. The whole I.Q test was funny, but a bit unrealistic. The Spike Jones music scene was pretty odd. The Marlon Brando impression was great. By the way, people, the impression was from 1953's Wild Ones and 1954's On the Waterfront, not 1972's the Godfather. I love the movie soundtrack very much from Jerry Goldsmith. The violin melody of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star was amazing to hear. Other songs heard was the Alphabet song, and some classical music from Wolfgang Mozart, and Joseph Haydn. Some critics didn't find the movie great, because Einstein in their eyes seem too silly or dumb. I doubt Einstein was such a hard head scientist. Einstein reportedly was playful and fond of jokes that could be seen by some as childish, but in the movie, he was indeed sound smart with all the terminology. I love how they got away with the PG rating with all the sexual innuendos, down speaks, and euphemism. There was a lot of dark humor as well like example, the man stuck in a box without a sense of time. Minus, the historic accuracies, this film is fun to watch. This romantic comedy is full of wahoo!

    IQ set back in the Fifties is a glorious story of young people in love in an optimistic age. Of course you have to be real optimistic if you think in any age that garage mechanic Tim Robbins is going to get Meg Ryan who is a mathematician. Furthermore she's engaged to a psychologist Stephen Fry who is one real drip as they would have said back in those days. Forgetting Robbins, you've got to wonder what Ryan could possibly see in Fry. Answer is intelligent, she's got the notion that if she marries a smart guy, she'll have smart kids. Believe me, that doesn't always work out. But when she stops at Tony Shalhoub's filling station and their eyes meet you know it's inevitable for Ryan and Robbins. They just need a matchmaker and who better than Uncle Albert. That's Uncle Albert Einstein that is who in his last years was the most distinguished member of the Princeton faculty. So what does Uncle Albert do, to bring Robbins up to her 'level' he has him expound a theory of 'nuclear fusion rocket fuel'. We'll have warp drive and way before Captain Kirk is doing his thing. And Robbins is a bright guy and has a lot of people going including those at the highest level. Walter Matthau plays Einstein and with his scene stealing abilities he dominates the film. Matthau has a set of other elderly professors who look a whole lot like that group writing the encyclopedia in Ball Of Fire. They aid and abet his deception. Someone did a bit of research on Einstein because he admits at the climax to being a poor mathematician. That was true in real life and it's a key point in resolving the whole affair. If you like romantic films and Walter Matthau than IQ is definitely the film for you.

    Normally I don't write reviews for movies that have been around awhile and/or have other good reviews (and there are many for this movie), but when I saw that the overall rating for this movie was a 6 I decided that I had to step in and record my vote as well as give it some props here. I.Q. is a treat. A nice, cute movie. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie ever made or that it will change your world, but it's a joy. Walter Matthau, as always, is great. Tim Robbins once again shows why any movie he's in is worth watching. (Well, maybe not The Hudsucker Proxy, but that's not his fault!!) And Meg Ryan simply glows. She has never looked or acted better. As with any good movie, the supporting cast also shines. There's some familiar faces like Lou Jacobi and some different faces. It is also a very nice looking movie. Maybe the Director coming from Australia is a factor as sometimes it takes an outsider to see the beauty of New Jersey!! And that Princeton part of Joisey is certainly beautiful. You'll enjoy yourself with this movie.

    A comedy of sorts, and yet a dream more than a real story. Why not? We have the right to dream, even about real life. A band of old German scientists who have found refuge in the US because they were Jewish, among whom Albert Einstein is the most prestigious, are enjoying the love that is nascent in Einstein's niece for a simple garage mechanic and they organize a prank to make him shine with the highest IQ possible, and since when you reach a certain level of intelligence nothing is impossible, those four men manage to make the young mathematician niece fall in love top over toes in all directions and she finally recognizes that love is probably more important in life than just mathematics and science and university and research. The rest is Jewish antics and humor about life and death, love and the unknowable, the mind, the spirit, the soul, the brain, or whatever is residing up there in the skull. Some say love is not always on time, and they are wrong because love is always on time for those who believe time does not exist, and they are numerous since time, you know, hours, minutes, seconds and weeks and months are nothing but a human intellectual construction on the basis of the experience of the duration of things that cannot be measured and is absolutely as regular as a clock that is speeding up going up and slowing down going down, or vice versa. And love is the compass that can keep you on the right road in the right direction towards the right destination that you may never reach because distance is like duration: it is unfathomable and infinite.

    This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it an 8!

    While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him). So anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.

    Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****

    Typically stupid modern American comedy. The language and sensibility are 1990s while using 1950s props and a mix of hair styles and clothes from whatever era. They should have left it in the 90s and made it Dr. Salk. Too bad because it is a good cast. Feels like it was written by teenagers. Two stars at best. It's really too bad because there are some scenes that begin quite cleverly and then fall very flat, not the actors fault really, it's just so poorly done. The movie tries desperately to be a throwback to some of the fun comedies made in the late 40s-early 50s...Monkey Business comes to mind, maybe even A Song is Born. All in all quite forgettable.

    I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fianc&eacute; (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun. The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the "RRRatman" and Ryan's fianc&eacute;; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body. The film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.

    IQ set back in the Fifties is a glorious story of young people in love in an optimistic age. Of course you have to be real optimistic if you think in any age that garage mechanic Tim Robbins is going to get Meg Ryan who is a mathematician. Furthermore she's engaged to a psychologist Stephen Fry who is one real drip as they would have said back in those days. Forgetting Robbins, you've got to wonder what Ryan could possibly see in Fry. Answer is intelligent, she's got the notion that if she marries a smart guy, she'll have smart kids. Believe me, that doesn't always work out. But when she stops at Tony Shalhoub's filling station and their eyes meet you know it's inevitable for Ryan and Robbins. They just need a matchmaker and who better than Uncle Albert. That's Uncle Albert Einstein that is who in his last years was the most distinguished member of the Princeton faculty. So what does Uncle Albert do, to bring Robbins up to her 'level' he has him expound a theory of 'nuclear fusion rocket fuel'. We'll have warp drive and way before Captain Kirk is doing his thing. And Robbins is a bright guy and has a lot of people going including those at the highest level. Walter Matthau plays Einstein and with his scene stealing abilities he dominates the film. Matthau has a set of other elderly professors who look a whole lot like that group writing the encyclopedia in Ball Of Fire. They aid and abet his deception. Someone did a bit of research on Einstein because he admits at the climax to being a poor mathematician. That was true in real life and it's a key point in resolving the whole affair. If you like romantic films and Walter Matthau than IQ is definitely the film for you.

    Normally I don't write reviews for movies that have been around awhile and/or have other good reviews (and there are many for this movie), but when I saw that the overall rating for this movie was a 6 I decided that I had to step in and record my vote as well as give it some props here. I.Q. is a treat. A nice, cute movie. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie ever made or that it will change your world, but it's a joy. Walter Matthau, as always, is great. Tim Robbins once again shows why any movie he's in is worth watching. (Well, maybe not The Hudsucker Proxy, but that's not his fault!!) And Meg Ryan simply glows. She has never looked or acted better. As with any good movie, the supporting cast also shines. There's some familiar faces like Lou Jacobi and some different faces. It is also a very nice looking movie. Maybe the Director coming from Australia is a factor as sometimes it takes an outsider to see the beauty of New Jersey!! And that Princeton part of Joisey is certainly beautiful. You'll enjoy yourself with this movie.

    A comedy of sorts, and yet a dream more than a real story. Why not? We have the right to dream, even about real life. A band of old German scientists who have found refuge in the US because they were Jewish, among whom Albert Einstein is the most prestigious, are enjoying the love that is nascent in Einstein's niece for a simple garage mechanic and they organize a prank to make him shine with the highest IQ possible, and since when you reach a certain level of intelligence nothing is impossible, those four men manage to make the young mathematician niece fall in love top over toes in all directions and she finally recognizes that love is probably more important in life than just mathematics and science and university and research. The rest is Jewish antics and humor about life and death, love and the unknowable, the mind, the spirit, the soul, the brain, or whatever is residing up there in the skull. Some say love is not always on time, and they are wrong because love is always on time for those who believe time does not exist, and they are numerous since time, you know, hours, minutes, seconds and weeks and months are nothing but a human intellectual construction on the basis of the experience of the duration of things that cannot be measured and is absolutely as regular as a clock that is speeding up going up and slowing down going down, or vice versa. And love is the compass that can keep you on the right road in the right direction towards the right destination that you may never reach because distance is like duration: it is unfathomable and infinite.

    This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it an 8!

    While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him). So anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.

    Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****

    Typically stupid modern American comedy. The language and sensibility are 1990s while using 1950s props and a mix of hair styles and clothes from whatever era. They should have left it in the 90s and made it Dr. Salk. Too bad because it is a good cast. Feels like it was written by teenagers. Two stars at best. It's really too bad because there are some scenes that begin quite cleverly and then fall very flat, not the actors fault really, it's just so poorly done. The movie tries desperately to be a throwback to some of the fun comedies made in the late 40s-early 50s...Monkey Business comes to mind, maybe even A Song is Born. All in all quite forgettable.

    I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fianc&eacute; (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun. The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the "RRRatman" and Ryan's fianc&eacute;; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body. The film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.

    I originally associated Fred Schepisi with true-life crime dramas like "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" and "A Cry in the Dark", both set in his native Australia, but he is clearly a versatile director who has also turned his hand to comedy. "I.Q." has a lot in common with&nbsp;"Roxanne", probably Schepisi's best-known comic movie made several years earlier. Both films are romantic comedies based upon a love- triangle with two men in love with the same woman. In both films the woman is a highly-educated intellectual, and in both one of the men tries to impress her by pretending to be more intelligent or more educated&nbsp;than he really is. In "Roxanne" the woman is an astronomer; here she is a mathematician, but we learn that her father was an astronomer and the appearance of comet plays an important role in both films. The action takes place in New Jersey in the 1950s. If you want to be precise, both Dwight D. Eisenhower (as&nbsp;President) and&nbsp;Albert Einstein appear as characters, so the action must take place between Ike's inauguration in January 1953 and Einstein's death in April 1955, but as the film takes a number of liberties with historical fact that sort of precision is not really necessary. (For example, Einstein is seen listening to&nbsp;Little Richard's&nbsp;"Tutti-Frutti," which was not released until after his death). The heroine is Catherine Boyd, Albert Einstein's (fictional) niece, who has obviously inherited her famous uncle's brains as she is a brilliant&nbsp;mathematics student at Princeton University. Her two admirers are Ed Walters, a garage mechanic, and her British fianc&eacute; James Moreland, a university lecturer in experimental psychology. As is normal in two-boys-in-love-with-one-girl type rom-coms, the two have very different personalities. Although Ed has good general intelligence he has little formal education, but is amiable and caring. James is academically brilliant but a pompous stuffed shirt who treats Catherine with&nbsp;patronising condescension, believing that her main function in life will be as mother to the brilliant children to be fathered by&nbsp;himself. Catherine's uncle Albert realises that James, for all his academic prowess, is a complete prat, so tries to persuade her that Ed would be much better suited to her. To this end he and three friends, the scientists and mathematicians Nathan Liebknecht, Kurt G&ouml;del and&nbsp;Boris Podolsky, come up with a scheme to convince Catherine (and the world) that Ed is a scientific genius. The weak link as far as the acting was concerned was, in my view, Tim Robbins as Ed; l felt that the role needed someone more relaxed, less serious and younger. (The age difference between Robbins and Meg Ryan is only three years, but here it seems much greater). According to Schepisi, Robbins was unhappy with the way his character was written, feeling that nobody would like a man "who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie", and it seems as if some of this uneasiness comes across in his performance. (There is a difference in this respect between "IQ" and "Roxanne", where it is the unsympathetic, and ultimately unsuccessful, suitor, who pretends to a level of education which he does not possess). Ryan herself, however, makes a sweet and appealing heroine. In the nineties she (along with Julia Roberts) was Hollywood's official Queen of Romantic Comedy and here she achieves the feat (as did Daryl Hannah in "Roxanne") of playing a woman who is not only attractive but also educated and intelligent without resorting to that old "bespectacled bluestocking" clich&eacute;.&nbsp; Walter Matthau was one of those actors who never seemed to retire, or even to fade away, but carried on taking leading roles in major feature films throughout the eighth, and final, decade of his life. Perhaps his best-known role from this period was in "Grumpy Old Men", but his Albert Einstein, portrayed as loveably mischievous, kindly and fun-loving, is far from being a grumpy old man. His three colleagues are all played in much the same way, and as being around the same age as Einstein, although historically this is not accurate. (Kurt G&ouml;del, for example, would only have been in his forties at the time the film is set; Lou Jacobi, who plays him here, was 81 when the film was made). I wouldn't rate&nbsp;"IQ" quite as highly as&nbsp;"Roxanne", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties, although with a stronger male lead it might have fall into the same category. Steve Martin, the male lead in "Roxanne", is one of that film's great strengths, much better than Tim Robbins is here, although on the feminine side Meg Ryan is just as good as Daryl Hannah. Overall, however, "IQ" is a highly enjoyable comedy, warm and human with its central theme that life is as much about the heart as about the mind. 7/10

    I.Q was the Big Bang Theory of the 1990's. This romantic comedy directed by Fred Schepisi is a very charming film. The film is about friendly garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) who is trying to impress a smart Princeton University mathematician, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) by acting a newly discovery genius with some help with Catherine's Uncle, Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) and his buddies, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt G&ouml;del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks). The casting for Albert Einstein's friends almost were originally going to be Peter Ustinov, Barry Humphries and John Cleese. No matter who was cast, they see Edward as someone who would be better suited for Catherine, rather than her stiff and fussy English fianc&eacute;, experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). Things get heat up, when the science community heard about this 'wunderkind' genius work on Cold Fusion power rockets, and seek Edward to help the American take back, the space race from the Russians. I have to say, everybody is just charming. Tim Robbins is a fine actor who is believable, but he was a bit difficult during filming I heard. He said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. In my opinion, I didn't mind it, but I think Tim Robbins was right, because not a lot of people end up going to see this movie. Meg Ryan is a hot smart woman who looks wonderful in the poodle skirts. She looks really young in this role. Stephen Fry was pretty good, and at less, the filmmakers didn't make his character too unlikable. Last, I have to say Walter Matthau fit the part. He did a great job to the point that it seem like Albert Einstein was playing himself. For dramatic reasons, I.Q. fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt G&ouml;del was famously shy and reclusive, so he probably wouldn't be hanging out with Einstein and Boris Podolsky. I like how the movie didn't play it safe, by over explaining the calculations of the physics theories. If you don't get the jokes. It's alright. I didn't get some of the things, they were saying, too. Plus, I study physics before, coming into this film. I love to do my research, and I think I learn a lot from this film. I never heard of Hamiltonians, iambic pentameter, zeno paradox and others. The odd humor might leave some people scratching their heads, but overall, most of it was pretty simple to understand. The comedy works as well. I love the debate scene about if time exist or not. The whole I.Q test was funny, but a bit unrealistic. The Spike Jones music scene was pretty odd. The Marlon Brando impression was great. By the way, people, the impression was from 1953's Wild Ones and 1954's On the Waterfront, not 1972's the Godfather. I love the movie soundtrack very much from Jerry Goldsmith. The violin melody of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star was amazing to hear. Other songs heard was the Alphabet song, and some classical music from Wolfgang Mozart, and Joseph Haydn. Some critics didn't find the movie great, because Einstein in their eyes seem too silly or dumb. I doubt Einstein was such a hard head scientist. Einstein reportedly was playful and fond of jokes that could be seen by some as childish, but in the movie, he was indeed sound smart with all the terminology. I love how they got away with the PG rating with all the sexual innuendos, down speaks, and euphemism. There was a lot of dark humor as well like example, the man stuck in a box without a sense of time. Minus, the historic accuracies, this film is fun to watch. This romantic comedy is full of wahoo!

    I originally associated Fred Schepisi with true-life crime dramas like "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" and "A Cry in the Dark", both set in his native Australia, but he is clearly a versatile director who has also turned his hand to comedy. "I.Q." has a lot in common with&nbsp;"Roxanne", probably Schepisi's best-known comic movie made several years earlier. Both films are romantic comedies based upon a love- triangle with two men in love with the same woman. In both films the woman is a highly-educated intellectual, and in both one of the men tries to impress her by pretending to be more intelligent or more educated&nbsp;than he really is. In "Roxanne" the woman is an astronomer; here she is a mathematician, but we learn that her father was an astronomer and the appearance of comet plays an important role in both films. The action takes place in New Jersey in the 1950s. If you want to be precise, both Dwight D. Eisenhower (as&nbsp;President) and&nbsp;Albert Einstein appear as characters, so the action must take place between Ike's inauguration in January 1953 and Einstein's death in April 1955, but as the film takes a number of liberties with historical fact that sort of precision is not really necessary. (For example, Einstein is seen listening to&nbsp;Little Richard's&nbsp;"Tutti-Frutti," which was not released until after his death). The heroine is Catherine Boyd, Albert Einstein's (fictional) niece, who has obviously inherited her famous uncle's brains as she is a brilliant&nbsp;mathematics student at Princeton University. Her two admirers are Ed Walters, a garage mechanic, and her British fianc&eacute; James Moreland, a university lecturer in experimental psychology. As is normal in two-boys-in-love-with-one-girl type rom-coms, the two have very different personalities. Although Ed has good general intelligence he has little formal education, but is amiable and caring. James is academically brilliant but a pompous stuffed shirt who treats Catherine with&nbsp;patronising condescension, believing that her main function in life will be as mother to the brilliant children to be fathered by&nbsp;himself. Catherine's uncle Albert realises that James, for all his academic prowess, is a complete prat, so tries to persuade her that Ed would be much better suited to her. To this end he and three friends, the scientists and mathematicians Nathan Liebknecht, Kurt G&ouml;del and&nbsp;Boris Podolsky, come up with a scheme to convince Catherine (and the world) that Ed is a scientific genius. The weak link as far as the acting was concerned was, in my view, Tim Robbins as Ed; l felt that the role needed someone more relaxed, less serious and younger. (The age difference between Robbins and Meg Ryan is only three years, but here it seems much greater). According to Schepisi, Robbins was unhappy with the way his character was written, feeling that nobody would like a man "who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie", and it seems as if some of this uneasiness comes across in his performance. (There is a difference in this respect between "IQ" and "Roxanne", where it is the unsympathetic, and ultimately unsuccessful, suitor, who pretends to a level of education which he does not possess). Ryan herself, however, makes a sweet and appealing heroine. In the nineties she (along with Julia Roberts) was Hollywood's official Queen of Romantic Comedy and here she achieves the feat (as did Daryl Hannah in "Roxanne") of playing a woman who is not only attractive but also educated and intelligent without resorting to that old "bespectacled bluestocking" clich&eacute;.&nbsp; Walter Matthau was one of those actors who never seemed to retire, or even to fade away, but carried on taking leading roles in major feature films throughout the eighth, and final, decade of his life. Perhaps his best-known role from this period was in "Grumpy Old Men", but his Albert Einstein, portrayed as loveably mischievous, kindly and fun-loving, is far from being a grumpy old man. His three colleagues are all played in much the same way, and as being around the same age as Einstein, although historically this is not accurate. (Kurt G&ouml;del, for example, would only have been in his forties at the time the film is set; Lou Jacobi, who plays him here, was 81 when the film was made). I wouldn't rate&nbsp;"IQ" quite as highly as&nbsp;"Roxanne", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties, although with a stronger male lead it might have fall into the same category. Steve Martin, the male lead in "Roxanne", is one of that film's great strengths, much better than Tim Robbins is here, although on the feminine side Meg Ryan is just as good as Daryl Hannah. Overall, however, "IQ" is a highly enjoyable comedy, warm and human with its central theme that life is as much about the heart as about the mind. 7/10

    I.Q was the Big Bang Theory of the 1990's. This romantic comedy directed by Fred Schepisi is a very charming film. The film is about friendly garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) who is trying to impress a smart Princeton University mathematician, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) by acting a newly discovery genius with some help with Catherine's Uncle, Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) and his buddies, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt G&ouml;del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks). The casting for Albert Einstein's friends almost were originally going to be Peter Ustinov, Barry Humphries and John Cleese. No matter who was cast, they see Edward as someone who would be better suited for Catherine, rather than her stiff and fussy English fianc&eacute;, experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). Things get heat up, when the science community heard about this 'wunderkind' genius work on Cold Fusion power rockets, and seek Edward to help the American take back, the space race from the Russians. I have to say, everybody is just charming. Tim Robbins is a fine actor who is believable, but he was a bit difficult during filming I heard. He said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. In my opinion, I didn't mind it, but I think Tim Robbins was right, because not a lot of people end up going to see this movie. Meg Ryan is a hot smart woman who looks wonderful in the poodle skirts. She looks really young in this role. Stephen Fry was pretty good, and at less, the filmmakers didn't make his character too unlikable. Last, I have to say Walter Matthau fit the part. He did a great job to the point that it seem like Albert Einstein was playing himself. For dramatic reasons, I.Q. fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt G&ouml;del was famously shy and reclusive, so he probably wouldn't be hanging out with Einstein and Boris Podolsky. I like how the movie didn't play it safe, by over explaining the calculations of the physics theories. If you don't get the jokes. It's alright. I didn't get some of the things, they were saying, too. Plus, I study physics before, coming into this film. I love to do my research, and I think I learn a lot from this film. I never heard of Hamiltonians, iambic pentameter, zeno paradox and others. The odd humor might leave some people scratching their heads, but overall, most of it was pretty simple to understand. The comedy works as well. I love the debate scene about if time exist or not. The whole I.Q test was funny, but a bit unrealistic. The Spike Jones music scene was pretty odd. The Marlon Brando impression was great. By the way, people, the impression was from 1953's Wild Ones and 1954's On the Waterfront, not 1972's the Godfather. I love the movie soundtrack very much from Jerry Goldsmith. The violin melody of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star was amazing to hear. Other songs heard was the Alphabet song, and some classical music from Wolfgang Mozart, and Joseph Haydn. Some critics didn't find the movie great, because Einstein in their eyes seem too silly or dumb. I doubt Einstein was such a hard head scientist. Einstein reportedly was playful and fond of jokes that could be seen by some as childish, but in the movie, he was indeed sound smart with all the terminology. I love how they got away with the PG rating with all the sexual innuendos, down speaks, and euphemism. There was a lot of dark humor as well like example, the man stuck in a box without a sense of time. Minus, the historic accuracies, this film is fun to watch. This romantic comedy is full of wahoo!

    IQ set back in the Fifties is a glorious story of young people in love in an optimistic age. Of course you have to be real optimistic if you think in any age that garage mechanic Tim Robbins is going to get Meg Ryan who is a mathematician. Furthermore she's engaged to a psychologist Stephen Fry who is one real drip as they would have said back in those days. Forgetting Robbins, you've got to wonder what Ryan could possibly see in Fry. Answer is intelligent, she's got the notion that if she marries a smart guy, she'll have smart kids. Believe me, that doesn't always work out. But when she stops at Tony Shalhoub's filling station and their eyes meet you know it's inevitable for Ryan and Robbins. They just need a matchmaker and who better than Uncle Albert. That's Uncle Albert Einstein that is who in his last years was the most distinguished member of the Princeton faculty. So what does Uncle Albert do, to bring Robbins up to her 'level' he has him expound a theory of 'nuclear fusion rocket fuel'. We'll have warp drive and way before Captain Kirk is doing his thing. And Robbins is a bright guy and has a lot of people going including those at the highest level. Walter Matthau plays Einstein and with his scene stealing abilities he dominates the film. Matthau has a set of other elderly professors who look a whole lot like that group writing the encyclopedia in Ball Of Fire. They aid and abet his deception. Someone did a bit of research on Einstein because he admits at the climax to being a poor mathematician. That was true in real life and it's a key point in resolving the whole affair. If you like romantic films and Walter Matthau than IQ is definitely the film for you.

    Normally I don't write reviews for movies that have been around awhile and/or have other good reviews (and there are many for this movie), but when I saw that the overall rating for this movie was a 6 I decided that I had to step in and record my vote as well as give it some props here. I.Q. is a treat. A nice, cute movie. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie ever made or that it will change your world, but it's a joy. Walter Matthau, as always, is great. Tim Robbins once again shows why any movie he's in is worth watching. (Well, maybe not The Hudsucker Proxy, but that's not his fault!!) And Meg Ryan simply glows. She has never looked or acted better. As with any good movie, the supporting cast also shines. There's some familiar faces like Lou Jacobi and some different faces. It is also a very nice looking movie. Maybe the Director coming from Australia is a factor as sometimes it takes an outsider to see the beauty of New Jersey!! And that Princeton part of Joisey is certainly beautiful. You'll enjoy yourself with this movie.

    A comedy of sorts, and yet a dream more than a real story. Why not? We have the right to dream, even about real life. A band of old German scientists who have found refuge in the US because they were Jewish, among whom Albert Einstein is the most prestigious, are enjoying the love that is nascent in Einstein's niece for a simple garage mechanic and they organize a prank to make him shine with the highest IQ possible, and since when you reach a certain level of intelligence nothing is impossible, those four men manage to make the young mathematician niece fall in love top over toes in all directions and she finally recognizes that love is probably more important in life than just mathematics and science and university and research. The rest is Jewish antics and humor about life and death, love and the unknowable, the mind, the spirit, the soul, the brain, or whatever is residing up there in the skull. Some say love is not always on time, and they are wrong because love is always on time for those who believe time does not exist, and they are numerous since time, you know, hours, minutes, seconds and weeks and months are nothing but a human intellectual construction on the basis of the experience of the duration of things that cannot be measured and is absolutely as regular as a clock that is speeding up going up and slowing down going down, or vice versa. And love is the compass that can keep you on the right road in the right direction towards the right destination that you may never reach because distance is like duration: it is unfathomable and infinite.

    This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it an 8!

    While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him). So anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.

    Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****

    Typically stupid modern American comedy. The language and sensibility are 1990s while using 1950s props and a mix of hair styles and clothes from whatever era. They should have left it in the 90s and made it Dr. Salk. Too bad because it is a good cast. Feels like it was written by teenagers. Two stars at best. It's really too bad because there are some scenes that begin quite cleverly and then fall very flat, not the actors fault really, it's just so poorly done. The movie tries desperately to be a throwback to some of the fun comedies made in the late 40s-early 50s...Monkey Business comes to mind, maybe even A Song is Born. All in all quite forgettable.

    I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fianc&eacute; (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun. The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the "RRRatman" and Ryan's fianc&eacute;; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body. The film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.

I.Q. is a treat. A nice, cute movie. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie ever made or that it will change your world, but it's a joy. Walter Matthau, as always, is great. Tim Robbins once again shows why any movie he's in is worth watching. (Well, maybe not The Hudsucker Proxy, but that's not his fault!!) And Meg Ryan simply glows. She has never looked or acted better. As with any good movie, the supporting cast also shines. There's some familiar faces like Lou Jacobi and some different faces. It is also a very nice looking movie. Maybe the Director coming from Australia is a factor as sometimes it takes an outsider to see the beauty of New Jersey!! And that Princeton part of Joisey is certainly beautiful. You'll enjoy yourself with this movie.

    A comedy of sorts, and yet a dream more than a real story. Why not? We have the right to dream, even about real life. A band of old German scientists who have found refuge in the US because they were Jewish, among whom Albert Einstein is the most prestigious, are enjoying the love that is nascent in Einstein's niece for a simple garage mechanic and they organize a prank to make him shine with the highest IQ possible, and since when you reach a certain level of intelligence nothing is impossible, those four men manage to make the young mathematician niece fall in love top over toes in all directions and she finally recognizes that love is probably more important in life than just mathematics and science and university and research. The rest is Jewish antics and humor about life and death, love and the unknowable, the mind, the spirit, the soul, the brain, or whatever is residing up there in the skull. Some say love is not always on time, and they are wrong because love is always on time for those who believe time does not exist, and they are numerous since time, you know, hours, minutes, seconds and weeks and months are nothing but a human intellectual construction on the basis of the experience of the duration of things that cannot be measured and is absolutely as regular as a clock that is speeding up going up and slowing down going down, or vice versa. And love is the compass that can keep you on the right road in the right direction towards the right destination that you may never reach because distance is like duration: it is unfathomable and infinite.

    This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it an 8!

    While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him). So anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.

    Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****

    Typically stupid modern American comedy. The language and sensibility are 1990s while using 1950s props and a mix of hair styles and clothes from whatever era. They should have left it in the 90s and made it Dr. Salk. Too bad because it is a good cast. Feels like it was written by teenagers. Two stars at best. It's really too bad because there are some scenes that begin quite cleverly and then fall very flat, not the actors fault really, it's just so poorly done. The movie tries desperately to be a throwback to some of the fun comedies made in the late 40s-early 50s...Monkey Business comes to mind, maybe even A Song is Born. All in all quite forgettable.

    I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fianc&eacute; (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun. The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the "RRRatman" and Ryan's fianc&eacute;; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body. The film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.

    I originally associated Fred Schepisi with true-life crime dramas like "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" and "A Cry in the Dark", both set in his native Australia, but he is clearly a versatile director who has also turned his hand to comedy. "I.Q." has a lot in common with&nbsp;"Roxanne", probably Schepisi's best-known comic movie made several years earlier. Both films are romantic comedies based upon a love- triangle with two men in love with the same woman. In both films the woman is a highly-educated intellectual, and in both one of the men tries to impress her by pretending to be more intelligent or more educated&nbsp;than he really is. In "Roxanne" the woman is an astronomer; here she is a mathematician, but we learn that her father was an astronomer and the appearance of comet plays an important role in both films. The action takes place in New Jersey in the 1950s. If you want to be precise, both Dwight D. Eisenhower (as&nbsp;President) and&nbsp;Albert Einstein appear as characters, so the action must take place between Ike's inauguration in January 1953 and Einstein's death in April 1955, but as the film takes a number of liberties with historical fact that sort of precision is not really necessary. (For example, Einstein is seen listening to&nbsp;Little Richard's&nbsp;"Tutti-Frutti," which was not released until after his death). The heroine is Catherine Boyd, Albert Einstein's (fictional) niece, who has obviously inherited her famous uncle's brains as she is a brilliant&nbsp;mathematics student at Princeton University. Her two admirers are Ed Walters, a garage mechanic, and her British fianc&eacute; James Moreland, a university lecturer in experimental psychology. As is normal in two-boys-in-love-with-one-girl type rom-coms, the two have very different personalities. Although Ed has good general intelligence he has little formal education, but is amiable and caring. James is academically brilliant but a pompous stuffed shirt who treats Catherine with&nbsp;patronising condescension, believing that her main function in life will be as mother to the brilliant children to be fathered by&nbsp;himself. Catherine's uncle Albert realises that James, for all his academic prowess, is a complete prat, so tries to persuade her that Ed would be much better suited to her. To this end he and three friends, the scientists and mathematicians Nathan Liebknecht, Kurt G&ouml;del and&nbsp;Boris Podolsky, come up with a scheme to convince Catherine (and the world) that Ed is a scientific genius. The weak link as far as the acting was concerned was, in my view, Tim Robbins as Ed; l felt that the role needed someone more relaxed, less serious and younger. (The age difference between Robbins and Meg Ryan is only three years, but here it seems much greater). According to Schepisi, Robbins was unhappy with the way his character was written, feeling that nobody would like a man "who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie", and it seems as if some of this uneasiness comes across in his performance. (There is a difference in this respect between "IQ" and "Roxanne", where it is the unsympathetic, and ultimately unsuccessful, suitor, who pretends to a level of education which he does not possess). Ryan herself, however, makes a sweet and appealing heroine. In the nineties she (along with Julia Roberts) was Hollywood's official Queen of Romantic Comedy and here she achieves the feat (as did Daryl Hannah in "Roxanne") of playing a woman who is not only attractive but also educated and intelligent without resorting to that old "bespectacled bluestocking" clich&eacute;.&nbsp; Walter Matthau was one of those actors who never seemed to retire, or even to fade away, but carried on taking leading roles in major feature films throughout the eighth, and final, decade of his life. Perhaps his best-known role from this period was in "Grumpy Old Men", but his Albert Einstein, portrayed as loveably mischievous, kindly and fun-loving, is far from being a grumpy old man. His three colleagues are all played in much the same way, and as being around the same age as Einstein, although historically this is not accurate. (Kurt G&ouml;del, for example, would only have been in his forties at the time the film is set; Lou Jacobi, who plays him here, was 81 when the film was made). I wouldn't rate&nbsp;"IQ" quite as highly as&nbsp;"Roxanne", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties, although with a stronger male lead it might have fall into the same category. Steve Martin, the male lead in "Roxanne", is one of that film's great strengths, much better than Tim Robbins is here, although on the feminine side Meg Ryan is just as good as Daryl Hannah. Overall, however, "IQ" is a highly enjoyable comedy, warm and human with its central theme that life is as much about the heart as about the mind. 7/10

    I.Q was the Big Bang Theory of the 1990's. This romantic comedy directed by Fred Schepisi is a very charming film. The film is about friendly garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) who is trying to impress a smart Princeton University mathematician, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) by acting a newly discovery genius with some help with Catherine's Uncle, Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) and his buddies, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt G&ouml;del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks). The casting for Albert Einstein's friends almost were originally going to be Peter Ustinov, Barry Humphries and John Cleese. No matter who was cast, they see Edward as someone who would be better suited for Catherine, rather than her stiff and fussy English fianc&eacute;, experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). Things get heat up, when the science community heard about this 'wunderkind' genius work on Cold Fusion power rockets, and seek Edward to help the American take back, the space race from the Russians. I have to say, everybody is just charming. Tim Robbins is a fine actor who is believable, but he was a bit difficult during filming I heard. He said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. In my opinion, I didn't mind it, but I think Tim Robbins was right, because not a lot of people end up going to see this movie. Meg Ryan is a hot smart woman who looks wonderful in the poodle skirts. She looks really young in this role. Stephen Fry was pretty good, and at less, the filmmakers didn't make his character too unlikable. Last, I have to say Walter Matthau fit the part. He did a great job to the point that it seem like Albert Einstein was playing himself. For dramatic reasons, I.Q. fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt G&ouml;del was famously shy and reclusive, so he probably wouldn't be hanging out with Einstein and Boris Podolsky. I like how the movie didn't play it safe, by over explaining the calculations of the physics theories. If you don't get the jokes. It's alright. I didn't get some of the things, they were saying, too. Plus, I study physics before, coming into this film. I love to do my research, and I think I learn a lot from this film. I never heard of Hamiltonians, iambic pentameter, zeno paradox and others. The odd humor might leave some people scratching their heads, but overall, most of it was pretty simple to understand. The comedy works as well. I love the debate scene about if time exist or not. The whole I.Q test was funny, but a bit unrealistic. The Spike Jones music scene was pretty odd. The Marlon Brando impression was great. By the way, people, the impression was from 1953's Wild Ones and 1954's On the Waterfront, not 1972's the Godfather. I love the movie soundtrack very much from Jerry Goldsmith. The violin melody of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star was amazing to hear. Other songs heard was the Alphabet song, and some classical music from Wolfgang Mozart, and Joseph Haydn. Some critics didn't find the movie great, because Einstein in their eyes seem too silly or dumb. I doubt Einstein was such a hard head scientist. Einstein reportedly was playful and fond of jokes that could be seen by some as childish, but in the movie, he was indeed sound smart with all the terminology. I love how they got away with the PG rating with all the sexual innuendos, down speaks, and euphemism. There was a lot of dark humor as well like example, the man stuck in a box without a sense of time. Minus, the historic accuracies, this film is fun to watch. This romantic comedy is full of wahoo!

    IQ set back in the Fifties is a glorious story of young people in love in an optimistic age. Of course you have to be real optimistic if you think in any age that garage mechanic Tim Robbins is going to get Meg Ryan who is a mathematician. Furthermore she's engaged to a psychologist Stephen Fry who is one real drip as they would have said back in those days. Forgetting Robbins, you've got to wonder what Ryan could possibly see in Fry. Answer is intelligent, she's got the notion that if she marries a smart guy, she'll have smart kids. Believe me, that doesn't always work out. But when she stops at Tony Shalhoub's filling station and their eyes meet you know it's inevitable for Ryan and Robbins. They just need a matchmaker and who better than Uncle Albert. That's Uncle Albert Einstein that is who in his last years was the most distinguished member of the Princeton faculty. So what does Uncle Albert do, to bring Robbins up to her 'level' he has him expound a theory of 'nuclear fusion rocket fuel'. We'll have warp drive and way before Captain Kirk is doing his thing. And Robbins is a bright guy and has a lot of people going including those at the highest level. Walter Matthau plays Einstein and with his scene stealing abilities he dominates the film. Matthau has a set of other elderly professors who look a whole lot like that group writing the encyclopedia in Ball Of Fire. They aid and abet his deception. Someone did a bit of research on Einstein because he admits at the climax to being a poor mathematician. That was true in real life and it's a key point in resolving the whole affair. If you like romantic films and Walter Matthau than IQ is definitely the film for you.

James is academically brilliant but a pompous stuffed shirt who treats Catherine with&nbsp;patronising condescension, believing that her main function in life will be as mother to the brilliant children to be fathered by&nbsp;himself. Catherine's uncle Albert realises that James, for all his academic prowess, is a complete prat, so tries to persuade her that Ed would be much better suited to her. To this end he and three friends, the scientists and mathematicians Nathan Liebknecht, Kurt G&ouml;del and&nbsp;Boris Podolsky, come up with a scheme to convince Catherine (and the world) that Ed is a scientific genius. The weak link as far as the acting was concerned was, in my view, Tim Robbins as Ed; l felt that the role needed someone more relaxed, less serious and younger. (The age difference between Robbins and Meg Ryan is only three years, but here it seems much greater). According to Schepisi, Robbins was unhappy with the way his character was written, feeling that nobody would like a man "who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie", and it seems as if some of this uneasiness comes across in his performance. (There is a difference in this respect between "IQ" and "Roxanne", where it is the unsympathetic, and ultimately unsuccessful, suitor, who pretends to a level of education which he does not possess). Ryan herself, however, makes a sweet and appealing heroine. In the nineties she (along with Julia Roberts) was Hollywood's official Queen of Romantic Comedy and here she achieves the feat (as did Daryl Hannah in "Roxanne") of playing a woman who is not only attractive but also educated and intelligent without resorting to that old "bespectacled bluestocking" clich&eacute;.&nbsp; Walter Matthau was one of those actors who never seemed to retire, or even to fade away, but carried on taking leading roles in major feature films throughout the eighth, and final, decade of his life. Perhaps his best-known role from this period was in "Grumpy Old Men", but his Albert Einstein, portrayed as loveably mischievous, kindly and fun-loving, is far from being a grumpy old man. His three colleagues are all played in much the same way, and as being around the same age as Einstein, although historically this is not accurate. (Kurt G&ouml;del, for example, would only have been in his forties at the time the film is set; Lou Jacobi, who plays him here, was 81 when the film was made). I wouldn't rate&nbsp;"IQ" quite as highly as&nbsp;"Roxanne", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties, although with a stronger male lead it might have fall into the same category. Steve Martin, the male lead in "Roxanne", is one of that film's great strengths, much better than Tim Robbins is here, although on the feminine side Meg Ryan is just as good as Daryl Hannah. Overall, however, "IQ" is a highly enjoyable comedy, warm and human with its central theme that life is as much about the heart as about the mind. 7/10

    I.Q was the Big Bang Theory of the 1990's. This romantic comedy directed by Fred Schepisi is a very charming film. The film is about friendly garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) who is trying to impress a smart Princeton University mathematician, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) by acting a newly discovery genius with some help with Catherine's Uncle, Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) and his buddies, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt G&ouml;del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks). The casting for Albert Einstein's friends almost were originally going to be Peter Ustinov, Barry Humphries and John Cleese. No matter who was cast, they see Edward as someone who would be better suited for Catherine, rather than her stiff and fussy English fianc&eacute;, experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). Things get heat up, when the science community heard about this 'wunderkind' genius work on Cold Fusion power rockets, and seek Edward to help the American take back, the space race from the Russians. I have to say, everybody is just charming. Tim Robbins is a fine actor who is believable, but he was a bit difficult during filming I heard. He said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. In my opinion, I didn't mind it, but I think Tim Robbins was right, because not a lot of people end up going to see this movie. Meg Ryan is a hot smart woman who looks wonderful in the poodle skirts. She looks really young in this role. Stephen Fry was pretty good, and at less, the filmmakers didn't make his character too unlikable. Last, I have to say Walter Matthau fit the part. He did a great job to the point that it seem like Albert Einstein was playing himself. For dramatic reasons, I.Q. fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt G&ouml;del was famously shy and reclusive, so he probably wouldn't be hanging out with Einstein and Boris Podolsky. I like how the movie didn't play it safe, by over explaining the calculations of the physics theories. If you don't get the jokes. It's alright. I didn't get some of the things, they were saying, too. Plus, I study physics before, coming into this film. I love to do my research, and I think I learn a lot from this film. I never heard of Hamiltonians, iambic pentameter, zeno paradox and others. The odd humor might leave some people scratching their heads, but overall, most of it was pretty simple to understand. The comedy works as well. I love the debate scene about if time exist or not. The whole I.Q test was funny, but a bit unrealistic. The Spike Jones music scene was pretty odd. The Marlon Brando impression was great. By the way, people, the impression was from 1953's Wild Ones and 1954's On the Waterfront, not 1972's the Godfather. I love the movie soundtrack very much from Jerry Goldsmith. The violin melody of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star was amazing to hear. Other songs heard was the Alphabet song, and some classical music from Wolfgang Mozart, and Joseph Haydn. Some critics didn't find the movie great, because Einstein in their eyes seem too silly or dumb. I doubt Einstein was such a hard head scientist. Einstein reportedly was playful and fond of jokes that could be seen by some as childish, but in the movie, he was indeed sound smart with all the terminology. I love how they got away with the PG rating with all the sexual innuendos, down speaks, and euphemism. There was a lot of dark humor as well like example, the man stuck in a box without a sense of time. Minus, the historic accuracies, this film is fun to watch. This romantic comedy is full of wahoo!

    IQ set back in the Fifties is a glorious story of young people in love in an optimistic age. Of course you have to be real optimistic if you think in any age that garage mechanic Tim Robbins is going to get Meg Ryan who is a mathematician. Furthermore she's engaged to a psychologist Stephen Fry who is one real drip as they would have said back in those days. Forgetting Robbins, you've got to wonder what Ryan could possibly see in Fry. Answer is intelligent, she's got the notion that if she marries a smart guy, she'll have smart kids. Believe me, that doesn't always work out. But when she stops at Tony Shalhoub's filling station and their eyes meet you know it's inevitable for Ryan and Robbins. They just need a matchmaker and who better than Uncle Albert. That's Uncle Albert Einstein that is who in his last years was the most distinguished member of the Princeton faculty. So what does Uncle Albert do, to bring Robbins up to her 'level' he has him expound a theory of 'nuclear fusion rocket fuel'. We'll have warp drive and way before Captain Kirk is doing his thing. And Robbins is a bright guy and has a lot of people going including those at the highest level. Walter Matthau plays Einstein and with his scene stealing abilities he dominates the film. Matthau has a set of other elderly professors who look a whole lot like that group writing the encyclopedia in Ball Of Fire. They aid and abet his deception. Someone did a bit of research on Einstein because he admits at the climax to being a poor mathematician. That was true in real life and it's a key point in resolving the whole affair. If you like romantic films and Walter Matthau than IQ is definitely the film for you.

    Normally I don't write reviews for movies that have been around awhile and/or have other good reviews (and there are many for this movie), but when I saw that the overall rating for this movie was a 6 I decided that I had to step in and record my vote as well as give it some props here. I.Q. is a treat. A nice, cute movie. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie ever made or that it will change your world, but it's a joy. Walter Matthau, as always, is great. Tim Robbins once again shows why any movie he's in is worth watching. (Well, maybe not The Hudsucker Proxy, but that's not his fault!!) And Meg Ryan simply glows. She has never looked or acted better. As with any good movie, the supporting cast also shines. There's some familiar faces like Lou Jacobi and some different faces. It is also a very nice looking movie. Maybe the Director coming from Australia is a factor as sometimes it takes an outsider to see the beauty of New Jersey!! And that Princeton part of Joisey is certainly beautiful. You'll enjoy yourself with this movie.

    A comedy of sorts, and yet a dream more than a real story. Why not? We have the right to dream, even about real life. A band of old German scientists who have found refuge in the US because they were Jewish, among whom Albert Einstein is the most prestigious, are enjoying the love that is nascent in Einstein's niece for a simple garage mechanic and they organize a prank to make him shine with the highest IQ possible, and since when you reach a certain level of intelligence nothing is impossible, those four men manage to make the young mathematician niece fall in love top over toes in all directions and she finally recognizes that love is probably more important in life than just mathematics and science and university and research. The rest is Jewish antics and humor about life and death, love and the unknowable, the mind, the spirit, the soul, the brain, or whatever is residing up there in the skull. Some say love is not always on time, and they are wrong because love is always on time for those who believe time does not exist, and they are numerous since time, you know, hours, minutes, seconds and weeks and months are nothing but a human intellectual construction on the basis of the experience of the duration of things that cannot be measured and is absolutely as regular as a clock that is speeding up going up and slowing down going down, or vice versa. And love is the compass that can keep you on the right road in the right direction towards the right destination that you may never reach because distance is like duration: it is unfathomable and infinite.

    This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it an 8!

    While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him). So anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.

    Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****

    Typically stupid modern American comedy. The language and sensibility are 1990s while using 1950s props and a mix of hair styles and clothes from whatever era. They should have left it in the 90s and made it Dr. Salk. Too bad because it is a good cast. Feels like it was written by teenagers. Two stars at best. It's really too bad because there are some scenes that begin quite cleverly and then fall very flat, not the actors fault really, it's just so poorly done. The movie tries desperately to be a throwback to some of the fun comedies made in the late 40s-early 50s...Monkey Business comes to mind, maybe even A Song is Born. All in all quite forgettable.

    I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fianc&eacute; (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun. The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the "RRRatman" and Ryan's fianc&eacute;; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body. The film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.

    I originally associated Fred Schepisi with true-life crime dramas like "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" and "A Cry in the Dark", both set in his native Australia, but he is clearly a versatile director who has also turned his hand to comedy. "I.Q." has a lot in common with&nbsp;"Roxanne", probably Schepisi's best-known comic movie made several years earlier. Both films are romantic comedies based upon a love- triangle with two men in love with the same woman. In both films the woman is a highly-educated intellectual, and in both one of the men tries to impress her by pretending to be more intelligent or more educated&nbsp;than he really is. In "Roxanne" the woman is an astronomer; here she is a mathematician, but we learn that her father was an astronomer and the appearance of comet plays an important role in both films. The action takes place in New Jersey in the 1950s. If you want to be precise, both Dwight D. Eisenhower (as&nbsp;President) and&nbsp;Albert Einstein appear as characters, so the action must take place between Ike's inauguration in January 1953 and Einstein's death in April 1955, but as the film takes a number of liberties with historical fact that sort of precision is not really necessary. (For example, Einstein is seen listening to&nbsp;Little Richard's&nbsp;"Tutti-Frutti," which was not released until after his death). The heroine is Catherine Boyd, Albert Einstein's (fictional) niece, who has obviously inherited her famous uncle's brains as she is a brilliant&nbsp;mathematics student at Princeton University. Her two admirers are Ed Walters, a garage mechanic, and her British fianc&eacute; James Moreland, a university lecturer in experimental psychology. As is normal in two-boys-in-love-with-one-girl type rom-coms, the two have very different personalities. Although Ed has good general intelligence he has little formal education, but is amiable and caring. James is academically brilliant but a pompous stuffed shirt who treats Catherine with&nbsp;patronising condescension, believing that her main function in life will be as mother to the brilliant children to be fathered by&nbsp;himself. Catherine's uncle Albert realises that James, for all his academic prowess, is a complete prat, so tries to persuade her that Ed would be much better suited to her. To this end he and three friends, the scientists and mathematicians Nathan Liebknecht, Kurt G&ouml;del and&nbsp;Boris Podolsky, come up with a scheme to convince Catherine (and the world) that Ed is a scientific genius. The weak link as far as the acting was concerned was, in my view, Tim Robbins as Ed; l felt that the role needed someone more relaxed, less serious and younger.

Some say love is not always on time, and they are wrong because love is always on time for those who believe time does not exist, and they are numerous since time, you know, hours, minutes, seconds and weeks and months are nothing but a human intellectual construction on the basis of the experience of the duration of things that cannot be measured and is absolutely as regular as a clock that is speeding up going up and slowing down going down, or vice versa. And love is the compass that can keep you on the right road in the right direction towards the right destination that you may never reach because distance is like duration: it is unfathomable and infinite.

    This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it an 8!

    While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him). So anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.

    Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****

    Typically stupid modern American comedy. The language and sensibility are 1990s while using 1950s props and a mix of hair styles and clothes from whatever era. They should have left it in the 90s and made it Dr. Salk. Too bad because it is a good cast. Feels like it was written by teenagers. Two stars at best. It's really too bad because there are some scenes that begin quite cleverly and then fall very flat, not the actors fault really, it's just so poorly done. The movie tries desperately to be a throwback to some of the fun comedies made in the late 40s-early 50s...Monkey Business comes to mind, maybe even A Song is Born. All in all quite forgettable.

    I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fianc&eacute; (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun. The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the "RRRatman" and Ryan's fianc&eacute;; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body. The film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.
