    Seventeen years passed since "Scream" was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like "Prom Night", among others. It's important to remember that even thought "Scream" criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change to way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legend". One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great "Scary Movie" franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit "Scream" feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.

    Had 'Scream' not come along, we might never have learned the formula to slasher flicks like 'Friday the 13th'. Other newsflashes include: the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels weren't very good, Jamie Lee Curtis made quite a few horror movies, and if people wander outside in these sort of films they usually don't come back. It is, in short, an irritating and self-congratulatory film, lacking the smarts and creativity to subvert the clich&eacute;s it feeds upon; they're talked about but nothing clever is done with them. This is no 'Cabin in the Woods' and Kevin Williamson is no Joss Whedon. Williamson's reign of ironic smuggery began with, and is summed up by, this tedious slasher, and I don't know what Wes Craven's so pleased about, as he covered similar ground with his 'New Nightmare'. Undeniably influential  but not in a good way.

    Wes Craven's Scream is a brilliant slasher film that not only satirizes the genre in which it is based on, but also provides plenty of its own thrills and chills. Our main heroine of the story is Sidney Prescott, a very flawed and likable character who tries to go through life dealing with the insulting media. She hangs out with her friends who all have distinct personalities, and finds solace in their company. Unfortunately, when two teens are brutally murdered, Sidney finds that the insidious plot is focused on her, and she soon realizes that her life is starting to become one great big horror movie, and she's the star. Scream took all of the clich&eacute;s and horror movie tropes found in the slasher genre (created from being milked to death), and used them to its advantage. It makes fun of all the tired repetitive mechanics that viewers are sick of. The film is also very self-aware, constantly referencing other horror movies, directors, celebrities, quotes, rules, and scenes. It's a real treat for all the horror fans out there. A lot of the humour is found in these references, but it's also created by the excellent cast of characters who are superbly acted. Everyone in this movie is likable, and if they're not, they become likable in their own way. The viewer really starts to care if these teens bite the dust; all of this is thanks to their individual personalities and dialogue, and a new and intimidating villain with an awesome voice, who eventually became a horror icon. Scream isn't just a satire though; it's its own horror thriller, packing enough gore and killing to make its way into the top list of slasher films. On a side note, the music score is wonderful to listen to, and the cinematography is also great. You don't really point it out in horror movies but there are a few scenes in here that are breathtaking to watch on Blu-Ray, such as the shot with Sidney standing on her back-porch overlooking the mountains and sunset. Wes Craven's Scream is an amazing addition to the slasher and mystery subgenres. It has become one of my favourite films over the years and I've watched it many, many times. It's a film I'll always have fond memories of, and I feel that all horror fans, and people getting into the genre, should definitely check it out.

    Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up "Sliced and Diced" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of "It's him"...."no no, He's the killer" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)

    Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although "Scream" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be. There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in "Scream", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life. Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make "Scream" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. *Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading! Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history. Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives "Scream" its signature style. If you haven't seen "Scream" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting! Plot: 8.5/10 Acting: 8/10 Cinematography: 6.5/10 Script: 7.5/10 Style/Originality: 9/10 Overall: 7.9/10

    *Very minor spoilers, and the minor ones are given a warning* "Several more local teens are dead, bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the masked killings that has terrified this peaceful community like the plot of some scary movie. It all began with the scream over 911, and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro. All played out here in this peaceful farmhouse, far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities that its residents have fled." In a time where Michael was boring, Freddy had lost his edge, and Jason hadn't had a good film in years, the horror genre was close to dead. And yet in that time, we get SCREAM (1996), a funny, new, and, most importantly, scary movie. For once, a horror film in which the characters had seen all the same movies we had. The film opens at the house of character Casey, played by the famous Drew Barrymore, who is getting ready to sit down and watch HALLOWEEN (1978), when she receives a mysterious call. The rest of the film is littered with comedic moments and horror references that any slasher fan should have a fun time identifying (keep an eye out for the name of Sidney's boyfriend, the number on Tatum's shirt, etc). And of course there is the famous line "There are certain RULES that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie." The film mentions rules which we have all learned by watching earlier slashers. There's the glaringly obvious "don't have sex", don't yell out "who's there?", don't drink, and more. And what SCREAM does is try to break every rule (though it is still rather unpredictable). Now, of course, I hate what SCREAM did to the genre. It revived the horror genre, and specifically the slasher sub-genre, but almost all of the films inspired by SCREAM were just annoying and cheesy films that were trying too hard to be self-aware and hip. Looking at you, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997) (it's hard to believe that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was written by the same writer of SCREAM). And, while the second SCREAM movie is still pretty good, the other two films in the franchise are horrible imitations, just as formulaic as the films SCREAM tried to defy. When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre. When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that. (Minor spoilers about the killer(s), no identity/identities are shared) While some argue that the killer(s)'s reason of recreating horror films (although another reason is that he/she/they are just crazy) is very unlikely, I honestly believe it was the only ending the film could have done. I mean, if it turned out to be some crazy act of revenge, or another standard slasher ending, I think we'd all feel a little cheated. And this is hardly the most ridiculous ending in the franchise (as much as I enjoy SCREAM 2, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and 3 and 4 are both some of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, though I'll save that for my future reviews of those films). All in all, SCREAM is a very fun, scary, and interesting horror film that actually brought something new to a genre that had been reduced to formulaic slashers for years (if only we could have another truly original film nowadays). There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years). Highly recommended.

    Scream is a great movie with a really clever storyline,with a good twist and also a great cast.Going into this movie I thought it would be really scary and I would possibly get nightmares from it,but it certainly wasn't,I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be or not,but a lot of this movie was really funny,and the overall story of the film was a lot of fun to watch as well.I really enjoyed Courteney Cox's performance as Gale Weathers,it was very different than anything else I've seen her in,and it actually took me awhile to realize it was her,I also really liked Matthew Lillard's performance.Fans of really scary horror movies will be disappointed,but people who don't like them too scary,a like a bit of comic relief should enjoy this. As a killer in a mask begins killing off teen angers,Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends use the rules and clich&eacute; of horror movies to survive.

    This movie is cool. There are violent scenes, and is denominate as a horror movie. This is a lie! This movie is sarcastic to horror genre! There is no horror and thriller! This movie is very good,gory,bloody,sexy,smart... From the same director of Nightmare on Elm Street. This is really a horror movie. This movie is fun! Exciting! With a teenager named Drew Barrymore! But is spoiler,so,i'll not tell. Enjoy Scream! He's a very good movie! There's Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4, also directed by Wes Craven. Enjoy this movie. Is a smart, and delicious movie. Starring: Neve Campbell. I watched this movie past year, my friend said that this is a very frightening horror movie. I believed. But when I saw, I wet my pants because I this is very funny. There's no spoilers in my review, but if you think that is, write a review. Because i'll know who thinks that I'm a jerk to write spoilers. Enjoy the movie!

    This is one of the slasher movies that made me start to like them as this one is an excellent slasher/horror movie takeoff as there are scares and laughs abroad. The characters are fun to watch and very enjoyable as it is one of the better crews in a horror movie. The gore level is really high as it is impressive early and a little silly later, but fun to watch at times anyway. The script is well done with its jokes and gags with the one thing surprisingly impressing to me was the phone voice. Hidden tones have been used before to hide voices, but I liked this one a lot as it is not as deep as the other one which is used almost everywhere today and the sound gives you chills as it is not mean sounding but has a different kind of tone which gave me chills. They both disguised the villain well but not well either. I guessed right, but was not ready for the other surprise. This is an excellent horror film. This is Wes Craven's passion.

    I don't understand why so many sequels were made to this movie. It was kinda boring. The opening scene was really good, so I expected the rest to be just as good. But it sadly wasn't. They should have killed off Gale ( Courtney Cox ), Or Dewey ( David Arquette ) in this movie. Now, there are rumors of a Scream 5, and Cox and Arquette are still alive with Neve Campbell! This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears. Probably suitable for 13+. Some people may enjoy this film, but it honestly bored me.

If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading! Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history. Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives "Scream" its signature style. If you haven't seen "Scream" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting! Plot: 8.5/10 Acting: 8/10 Cinematography: 6.5/10 Script: 7.5/10 Style/Originality: 9/10 Overall: 7.9/10

    *Very minor spoilers, and the minor ones are given a warning* "Several more local teens are dead, bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the masked killings that has terrified this peaceful community like the plot of some scary movie. It all began with the scream over 911, and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro. All played out here in this peaceful farmhouse, far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities that its residents have fled." In a time where Michael was boring, Freddy had lost his edge, and Jason hadn't had a good film in years, the horror genre was close to dead. And yet in that time, we get SCREAM (1996), a funny, new, and, most importantly, scary movie. For once, a horror film in which the characters had seen all the same movies we had. The film opens at the house of character Casey, played by the famous Drew Barrymore, who is getting ready to sit down and watch HALLOWEEN (1978), when she receives a mysterious call. The rest of the film is littered with comedic moments and horror references that any slasher fan should have a fun time identifying (keep an eye out for the name of Sidney's boyfriend, the number on Tatum's shirt, etc). And of course there is the famous line "There are certain RULES that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie." The film mentions rules which we have all learned by watching earlier slashers. There's the glaringly obvious "don't have sex", don't yell out "who's there?", don't drink, and more. And what SCREAM does is try to break every rule (though it is still rather unpredictable). Now, of course, I hate what SCREAM did to the genre. It revived the horror genre, and specifically the slasher sub-genre, but almost all of the films inspired by SCREAM were just annoying and cheesy films that were trying too hard to be self-aware and hip. Looking at you, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997) (it's hard to believe that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was written by the same writer of SCREAM). And, while the second SCREAM movie is still pretty good, the other two films in the franchise are horrible imitations, just as formulaic as the films SCREAM tried to defy. When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre. When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that. (Minor spoilers about the killer(s), no identity/identities are shared) While some argue that the killer(s)'s reason of recreating horror films (although another reason is that he/she/they are just crazy) is very unlikely, I honestly believe it was the only ending the film could have done. I mean, if it turned out to be some crazy act of revenge, or another standard slasher ending, I think we'd all feel a little cheated. And this is hardly the most ridiculous ending in the franchise (as much as I enjoy SCREAM 2, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and 3 and 4 are both some of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, though I'll save that for my future reviews of those films). All in all, SCREAM is a very fun, scary, and interesting horror film that actually brought something new to a genre that had been reduced to formulaic slashers for years (if only we could have another truly original film nowadays). There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years). Highly recommended.

    Scream is a great movie with a really clever storyline,with a good twist and also a great cast.Going into this movie I thought it would be really scary and I would possibly get nightmares from it,but it certainly wasn't,I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be or not,but a lot of this movie was really funny,and the overall story of the film was a lot of fun to watch as well.I really enjoyed Courteney Cox's performance as Gale Weathers,it was very different than anything else I've seen her in,and it actually took me awhile to realize it was her,I also really liked Matthew Lillard's performance.Fans of really scary horror movies will be disappointed,but people who don't like them too scary,a like a bit of comic relief should enjoy this. As a killer in a mask begins killing off teen angers,Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends use the rules and clich&eacute; of horror movies to survive.

    This movie is cool. There are violent scenes, and is denominate as a horror movie. This is a lie! This movie is sarcastic to horror genre! There is no horror and thriller! This movie is very good,gory,bloody,sexy,smart... From the same director of Nightmare on Elm Street. This is really a horror movie. This movie is fun! Exciting! With a teenager named Drew Barrymore! But is spoiler,so,i'll not tell. Enjoy Scream! He's a very good movie! There's Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4, also directed by Wes Craven. Enjoy this movie. Is a smart, and delicious movie. Starring: Neve Campbell. I watched this movie past year, my friend said that this is a very frightening horror movie. I believed. But when I saw, I wet my pants because I this is very funny. There's no spoilers in my review, but if you think that is, write a review. Because i'll know who thinks that I'm a jerk to write spoilers. Enjoy the movie!

    This is one of the slasher movies that made me start to like them as this one is an excellent slasher/horror movie takeoff as there are scares and laughs abroad. The characters are fun to watch and very enjoyable as it is one of the better crews in a horror movie. The gore level is really high as it is impressive early and a little silly later, but fun to watch at times anyway. The script is well done with its jokes and gags with the one thing surprisingly impressing to me was the phone voice. Hidden tones have been used before to hide voices, but I liked this one a lot as it is not as deep as the other one which is used almost everywhere today and the sound gives you chills as it is not mean sounding but has a different kind of tone which gave me chills. They both disguised the villain well but not well either. I guessed right, but was not ready for the other surprise. This is an excellent horror film. This is Wes Craven's passion.

    I don't understand why so many sequels were made to this movie. It was kinda boring. The opening scene was really good, so I expected the rest to be just as good. But it sadly wasn't. They should have killed off Gale ( Courtney Cox ), Or Dewey ( David Arquette ) in this movie. Now, there are rumors of a Scream 5, and Cox and Arquette are still alive with Neve Campbell! This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears. Probably suitable for 13+. Some people may enjoy this film, but it honestly bored me.

    Seventeen years passed since "Scream" was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like "Prom Night", among others. It's important to remember that even thought "Scream" criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change to way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legend". One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great "Scary Movie" franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit "Scream" feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.

    Had 'Scream' not come along, we might never have learned the formula to slasher flicks like 'Friday the 13th'. Other newsflashes include: the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels weren't very good, Jamie Lee Curtis made quite a few horror movies, and if people wander outside in these sort of films they usually don't come back. It is, in short, an irritating and self-congratulatory film, lacking the smarts and creativity to subvert the clich&eacute;s it feeds upon; they're talked about but nothing clever is done with them. This is no 'Cabin in the Woods' and Kevin Williamson is no Joss Whedon. Williamson's reign of ironic smuggery began with, and is summed up by, this tedious slasher, and I don't know what Wes Craven's so pleased about, as he covered similar ground with his 'New Nightmare'. Undeniably influential  but not in a good way.

    Wes Craven's Scream is a brilliant slasher film that not only satirizes the genre in which it is based on, but also provides plenty of its own thrills and chills. Our main heroine of the story is Sidney Prescott, a very flawed and likable character who tries to go through life dealing with the insulting media. She hangs out with her friends who all have distinct personalities, and finds solace in their company. Unfortunately, when two teens are brutally murdered, Sidney finds that the insidious plot is focused on her, and she soon realizes that her life is starting to become one great big horror movie, and she's the star. Scream took all of the clich&eacute;s and horror movie tropes found in the slasher genre (created from being milked to death), and used them to its advantage. It makes fun of all the tired repetitive mechanics that viewers are sick of. The film is also very self-aware, constantly referencing other horror movies, directors, celebrities, quotes, rules, and scenes. It's a real treat for all the horror fans out there. A lot of the humour is found in these references, but it's also created by the excellent cast of characters who are superbly acted. Everyone in this movie is likable, and if they're not, they become likable in their own way. The viewer really starts to care if these teens bite the dust; all of this is thanks to their individual personalities and dialogue, and a new and intimidating villain with an awesome voice, who eventually became a horror icon. Scream isn't just a satire though; it's its own horror thriller, packing enough gore and killing to make its way into the top list of slasher films. On a side note, the music score is wonderful to listen to, and the cinematography is also great. You don't really point it out in horror movies but there are a few scenes in here that are breathtaking to watch on Blu-Ray, such as the shot with Sidney standing on her back-porch overlooking the mountains and sunset. Wes Craven's Scream is an amazing addition to the slasher and mystery subgenres. It has become one of my favourite films over the years and I've watched it many, many times. It's a film I'll always have fond memories of, and I feel that all horror fans, and people getting into the genre, should definitely check it out.

    Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up "Sliced and Diced" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of "It's him"...."no no, He's the killer" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)

    Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although "Scream" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be. There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in "Scream", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life. Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make "Scream" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. *Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading! Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer.

    Seventeen years passed since "Scream" was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like "Prom Night", among others. It's important to remember that even thought "Scream" criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change to way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legend". One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great "Scary Movie" franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit "Scream" feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.

    Had 'Scream' not come along, we might never have learned the formula to slasher flicks like 'Friday the 13th'. Other newsflashes include: the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels weren't very good, Jamie Lee Curtis made quite a few horror movies, and if people wander outside in these sort of films they usually don't come back. It is, in short, an irritating and self-congratulatory film, lacking the smarts and creativity to subvert the clich&eacute;s it feeds upon; they're talked about but nothing clever is done with them. This is no 'Cabin in the Woods' and Kevin Williamson is no Joss Whedon. Williamson's reign of ironic smuggery began with, and is summed up by, this tedious slasher, and I don't know what Wes Craven's so pleased about, as he covered similar ground with his 'New Nightmare'. Undeniably influential  but not in a good way.

    Wes Craven's Scream is a brilliant slasher film that not only satirizes the genre in which it is based on, but also provides plenty of its own thrills and chills. Our main heroine of the story is Sidney Prescott, a very flawed and likable character who tries to go through life dealing with the insulting media. She hangs out with her friends who all have distinct personalities, and finds solace in their company. Unfortunately, when two teens are brutally murdered, Sidney finds that the insidious plot is focused on her, and she soon realizes that her life is starting to become one great big horror movie, and she's the star. Scream took all of the clich&eacute;s and horror movie tropes found in the slasher genre (created from being milked to death), and used them to its advantage. It makes fun of all the tired repetitive mechanics that viewers are sick of. The film is also very self-aware, constantly referencing other horror movies, directors, celebrities, quotes, rules, and scenes. It's a real treat for all the horror fans out there. A lot of the humour is found in these references, but it's also created by the excellent cast of characters who are superbly acted. Everyone in this movie is likable, and if they're not, they become likable in their own way. The viewer really starts to care if these teens bite the dust; all of this is thanks to their individual personalities and dialogue, and a new and intimidating villain with an awesome voice, who eventually became a horror icon. Scream isn't just a satire though; it's its own horror thriller, packing enough gore and killing to make its way into the top list of slasher films. On a side note, the music score is wonderful to listen to, and the cinematography is also great. You don't really point it out in horror movies but there are a few scenes in here that are breathtaking to watch on Blu-Ray, such as the shot with Sidney standing on her back-porch overlooking the mountains and sunset. Wes Craven's Scream is an amazing addition to the slasher and mystery subgenres. It has become one of my favourite films over the years and I've watched it many, many times. It's a film I'll always have fond memories of, and I feel that all horror fans, and people getting into the genre, should definitely check it out.

    Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up "Sliced and Diced" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of "It's him"...."no no, He's the killer" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)

    Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although "Scream" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be. There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in "Scream", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life. Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make "Scream" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. *Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading! Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history. Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives "Scream" its signature style. If you haven't seen "Scream" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting! Plot: 8.5/10 Acting: 8/10 Cinematography: 6.5/10 Script: 7.5/10 Style/Originality: 9/10 Overall: 7.9/10

    *Very minor spoilers, and the minor ones are given a warning* "Several more local teens are dead, bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the masked killings that has terrified this peaceful community like the plot of some scary movie. It all began with the scream over 911, and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro. All played out here in this peaceful farmhouse, far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities that its residents have fled." In a time where Michael was boring, Freddy had lost his edge, and Jason hadn't had a good film in years, the horror genre was close to dead. And yet in that time, we get SCREAM (1996), a funny, new, and, most importantly, scary movie. For once, a horror film in which the characters had seen all the same movies we had. The film opens at the house of character Casey, played by the famous Drew Barrymore, who is getting ready to sit down and watch HALLOWEEN (1978), when she receives a mysterious call. The rest of the film is littered with comedic moments and horror references that any slasher fan should have a fun time identifying (keep an eye out for the name of Sidney's boyfriend, the number on Tatum's shirt, etc). And of course there is the famous line "There are certain RULES that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie." The film mentions rules which we have all learned by watching earlier slashers. There's the glaringly obvious "don't have sex", don't yell out "who's there?", don't drink, and more. And what SCREAM does is try to break every rule (though it is still rather unpredictable). Now, of course, I hate what SCREAM did to the genre. It revived the horror genre, and specifically the slasher sub-genre, but almost all of the films inspired by SCREAM were just annoying and cheesy films that were trying too hard to be self-aware and hip. Looking at you, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997) (it's hard to believe that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was written by the same writer of SCREAM). And, while the second SCREAM movie is still pretty good, the other two films in the franchise are horrible imitations, just as formulaic as the films SCREAM tried to defy. When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre. When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that. (Minor spoilers about the killer(s), no identity/identities are shared) While some argue that the killer(s)'s reason of recreating horror films (although another reason is that he/she/they are just crazy) is very unlikely, I honestly believe it was the only ending the film could have done. I mean, if it turned out to be some crazy act of revenge, or another standard slasher ending, I think we'd all feel a little cheated. And this is hardly the most ridiculous ending in the franchise (as much as I enjoy SCREAM 2, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and 3 and 4 are both some of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, though I'll save that for my future reviews of those films). All in all, SCREAM is a very fun, scary, and interesting horror film that actually brought something new to a genre that had been reduced to formulaic slashers for years (if only we could have another truly original film nowadays). There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years). Highly recommended.

    Scream is a great movie with a really clever storyline,with a good twist and also a great cast.Going into this movie I thought it would be really scary and I would possibly get nightmares from it,but it certainly wasn't,I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be or not,but a lot of this movie was really funny,and the overall story of the film was a lot of fun to watch as well.I really enjoyed Courteney Cox's performance as Gale Weathers,it was very different than anything else I've seen her in,and it actually took me awhile to realize it was her,I also really liked Matthew Lillard's performance.Fans of really scary horror movies will be disappointed,but people who don't like them too scary,a like a bit of comic relief should enjoy this. As a killer in a mask begins killing off teen angers,Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends use the rules and clich&eacute; of horror movies to survive.

    This movie is cool. There are violent scenes, and is denominate as a horror movie. This is a lie! This movie is sarcastic to horror genre! There is no horror and thriller! This movie is very good,gory,bloody,sexy,smart... From the same director of Nightmare on Elm Street. This is really a horror movie. This movie is fun! Exciting! With a teenager named Drew Barrymore! But is spoiler,so,i'll not tell. Enjoy Scream! He's a very good movie! There's Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4, also directed by Wes Craven. Enjoy this movie. Is a smart, and delicious movie. Starring: Neve Campbell. I watched this movie past year, my friend said that this is a very frightening horror movie. I believed. But when I saw, I wet my pants because I this is very funny. There's no spoilers in my review, but if you think that is, write a review. Because i'll know who thinks that I'm a jerk to write spoilers. Enjoy the movie!

    This is one of the slasher movies that made me start to like them as this one is an excellent slasher/horror movie takeoff as there are scares and laughs abroad. The characters are fun to watch and very enjoyable as it is one of the better crews in a horror movie. The gore level is really high as it is impressive early and a little silly later, but fun to watch at times anyway. The script is well done with its jokes and gags with the one thing surprisingly impressing to me was the phone voice. Hidden tones have been used before to hide voices, but I liked this one a lot as it is not as deep as the other one which is used almost everywhere today and the sound gives you chills as it is not mean sounding but has a different kind of tone which gave me chills. They both disguised the villain well but not well either. I guessed right, but was not ready for the other surprise. This is an excellent horror film. This is Wes Craven's passion.

    I don't understand why so many sequels were made to this movie. It was kinda boring. The opening scene was really good, so I expected the rest to be just as good. But it sadly wasn't. They should have killed off Gale ( Courtney Cox ), Or Dewey ( David Arquette ) in this movie. Now, there are rumors of a Scream 5, and Cox and Arquette are still alive with Neve Campbell! This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears. Probably suitable for 13+. Some people may enjoy this film, but it honestly bored me.

All played out here in this peaceful farmhouse, far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities that its residents have fled." In a time where Michael was boring, Freddy had lost his edge, and Jason hadn't had a good film in years, the horror genre was close to dead. And yet in that time, we get SCREAM (1996), a funny, new, and, most importantly, scary movie. For once, a horror film in which the characters had seen all the same movies we had. The film opens at the house of character Casey, played by the famous Drew Barrymore, who is getting ready to sit down and watch HALLOWEEN (1978), when she receives a mysterious call. The rest of the film is littered with comedic moments and horror references that any slasher fan should have a fun time identifying (keep an eye out for the name of Sidney's boyfriend, the number on Tatum's shirt, etc). And of course there is the famous line "There are certain RULES that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie." The film mentions rules which we have all learned by watching earlier slashers. There's the glaringly obvious "don't have sex", don't yell out "who's there?", don't drink, and more. And what SCREAM does is try to break every rule (though it is still rather unpredictable). Now, of course, I hate what SCREAM did to the genre. It revived the horror genre, and specifically the slasher sub-genre, but almost all of the films inspired by SCREAM were just annoying and cheesy films that were trying too hard to be self-aware and hip. Looking at you, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997) (it's hard to believe that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was written by the same writer of SCREAM). And, while the second SCREAM movie is still pretty good, the other two films in the franchise are horrible imitations, just as formulaic as the films SCREAM tried to defy. When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre. When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that. (Minor spoilers about the killer(s), no identity/identities are shared) While some argue that the killer(s)'s reason of recreating horror films (although another reason is that he/she/they are just crazy) is very unlikely, I honestly believe it was the only ending the film could have done. I mean, if it turned out to be some crazy act of revenge, or another standard slasher ending, I think we'd all feel a little cheated. And this is hardly the most ridiculous ending in the franchise (as much as I enjoy SCREAM 2, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and 3 and 4 are both some of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, though I'll save that for my future reviews of those films). All in all, SCREAM is a very fun, scary, and interesting horror film that actually brought something new to a genre that had been reduced to formulaic slashers for years (if only we could have another truly original film nowadays). There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years). Highly recommended.

    Scream is a great movie with a really clever storyline,with a good twist and also a great cast.Going into this movie I thought it would be really scary and I would possibly get nightmares from it,but it certainly wasn't,I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be or not,but a lot of this movie was really funny,and the overall story of the film was a lot of fun to watch as well.I really enjoyed Courteney Cox's performance as Gale Weathers,it was very different than anything else I've seen her in,and it actually took me awhile to realize it was her,I also really liked Matthew Lillard's performance.Fans of really scary horror movies will be disappointed,but people who don't like them too scary,a like a bit of comic relief should enjoy this. As a killer in a mask begins killing off teen angers,Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends use the rules and clich&eacute; of horror movies to survive.

    This movie is cool. There are violent scenes, and is denominate as a horror movie. This is a lie! This movie is sarcastic to horror genre! There is no horror and thriller! This movie is very good,gory,bloody,sexy,smart... From the same director of Nightmare on Elm Street. This is really a horror movie. This movie is fun! Exciting! With a teenager named Drew Barrymore! But is spoiler,so,i'll not tell. Enjoy Scream! He's a very good movie! There's Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4, also directed by Wes Craven. Enjoy this movie. Is a smart, and delicious movie. Starring: Neve Campbell. I watched this movie past year, my friend said that this is a very frightening horror movie. I believed. But when I saw, I wet my pants because I this is very funny. There's no spoilers in my review, but if you think that is, write a review. Because i'll know who thinks that I'm a jerk to write spoilers. Enjoy the movie!

    This is one of the slasher movies that made me start to like them as this one is an excellent slasher/horror movie takeoff as there are scares and laughs abroad. The characters are fun to watch and very enjoyable as it is one of the better crews in a horror movie. The gore level is really high as it is impressive early and a little silly later, but fun to watch at times anyway. The script is well done with its jokes and gags with the one thing surprisingly impressing to me was the phone voice. Hidden tones have been used before to hide voices, but I liked this one a lot as it is not as deep as the other one which is used almost everywhere today and the sound gives you chills as it is not mean sounding but has a different kind of tone which gave me chills. They both disguised the villain well but not well either. I guessed right, but was not ready for the other surprise. This is an excellent horror film. This is Wes Craven's passion.

    I don't understand why so many sequels were made to this movie. It was kinda boring. The opening scene was really good, so I expected the rest to be just as good. But it sadly wasn't. They should have killed off Gale ( Courtney Cox ), Or Dewey ( David Arquette ) in this movie. Now, there are rumors of a Scream 5, and Cox and Arquette are still alive with Neve Campbell! This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears. Probably suitable for 13+. Some people may enjoy this film, but it honestly bored me.

    Seventeen years passed since "Scream" was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like "Prom Night", among others. It's important to remember that even thought "Scream" criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change to way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legend". One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great "Scary Movie" franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit "Scream" feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.

    Had 'Scream' not come along, we might never have learned the formula to slasher flicks like 'Friday the 13th'. Other newsflashes include: the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels weren't very good, Jamie Lee Curtis made quite a few horror movies, and if people wander outside in these sort of films they usually don't come back. It is, in short, an irritating and self-congratulatory film, lacking the smarts and creativity to subvert the clich&eacute;s it feeds upon; they're talked about but nothing clever is done with them. This is no 'Cabin in the Woods' and Kevin Williamson is no Joss Whedon. Williamson's reign of ironic smuggery began with, and is summed up by, this tedious slasher, and I don't know what Wes Craven's so pleased about, as he covered similar ground with his 'New Nightmare'. Undeniably influential  but not in a good way.

    Wes Craven's Scream is a brilliant slasher film that not only satirizes the genre in which it is based on, but also provides plenty of its own thrills and chills. Our main heroine of the story is Sidney Prescott, a very flawed and likable character who tries to go through life dealing with the insulting media. She hangs out with her friends who all have distinct personalities, and finds solace in their company. Unfortunately, when two teens are brutally murdered, Sidney finds that the insidious plot is focused on her, and she soon realizes that her life is starting to become one great big horror movie, and she's the star. Scream took all of the clich&eacute;s and horror movie tropes found in the slasher genre (created from being milked to death), and used them to its advantage. It makes fun of all the tired repetitive mechanics that viewers are sick of. The film is also very self-aware, constantly referencing other horror movies, directors, celebrities, quotes, rules, and scenes. It's a real treat for all the horror fans out there. A lot of the humour is found in these references, but it's also created by the excellent cast of characters who are superbly acted. Everyone in this movie is likable, and if they're not, they become likable in their own way. The viewer really starts to care if these teens bite the dust; all of this is thanks to their individual personalities and dialogue, and a new and intimidating villain with an awesome voice, who eventually became a horror icon. Scream isn't just a satire though; it's its own horror thriller, packing enough gore and killing to make its way into the top list of slasher films. On a side note, the music score is wonderful to listen to, and the cinematography is also great. You don't really point it out in horror movies but there are a few scenes in here that are breathtaking to watch on Blu-Ray, such as the shot with Sidney standing on her back-porch overlooking the mountains and sunset. Wes Craven's Scream is an amazing addition to the slasher and mystery subgenres. It has become one of my favourite films over the years and I've watched it many, many times. It's a film I'll always have fond memories of, and I feel that all horror fans, and people getting into the genre, should definitely check it out.

    Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up "Sliced and Diced" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of "It's him"...."no no, He's the killer" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)

    Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although "Scream" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be. There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in "Scream", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life. Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make "Scream" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. *Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading! Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history. Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives "Scream" its signature style. If you haven't seen "Scream" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting! Plot: 8.5/10 Acting: 8/10 Cinematography: 6.5/10 Script: 7.5/10 Style/Originality: 9/10 Overall: 7.9/10

    Had 'Scream' not come along, we might never have learned the formula to slasher flicks like 'Friday the 13th'. Other newsflashes include: the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels weren't very good, Jamie Lee Curtis made quite a few horror movies, and if people wander outside in these sort of films they usually don't come back. It is, in short, an irritating and self-congratulatory film, lacking the smarts and creativity to subvert the clich&eacute;s it feeds upon; they're talked about but nothing clever is done with them. This is no 'Cabin in the Woods' and Kevin Williamson is no Joss Whedon. Williamson's reign of ironic smuggery began with, and is summed up by, this tedious slasher, and I don't know what Wes Craven's so pleased about, as he covered similar ground with his 'New Nightmare'. Undeniably influential  but not in a good way.

    Wes Craven's Scream is a brilliant slasher film that not only satirizes the genre in which it is based on, but also provides plenty of its own thrills and chills. Our main heroine of the story is Sidney Prescott, a very flawed and likable character who tries to go through life dealing with the insulting media. She hangs out with her friends who all have distinct personalities, and finds solace in their company. Unfortunately, when two teens are brutally murdered, Sidney finds that the insidious plot is focused on her, and she soon realizes that her life is starting to become one great big horror movie, and she's the star. Scream took all of the clich&eacute;s and horror movie tropes found in the slasher genre (created from being milked to death), and used them to its advantage. It makes fun of all the tired repetitive mechanics that viewers are sick of. The film is also very self-aware, constantly referencing other horror movies, directors, celebrities, quotes, rules, and scenes. It's a real treat for all the horror fans out there. A lot of the humour is found in these references, but it's also created by the excellent cast of characters who are superbly acted. Everyone in this movie is likable, and if they're not, they become likable in their own way. The viewer really starts to care if these teens bite the dust; all of this is thanks to their individual personalities and dialogue, and a new and intimidating villain with an awesome voice, who eventually became a horror icon. Scream isn't just a satire though; it's its own horror thriller, packing enough gore and killing to make its way into the top list of slasher films. On a side note, the music score is wonderful to listen to, and the cinematography is also great. You don't really point it out in horror movies but there are a few scenes in here that are breathtaking to watch on Blu-Ray, such as the shot with Sidney standing on her back-porch overlooking the mountains and sunset. Wes Craven's Scream is an amazing addition to the slasher and mystery subgenres. It has become one of my favourite films over the years and I've watched it many, many times. It's a film I'll always have fond memories of, and I feel that all horror fans, and people getting into the genre, should definitely check it out.

    Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up "Sliced and Diced" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of "It's him"...."no no, He's the killer" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)

    Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although "Scream" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be. There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in "Scream", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life. Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make "Scream" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. *Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading! Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history. Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives "Scream" its signature style. If you haven't seen "Scream" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting! Plot: 8.5/10 Acting: 8/10 Cinematography: 6.5/10 Script: 7.5/10 Style/Originality: 9/10 Overall: 7.9/10

    *Very minor spoilers, and the minor ones are given a warning* "Several more local teens are dead, bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the masked killings that has terrified this peaceful community like the plot of some scary movie. It all began with the scream over 911, and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro. All played out here in this peaceful farmhouse, far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities that its residents have fled." In a time where Michael was boring, Freddy had lost his edge, and Jason hadn't had a good film in years, the horror genre was close to dead. And yet in that time, we get SCREAM (1996), a funny, new, and, most importantly, scary movie. For once, a horror film in which the characters had seen all the same movies we had. The film opens at the house of character Casey, played by the famous Drew Barrymore, who is getting ready to sit down and watch HALLOWEEN (1978), when she receives a mysterious call. The rest of the film is littered with comedic moments and horror references that any slasher fan should have a fun time identifying (keep an eye out for the name of Sidney's boyfriend, the number on Tatum's shirt, etc). And of course there is the famous line "There are certain RULES that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie." The film mentions rules which we have all learned by watching earlier slashers. There's the glaringly obvious "don't have sex", don't yell out "who's there?", don't drink, and more. And what SCREAM does is try to break every rule (though it is still rather unpredictable). Now, of course, I hate what SCREAM did to the genre. It revived the horror genre, and specifically the slasher sub-genre, but almost all of the films inspired by SCREAM were just annoying and cheesy films that were trying too hard to be self-aware and hip. Looking at you, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997) (it's hard to believe that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was written by the same writer of SCREAM). And, while the second SCREAM movie is still pretty good, the other two films in the franchise are horrible imitations, just as formulaic as the films SCREAM tried to defy. When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre. When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that. (Minor spoilers about the killer(s), no identity/identities are shared) While some argue that the killer(s)'s reason of recreating horror films (although another reason is that he/she/they are just crazy) is very unlikely, I honestly believe it was the only ending the film could have done. I mean, if it turned out to be some crazy act of revenge, or another standard slasher ending, I think we'd all feel a little cheated. And this is hardly the most ridiculous ending in the franchise (as much as I enjoy SCREAM 2, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and 3 and 4 are both some of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, though I'll save that for my future reviews of those films). All in all, SCREAM is a very fun, scary, and interesting horror film that actually brought something new to a genre that had been reduced to formulaic slashers for years (if only we could have another truly original film nowadays). There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years). Highly recommended.

    Scream is a great movie with a really clever storyline,with a good twist and also a great cast.Going into this movie I thought it would be really scary and I would possibly get nightmares from it,but it certainly wasn't,I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be or not,but a lot of this movie was really funny,and the overall story of the film was a lot of fun to watch as well.I really enjoyed Courteney Cox's performance as Gale Weathers,it was very different than anything else I've seen her in,and it actually took me awhile to realize it was her,I also really liked Matthew Lillard's performance.Fans of really scary horror movies will be disappointed,but people who don't like them too scary,a like a bit of comic relief should enjoy this. As a killer in a mask begins killing off teen angers,Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends use the rules and clich&eacute; of horror movies to survive.

    This movie is cool. There are violent scenes, and is denominate as a horror movie. This is a lie! This movie is sarcastic to horror genre! There is no horror and thriller! This movie is very good,gory,bloody,sexy,smart... From the same director of Nightmare on Elm Street. This is really a horror movie. This movie is fun! Exciting! With a teenager named Drew Barrymore! But is spoiler,so,i'll not tell. Enjoy Scream! He's a very good movie! There's Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4, also directed by Wes Craven. Enjoy this movie. Is a smart, and delicious movie. Starring: Neve Campbell. I watched this movie past year, my friend said that this is a very frightening horror movie. I believed. But when I saw, I wet my pants because I this is very funny. There's no spoilers in my review, but if you think that is, write a review. Because i'll know who thinks that I'm a jerk to write spoilers. Enjoy the movie!

    This is one of the slasher movies that made me start to like them as this one is an excellent slasher/horror movie takeoff as there are scares and laughs abroad. The characters are fun to watch and very enjoyable as it is one of the better crews in a horror movie. The gore level is really high as it is impressive early and a little silly later, but fun to watch at times anyway. The script is well done with its jokes and gags with the one thing surprisingly impressing to me was the phone voice. Hidden tones have been used before to hide voices, but I liked this one a lot as it is not as deep as the other one which is used almost everywhere today and the sound gives you chills as it is not mean sounding but has a different kind of tone which gave me chills. They both disguised the villain well but not well either. I guessed right, but was not ready for the other surprise. This is an excellent horror film. This is Wes Craven's passion.

    I don't understand why so many sequels were made to this movie. It was kinda boring. The opening scene was really good, so I expected the rest to be just as good. But it sadly wasn't. They should have killed off Gale ( Courtney Cox ), Or Dewey ( David Arquette ) in this movie. Now, there are rumors of a Scream 5, and Cox and Arquette are still alive with Neve Campbell! This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears. Probably suitable for 13+. Some people may enjoy this film, but it honestly bored me.

    Seventeen years passed since "Scream" was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like "Prom Night", among others. It's important to remember that even thought "Scream" criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change to way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legend". One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great "Scary Movie" franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit "Scream" feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.

When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre. When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that. (Minor spoilers about the killer(s), no identity/identities are shared) While some argue that the killer(s)'s reason of recreating horror films (although another reason is that he/she/they are just crazy) is very unlikely, I honestly believe it was the only ending the film could have done. I mean, if it turned out to be some crazy act of revenge, or another standard slasher ending, I think we'd all feel a little cheated. And this is hardly the most ridiculous ending in the franchise (as much as I enjoy SCREAM 2, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and 3 and 4 are both some of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, though I'll save that for my future reviews of those films). All in all, SCREAM is a very fun, scary, and interesting horror film that actually brought something new to a genre that had been reduced to formulaic slashers for years (if only we could have another truly original film nowadays). There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years). Highly recommended.

    Scream is a great movie with a really clever storyline,with a good twist and also a great cast.Going into this movie I thought it would be really scary and I would possibly get nightmares from it,but it certainly wasn't,I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be or not,but a lot of this movie was really funny,and the overall story of the film was a lot of fun to watch as well.I really enjoyed Courteney Cox's performance as Gale Weathers,it was very different than anything else I've seen her in,and it actually took me awhile to realize it was her,I also really liked Matthew Lillard's performance.Fans of really scary horror movies will be disappointed,but people who don't like them too scary,a like a bit of comic relief should enjoy this. As a killer in a mask begins killing off teen angers,Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends use the rules and clich&eacute; of horror movies to survive.

    This movie is cool. There are violent scenes, and is denominate as a horror movie. This is a lie! This movie is sarcastic to horror genre! There is no horror and thriller! This movie is very good,gory,bloody,sexy,smart... From the same director of Nightmare on Elm Street. This is really a horror movie. This movie is fun! Exciting! With a teenager named Drew Barrymore! But is spoiler,so,i'll not tell. Enjoy Scream! He's a very good movie! There's Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4, also directed by Wes Craven. Enjoy this movie. Is a smart, and delicious movie. Starring: Neve Campbell. I watched this movie past year, my friend said that this is a very frightening horror movie. I believed. But when I saw, I wet my pants because I this is very funny. There's no spoilers in my review, but if you think that is, write a review. Because i'll know who thinks that I'm a jerk to write spoilers. Enjoy the movie!

    This is one of the slasher movies that made me start to like them as this one is an excellent slasher/horror movie takeoff as there are scares and laughs abroad. The characters are fun to watch and very enjoyable as it is one of the better crews in a horror movie. The gore level is really high as it is impressive early and a little silly later, but fun to watch at times anyway. The script is well done with its jokes and gags with the one thing surprisingly impressing to me was the phone voice. Hidden tones have been used before to hide voices, but I liked this one a lot as it is not as deep as the other one which is used almost everywhere today and the sound gives you chills as it is not mean sounding but has a different kind of tone which gave me chills. They both disguised the villain well but not well either. I guessed right, but was not ready for the other surprise. This is an excellent horror film. This is Wes Craven's passion.

    I don't understand why so many sequels were made to this movie. It was kinda boring. The opening scene was really good, so I expected the rest to be just as good. But it sadly wasn't. They should have killed off Gale ( Courtney Cox ), Or Dewey ( David Arquette ) in this movie. Now, there are rumors of a Scream 5, and Cox and Arquette are still alive with Neve Campbell! This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears. Probably suitable for 13+. Some people may enjoy this film, but it honestly bored me.

    Seventeen years passed since "Scream" was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like "Prom Night", among others. It's important to remember that even thought "Scream" criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change to way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Urban Legend". One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great "Scary Movie" franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit "Scream" feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.

    Had 'Scream' not come along, we might never have learned the formula to slasher flicks like 'Friday the 13th'. Other newsflashes include: the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels weren't very good, Jamie Lee Curtis made quite a few horror movies, and if people wander outside in these sort of films they usually don't come back. It is, in short, an irritating and self-congratulatory film, lacking the smarts and creativity to subvert the clich&eacute;s it feeds upon; they're talked about but nothing clever is done with them. This is no 'Cabin in the Woods' and Kevin Williamson is no Joss Whedon. Williamson's reign of ironic smuggery began with, and is summed up by, this tedious slasher, and I don't know what Wes Craven's so pleased about, as he covered similar ground with his 'New Nightmare'. Undeniably influential  but not in a good way.

    Wes Craven's Scream is a brilliant slasher film that not only satirizes the genre in which it is based on, but also provides plenty of its own thrills and chills. Our main heroine of the story is Sidney Prescott, a very flawed and likable character who tries to go through life dealing with the insulting media. She hangs out with her friends who all have distinct personalities, and finds solace in their company. Unfortunately, when two teens are brutally murdered, Sidney finds that the insidious plot is focused on her, and she soon realizes that her life is starting to become one great big horror movie, and she's the star. Scream took all of the clich&eacute;s and horror movie tropes found in the slasher genre (created from being milked to death), and used them to its advantage. It makes fun of all the tired repetitive mechanics that viewers are sick of. The film is also very self-aware, constantly referencing other horror movies, directors, celebrities, quotes, rules, and scenes. It's a real treat for all the horror fans out there. A lot of the humour is found in these references, but it's also created by the excellent cast of characters who are superbly acted. Everyone in this movie is likable, and if they're not, they become likable in their own way. The viewer really starts to care if these teens bite the dust; all of this is thanks to their individual personalities and dialogue, and a new and intimidating villain with an awesome voice, who eventually became a horror icon. Scream isn't just a satire though; it's its own horror thriller, packing enough gore and killing to make its way into the top list of slasher films. On a side note, the music score is wonderful to listen to, and the cinematography is also great. You don't really point it out in horror movies but there are a few scenes in here that are breathtaking to watch on Blu-Ray, such as the shot with Sidney standing on her back-porch overlooking the mountains and sunset. Wes Craven's Scream is an amazing addition to the slasher and mystery subgenres. It has become one of my favourite films over the years and I've watched it many, many times. It's a film I'll always have fond memories of, and I feel that all horror fans, and people getting into the genre, should definitely check it out.

    Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up "Sliced and Diced" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of "It's him"...."no no, He's the killer" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)

    Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although "Scream" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be. There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in "Scream", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life. Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make "Scream" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. *Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading! Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history. Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives "Scream" its signature style. If you haven't seen "Scream" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting! Plot: 8.5/10 Acting: 8/10 Cinematography: 6.5/10 Script: 7.5/10 Style/Originality: 9/10 Overall: 7.9/10

    *Very minor spoilers, and the minor ones are given a warning* "Several more local teens are dead, bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the masked killings that has terrified this peaceful community like the plot of some scary movie. It all began with the scream over 911, and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro. All played out here in this peaceful farmhouse, far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities that its residents have fled." In a time where Michael was boring, Freddy had lost his edge, and Jason hadn't had a good film in years, the horror genre was close to dead. And yet in that time, we get SCREAM (1996), a funny, new, and, most importantly, scary movie. For once, a horror film in which the characters had seen all the same movies we had. The film opens at the house of character Casey, played by the famous Drew Barrymore, who is getting ready to sit down and watch HALLOWEEN (1978), when she receives a mysterious call. The rest of the film is littered with comedic moments and horror references that any slasher fan should have a fun time identifying (keep an eye out for the name of Sidney's boyfriend, the number on Tatum's shirt, etc). And of course there is the famous line "There are certain RULES that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie." The film mentions rules which we have all learned by watching earlier slashers. There's the glaringly obvious "don't have sex", don't yell out "who's there?", don't drink, and more. And what SCREAM does is try to break every rule (though it is still rather unpredictable). Now, of course, I hate what SCREAM did to the genre. It revived the horror genre, and specifically the slasher sub-genre, but almost all of the films inspired by SCREAM were just annoying and cheesy films that were trying too hard to be self-aware and hip. Looking at you, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997) (it's hard to believe that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was written by the same writer of SCREAM). And, while the second SCREAM movie is still pretty good, the other two films in the franchise are horrible imitations, just as formulaic as the films SCREAM tried to defy. When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre. When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that.

There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years).

Unfortunately, when two teens are brutally murdered, Sidney finds that the insidious plot is focused on her, and she soon realizes that her life is starting to become one great big horror movie, and she's the star. Scream took all of the clich&eacute;s and horror movie tropes found in the slasher genre (created from being milked to death), and used them to its advantage. It makes fun of all the tired repetitive mechanics that viewers are sick of. The film is also very self-aware, constantly referencing other horror movies, directors, celebrities, quotes, rules, and scenes. It's a real treat for all the horror fans out there. A lot of the humour is found in these references, but it's also created by the excellent cast of characters who are superbly acted. Everyone in this movie is likable, and if they're not, they become likable in their own way. The viewer really starts to care if these teens bite the dust; all of this is thanks to their individual personalities and dialogue, and a new and intimidating villain with an awesome voice, who eventually became a horror icon. Scream isn't just a satire though; it's its own horror thriller, packing enough gore and killing to make its way into the top list of slasher films. On a side note, the music score is wonderful to listen to, and the cinematography is also great. You don't really point it out in horror movies but there are a few scenes in here that are breathtaking to watch on Blu-Ray, such as the shot with Sidney standing on her back-porch overlooking the mountains and sunset. Wes Craven's Scream is an amazing addition to the slasher and mystery subgenres. It has become one of my favourite films over the years and I've watched it many, many times. It's a film I'll always have fond memories of, and I feel that all horror fans, and people getting into the genre, should definitely check it out.

    Re-invention of the Classic Slasher? Yes indeedy. Back in the 90's, just when you thought the horror genre had limped away with the odd entrails popping up here there and everywhere, up jumps this little gem and BOOOOOOOM, hundreds more jump on the bandwagon for a bloodthirsty, gut spilling ride. Drew Barrymore's role was cleverly placed as top billing (if I remember correctly she was all over the Cinema posters and adverts etc etc) and ended up "Sliced and Diced" within the first 10 min of the film.......Awesome casting. Neve (that's Nev not Neeeeeeeeev) Campbell plays a virginal high school girl Sydney Prescott, mentally scarred by her mothers tragic murder who doesn't give it up for her Depp looky-likey Boyf Skeet Ulrich. She's the main target through out the film and plenty of "It's him"...."no no, He's the killer" ensues. Scream doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what I love about this film. Jamie Kennedy's Randy is utter genius, esp the Rules of survival.....so so true to the classic low budget slasher! There's not one character in this film that doesn't belong and even Rose McGowen's Tatum (who, I'm sorry, could probably have someones eye out with those things!) is a good compliment to the meek and mild Sydney. There's plenty of tense moments with one of my favourites (The killers at large, Sydney's at her house waiting for Tatum. She opens a door, music builds up for a climax, she closes it and there's nothing there). I was told that Scream was one of the first movies to adopt that red herring...not sure if that's true, but it's very good and have seen it in lots of other movies since. A healthier looking Courtney Cox is a refreshing change to the emaciated botoxed bore she's now become and it's interesting to see the sparks fly between her and David Arquette. As for Matthew Lillard.....he's my dirty little love secret so there will be no bad reviews from me (yes yes that goes for Scooby Doo too!!!)

    Original, enticing, thrilling, and most of all completely realistic. What makes this movie truly capture the audience is the fact that it could actually happen in real life. Although "Scream" is not based on a true story, it sure seems like it could be. There are many aspects of film that are executed perfectly in "Scream", but its strongest is the plot. The story draws you in keeps you guessing and makes you ask the same two questions: Who is the killer? and What's going to happen next? Also, the cast exudes tremendous chemistry that really brings the story to life. Neve Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist, Sidney Prescott, who is being stalked and threatened by the killer the entire movie. I wouldn't say her performance is great, but she definitely does a commendable job. Courtney Cox is excellent as the bitchy, determined reporter, Gale Weathers, who still believes the wrong person was accused of committing the murder of Sidney's mother. David Arquette does well as goofy, incompetent Deputy Dewey. Rose Mcgowan also does well in her as Tatum, Sidney's slutty best friend. Jamie Kennedy really shines as Randy , a horror movie buff whose outrageous theories and rules on horror stories play a major role in the element of mystery that the film builds on from the notorious opening scene, featuring Drew Barrymore, to the ending credits. Kennedy also adds crucial comic relief. The entire ensemble gives above average performances. However, the two actors that really stand out and make "Scream" what it is are commonly overlooked: Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. *Below contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading! Ulrich plays Billy, Sidney's boyfriend who is one of the main suspects of being the killer. His mysterious, yet comforting performance throughout most of the movie keeps you going back and forth on whether he actually is the killer or not. The moment he is revealed as the killer, his character immediately changes and takes you into the mindset of a killer. His sinister performance in the last 20 minutes of the movie is underrated and definitely deserves more credit. Alongside him as the other killer (which for me came out of nowhere) is Matthew Lillard's character, Stu, whose comical and eccentric demeanor surprisingly complements Billy's ruthlessness. Although Stu doesn't really have a motive for committing all of the murders, he solidifies himself and Billy as two of the most original villains in horror movie history. Also, the voice of the killer(complements of Roger Jackson) gives "Scream" its signature style. If you haven't seen "Scream" I highly recommend you check it out. And if you have seen it, watch it again as the second viewing is just as riveting! Plot: 8.5/10 Acting: 8/10 Cinematography: 6.5/10 Script: 7.5/10 Style/Originality: 9/10 Overall: 7.9/10

    *Very minor spoilers, and the minor ones are given a warning* "Several more local teens are dead, bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the masked killings that has terrified this peaceful community like the plot of some scary movie. It all began with the scream over 911, and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro. All played out here in this peaceful farmhouse, far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities that its residents have fled." In a time where Michael was boring, Freddy had lost his edge, and Jason hadn't had a good film in years, the horror genre was close to dead. And yet in that time, we get SCREAM (1996), a funny, new, and, most importantly, scary movie. For once, a horror film in which the characters had seen all the same movies we had. The film opens at the house of character Casey, played by the famous Drew Barrymore, who is getting ready to sit down and watch HALLOWEEN (1978), when she receives a mysterious call. The rest of the film is littered with comedic moments and horror references that any slasher fan should have a fun time identifying (keep an eye out for the name of Sidney's boyfriend, the number on Tatum's shirt, etc). And of course there is the famous line "There are certain RULES that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie." The film mentions rules which we have all learned by watching earlier slashers. There's the glaringly obvious "don't have sex", don't yell out "who's there?", don't drink, and more. And what SCREAM does is try to break every rule (though it is still rather unpredictable). Now, of course, I hate what SCREAM did to the genre. It revived the horror genre, and specifically the slasher sub-genre, but almost all of the films inspired by SCREAM were just annoying and cheesy films that were trying too hard to be self-aware and hip. Looking at you, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997) (it's hard to believe that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was written by the same writer of SCREAM). And, while the second SCREAM movie is still pretty good, the other two films in the franchise are horrible imitations, just as formulaic as the films SCREAM tried to defy. When I first got in to horror, I watched almost every sub-genre of horror films, and had seen quite a lot of movies at young age (by the time I was 13 I had already seen THE SHINING (1980), THE EXORCIST (1973), THE OMEN (1976), THE FLY (1986) and many, many more), but one sub-genre that I wasn't very experienced in was the slasher. Sure, I had seen HALLOWEEN and the first four Friday THE 13TH films by the time of watching this, but that's as deep as my understanding of the sub-genre went. So I enjoy SCREAM because it helped past-me and many other horror novices discover the slasher genre (this film led me to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise, PROM NIGHT, THE BURNING, and many others that I never had any interest in watching before). And that is what I truly love about SCREAM: its ability to please horror experts and to educate those who aren't as understanding of the genre. When some horror fans want to talk about awful modern movies, their go- to film to poke fun at is often SCREAM. I find this completely ridiculous, because SCREAM is actually a very good film. I'd understand completely if they made fun of SCREAM 3 (2000) or SCREAM 4 (2011), or hey, I could even understand SCREAM 2, but the original SCREAM is actually a very original, witty, tongue-in-cheek film that still somehow manages to scare on top of all of that. (Minor spoilers about the killer(s), no identity/identities are shared) While some argue that the killer(s)'s reason of recreating horror films (although another reason is that he/she/they are just crazy) is very unlikely, I honestly believe it was the only ending the film could have done. I mean, if it turned out to be some crazy act of revenge, or another standard slasher ending, I think we'd all feel a little cheated. And this is hardly the most ridiculous ending in the franchise (as much as I enjoy SCREAM 2, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and 3 and 4 are both some of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, though I'll save that for my future reviews of those films). All in all, SCREAM is a very fun, scary, and interesting horror film that actually brought something new to a genre that had been reduced to formulaic slashers for years (if only we could have another truly original film nowadays). There are some brilliant one-liners ("You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick"), great characters (I'm not Dewey's biggest fan, but besides him I enjoy all of the characters), and a mystery-slasher that actually keeps you constantly guessing until the very end (the first time I watched this film, I never would have guessed the killer(s) in a million years). Highly recommended.

    Scream is a great movie with a really clever storyline,with a good twist and also a great cast.Going into this movie I thought it would be really scary and I would possibly get nightmares from it,but it certainly wasn't,I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be or not,but a lot of this movie was really funny,and the overall story of the film was a lot of fun to watch as well.I really enjoyed Courteney Cox's performance as Gale Weathers,it was very different than anything else I've seen her in,and it actually took me awhile to realize it was her,I also really liked Matthew Lillard's performance.Fans of really scary horror movies will be disappointed,but people who don't like them too scary,a like a bit of comic relief should enjoy this. As a killer in a mask begins killing off teen angers,Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends use the rules and clich&eacute; of horror movies to survive.

    This movie is cool. There are violent scenes, and is denominate as a horror movie. This is a lie! This movie is sarcastic to horror genre! There is no horror and thriller! This movie is very good,gory,bloody,sexy,smart... From the same director of Nightmare on Elm Street. This is really a horror movie. This movie is fun! Exciting! With a teenager named Drew Barrymore! But is spoiler,so,i'll not tell. Enjoy Scream! He's a very good movie! There's Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4, also directed by Wes Craven. Enjoy this movie. Is a smart, and delicious movie. Starring: Neve Campbell. I watched this movie past year, my friend said that this is a very frightening horror movie. I believed. But when I saw, I wet my pants because I this is very funny. There's no spoilers in my review, but if you think that is, write a review. Because i'll know who thinks that I'm a jerk to write spoilers. Enjoy the movie!

    This is one of the slasher movies that made me start to like them as this one is an excellent slasher/horror movie takeoff as there are scares and laughs abroad. The characters are fun to watch and very enjoyable as it is one of the better crews in a horror movie. The gore level is really high as it is impressive early and a little silly later, but fun to watch at times anyway. The script is well done with its jokes and gags with the one thing surprisingly impressing to me was the phone voice. Hidden tones have been used before to hide voices, but I liked this one a lot as it is not as deep as the other one which is used almost everywhere today and the sound gives you chills as it is not mean sounding but has a different kind of tone which gave me chills. They both disguised the villain well but not well either. I guessed right, but was not ready for the other surprise. This is an excellent horror film. This is Wes Craven's passion.

    I don't understand why so many sequels were made to this movie. It was kinda boring. The opening scene was really good, so I expected the rest to be just as good. But it sadly wasn't. They should have killed off Gale ( Courtney Cox ), Or Dewey ( David Arquette ) in this movie. Now, there are rumors of a Scream 5, and Cox and Arquette are still alive with Neve Campbell! This movie is rated R. There are a few F bombs and other language that children don't need to hear. There is bloody and gory violence throughout the film. A girl does take off her clothes as she gets in the shower, no nudity is shown. Some mild terror when Ghostface appears. Probably suitable for 13+. Some people may enjoy this film, but it honestly bored me.
