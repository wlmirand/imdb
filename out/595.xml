    To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The "fading salesman with problems" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" or Shelley Levene in "Glengarry Glen Ross." I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay. De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in "Cape Fear." De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the "what have you done for me lately" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to "help" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell. Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit. The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)

    DeNiro gives an okay, but one-note performance as a dedicated baseball fan who, as a result of his fixation on Bobby Rayburn (#11), loses his job and family. Other than to show that he has a bad temper, I don't see how they are relevant to the movie. I think too much time is spent on the scenes at home, on the job, and on the baseball game itself. And DeNiro's acting just didn't seem genuine at all. In most movies about people who go from obsessing to stalking, this line is crossed at about halfway through the movie. But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more. ** out of ****

    Gil Renard is obsessed with baseball. Because he is from San Francisco he is a fan of the Giants, by the beginning of the season the Giants have signed all-star centre-fielder Bobby Rayburn to a 40 Million dollar contract. But, things do not go well for both Gil and Rayburn. Rayburn is slumping and Gil loses his job and eventually his wife and son. Gil goes deeper into his obsession with Rayburn and takes matters into his own hands. He believes that Rayburn is slumping because of another Giants player named Juan Primo who is playing well. Gil secretly helps him out. But when Gil feels that Rayburn is ungrateful, Gil kidnaps his son. Now, Rayburn must perform at his best at the last game of the season in order to save his son... I don't know why, but I have a lot of love for this movie. It's not perfect by any means, and Scott has really gone to town on the editing here, but everyone has a film that they love that was critically mauled. De Niro is at this archetypal best here as Gil, a paint by the numbers psycho, who isn't spontaneous, but predictable, and still very creepy. Snipes proves in this that the mid nineties were the best for his career, as he puts in another great performance, and during the final third, really shows depth and emotion. There is great support from Leguizamo and Barkin, and the film is made slickly with a brilliant soundtrack, but if you look closer, there are lots of faults in this. It's one of those rare occasions with a movie that I really don't care about the faults or the plot holes or the blatant use of stunt doubles. The eighteen year old in me is still calling for the flashy editing, silly use of knives and De Niro in full psycho mode, and I still love it.

    Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas," and "Cape Fear." In "Top Gun" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller "The Fan," De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of "White Men Can't Jump"), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin). The plot of "The Fan" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of "License to Kill") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel "The Fan" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. "The Fan" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.

    Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.

    ***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball. Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations. It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth! ***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was. The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.

    The Fan is about a baseball player who becomes the unhealthy focus on a salesman who is down on his luck. Seeing the rating, I became very interested in seeing this movie. Now I have seen it, and I am glad that I saw it. Why? I'll tell you why. In my honest to goodness point of view, The Fan is a tense and exciting drama thriller that is a very entertaining movie! Another thing that really wanted me to see this movie is the fact that it stars Robert De Niro, who happens to be one of my all time favorite actors. Now getting back to my review, this movie was a very good movie, it was fun, exciting, intense, and at certain times, very suspenseful. The Fan now has to be one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated Robert De Niro movies that I have ever seen, because I think that the rating in the 5's is rather low for this good movie, a rating in the 6's would be more appropriate. But anyway, I am not letting the rating affect my judgement, this movie is a very good movie, it is a very fun time! As he is in a lot of the movies that I have seen him in, Robert De Niro is excellent. He plays Gil Renard, a salesmen who takes an unhealthy liking for a professional baseball player named Bobby Rayburn, played by Wesley Snipes. No matter what movie he is in, and no matter what role he plays, Robert De Niro never fails to amuse me with his absolutely incredible acting skills. Even if the movie that he stars in isn't that good, he still manages to do an excellent job. I haven't seen a bad Robert De Niro movie yet, there are something that I like more than others, but I can't say that I have seen one that I absolutely hated. So all in all, Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors who has ever lived. I send my congratulations to Robert De Niro for making yet another movie that I totally and completely enjoyed. Well all in all, The Fan is a very underrated movie, no wait, it is a criminally underrated movie. You've got to see this movie if you haven't already, because you will probably enjoy it. While I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of a movie, I nevertheless find it to be a very entertaining and delightful experience! Even if you don't necessarily care for the movie, you probably will like Robert De Niro's performance. Well all in all, this movie is a very entertaining delight, watch it if you haven't seen it already, you will most likely end up really enjoying it! I love Robert De Niro, and I really enjoyed this movie, don't miss out on it. 10/10

    The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league. I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song "Closer" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film). On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old "mentor" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending. Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did.

    One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich&eacute; of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies

    The Fan has combined both baseball and a thriller together to make everyone happy. It is slow at the beginning but it gets interesting as the story develops more and more as we look at the life of a famous player and a knife salesman who will later become involved in a life risking dilemma. Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clich&eacute;d and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you. The violence is limited and that's is a good thing but language is high. (MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!)Number one fan Gil Renard whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder Booby Rayburn. While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey. When Primo brushes off the fan's concerns, Gil proceeds to murder the left fielder with one of his makeshift knives! Wesley Snipes finally gives a exceptional performance and he plays his sport role, Bobby Rayburne, very well and he shows emotion along with many other good feelings. The Fan is not so great that you would rather watch this than Kill Bill because you are a complete retard (No Offense). Robert De Niro plays the die-hard baseball fan who will do anything to impress his favorite baseball player, Bobby Rayburne (Wesley Snipes, and which results in him turning into something sinister and evil. Benicio Del Toro is almost unrecognizable in this film but after catching his face a few times, I finally realized that Benicio Del Toro looks like crap in this film. Jack Black also makes a two-second appearance in this film as the radio station guy. He looks normal and fat, usual. I got this in a triple film-pack which contained Money Train and Unstoppable, so I brought it because it was a good deal. This film deserves a view at least once. It is enjoyable, entertaining, fun, clich&eacute;d and flawed but even though it is all that, you will have a good time. 7/10.

    To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The "fading salesman with problems" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" or Shelley Levene in "Glengarry Glen Ross." I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay. De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in "Cape Fear." De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the "what have you done for me lately" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to "help" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell. Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit. The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)

    DeNiro gives an okay, but one-note performance as a dedicated baseball fan who, as a result of his fixation on Bobby Rayburn (#11), loses his job and family. Other than to show that he has a bad temper, I don't see how they are relevant to the movie. I think too much time is spent on the scenes at home, on the job, and on the baseball game itself. And DeNiro's acting just didn't seem genuine at all. In most movies about people who go from obsessing to stalking, this line is crossed at about halfway through the movie. But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more. ** out of ****

    Gil Renard is obsessed with baseball. Because he is from San Francisco he is a fan of the Giants, by the beginning of the season the Giants have signed all-star centre-fielder Bobby Rayburn to a 40 Million dollar contract. But, things do not go well for both Gil and Rayburn. Rayburn is slumping and Gil loses his job and eventually his wife and son. Gil goes deeper into his obsession with Rayburn and takes matters into his own hands. He believes that Rayburn is slumping because of another Giants player named Juan Primo who is playing well. Gil secretly helps him out. But when Gil feels that Rayburn is ungrateful, Gil kidnaps his son. Now, Rayburn must perform at his best at the last game of the season in order to save his son... I don't know why, but I have a lot of love for this movie. It's not perfect by any means, and Scott has really gone to town on the editing here, but everyone has a film that they love that was critically mauled. De Niro is at this archetypal best here as Gil, a paint by the numbers psycho, who isn't spontaneous, but predictable, and still very creepy. Snipes proves in this that the mid nineties were the best for his career, as he puts in another great performance, and during the final third, really shows depth and emotion. There is great support from Leguizamo and Barkin, and the film is made slickly with a brilliant soundtrack, but if you look closer, there are lots of faults in this. It's one of those rare occasions with a movie that I really don't care about the faults or the plot holes or the blatant use of stunt doubles. The eighteen year old in me is still calling for the flashy editing, silly use of knives and De Niro in full psycho mode, and I still love it.

    Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas," and "Cape Fear." In "Top Gun" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller "The Fan," De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of "White Men Can't Jump"), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin). The plot of "The Fan" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of "License to Kill") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel "The Fan" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. "The Fan" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.

    Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.

    ***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball. Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations. It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth! ***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was. The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.

    The Fan is about a baseball player who becomes the unhealthy focus on a salesman who is down on his luck. Seeing the rating, I became very interested in seeing this movie. Now I have seen it, and I am glad that I saw it. Why? I'll tell you why. In my honest to goodness point of view, The Fan is a tense and exciting drama thriller that is a very entertaining movie! Another thing that really wanted me to see this movie is the fact that it stars Robert De Niro, who happens to be one of my all time favorite actors. Now getting back to my review, this movie was a very good movie, it was fun, exciting, intense, and at certain times, very suspenseful. The Fan now has to be one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated Robert De Niro movies that I have ever seen, because I think that the rating in the 5's is rather low for this good movie, a rating in the 6's would be more appropriate. But anyway, I am not letting the rating affect my judgement, this movie is a very good movie, it is a very fun time! As he is in a lot of the movies that I have seen him in, Robert De Niro is excellent. He plays Gil Renard, a salesmen who takes an unhealthy liking for a professional baseball player named Bobby Rayburn, played by Wesley Snipes. No matter what movie he is in, and no matter what role he plays, Robert De Niro never fails to amuse me with his absolutely incredible acting skills. Even if the movie that he stars in isn't that good, he still manages to do an excellent job. I haven't seen a bad Robert De Niro movie yet, there are something that I like more than others, but I can't say that I have seen one that I absolutely hated. So all in all, Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors who has ever lived. I send my congratulations to Robert De Niro for making yet another movie that I totally and completely enjoyed. Well all in all, The Fan is a very underrated movie, no wait, it is a criminally underrated movie. You've got to see this movie if you haven't already, because you will probably enjoy it. While I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of a movie, I nevertheless find it to be a very entertaining and delightful experience! Even if you don't necessarily care for the movie, you probably will like Robert De Niro's performance. Well all in all, this movie is a very entertaining delight, watch it if you haven't seen it already, you will most likely end up really enjoying it! I love Robert De Niro, and I really enjoyed this movie, don't miss out on it. 10/10

    The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league. I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song "Closer" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film). On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old "mentor" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending. Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did.

    One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich&eacute; of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies

    The Fan has combined both baseball and a thriller together to make everyone happy. It is slow at the beginning but it gets interesting as the story develops more and more as we look at the life of a famous player and a knife salesman who will later become involved in a life risking dilemma. Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clich&eacute;d and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you. The violence is limited and that's is a good thing but language is high. (MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!)Number one fan Gil Renard whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder Booby Rayburn. While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey. When Primo brushes off the fan's concerns, Gil proceeds to murder the left fielder with one of his makeshift knives! Wesley Snipes finally gives a exceptional performance and he plays his sport role, Bobby Rayburne, very well and he shows emotion along with many other good feelings. The Fan is not so great that you would rather watch this than Kill Bill because you are a complete retard (No Offense). Robert De Niro plays the die-hard baseball fan who will do anything to impress his favorite baseball player, Bobby Rayburne (Wesley Snipes, and which results in him turning into something sinister and evil. Benicio Del Toro is almost unrecognizable in this film but after catching his face a few times, I finally realized that Benicio Del Toro looks like crap in this film. Jack Black also makes a two-second appearance in this film as the radio station guy. He looks normal and fat, usual. I got this in a triple film-pack which contained Money Train and Unstoppable, so I brought it because it was a good deal. This film deserves a view at least once. It is enjoyable, entertaining, fun, clich&eacute;d and flawed but even though it is all that, you will have a good time. 7/10.

    To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The "fading salesman with problems" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" or Shelley Levene in "Glengarry Glen Ross." I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay. De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in "Cape Fear." De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the "what have you done for me lately" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to "help" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell. Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit. The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)

But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more. ** out of ****

But, things do not go well for both Gil and Rayburn. Rayburn is slumping and Gil loses his job and eventually his wife and son. Gil goes deeper into his obsession with Rayburn and takes matters into his own hands. He believes that Rayburn is slumping because of another Giants player named Juan Primo who is playing well.

It's not perfect by any means, and Scott has really gone to town on the editing here, but everyone has a film that they love that was critically mauled.

    Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas," and "Cape Fear." In "Top Gun" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller "The Fan," De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of "White Men Can't Jump"), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin). The plot of "The Fan" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of "License to Kill") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel "The Fan" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. "The Fan" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.

    Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.

    ***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball. Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations. It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth! ***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was. The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.

    The Fan is about a baseball player who becomes the unhealthy focus on a salesman who is down on his luck. Seeing the rating, I became very interested in seeing this movie. Now I have seen it, and I am glad that I saw it. Why? I'll tell you why. In my honest to goodness point of view, The Fan is a tense and exciting drama thriller that is a very entertaining movie! Another thing that really wanted me to see this movie is the fact that it stars Robert De Niro, who happens to be one of my all time favorite actors. Now getting back to my review, this movie was a very good movie, it was fun, exciting, intense, and at certain times, very suspenseful. The Fan now has to be one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated Robert De Niro movies that I have ever seen, because I think that the rating in the 5's is rather low for this good movie, a rating in the 6's would be more appropriate. But anyway, I am not letting the rating affect my judgement, this movie is a very good movie, it is a very fun time! As he is in a lot of the movies that I have seen him in, Robert De Niro is excellent. He plays Gil Renard, a salesmen who takes an unhealthy liking for a professional baseball player named Bobby Rayburn, played by Wesley Snipes. No matter what movie he is in, and no matter what role he plays, Robert De Niro never fails to amuse me with his absolutely incredible acting skills. Even if the movie that he stars in isn't that good, he still manages to do an excellent job. I haven't seen a bad Robert De Niro movie yet, there are something that I like more than others, but I can't say that I have seen one that I absolutely hated. So all in all, Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors who has ever lived. I send my congratulations to Robert De Niro for making yet another movie that I totally and completely enjoyed. Well all in all, The Fan is a very underrated movie, no wait, it is a criminally underrated movie. You've got to see this movie if you haven't already, because you will probably enjoy it. While I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of a movie, I nevertheless find it to be a very entertaining and delightful experience! Even if you don't necessarily care for the movie, you probably will like Robert De Niro's performance. Well all in all, this movie is a very entertaining delight, watch it if you haven't seen it already, you will most likely end up really enjoying it! I love Robert De Niro, and I really enjoyed this movie, don't miss out on it. 10/10

    The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league. I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song "Closer" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film). On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old "mentor" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending. Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did.

    One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich&eacute; of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies

    The Fan has combined both baseball and a thriller together to make everyone happy. It is slow at the beginning but it gets interesting as the story develops more and more as we look at the life of a famous player and a knife salesman who will later become involved in a life risking dilemma. Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clich&eacute;d and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you. The violence is limited and that's is a good thing but language is high. (MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!)Number one fan Gil Renard whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder Booby Rayburn. While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey. When Primo brushes off the fan's concerns, Gil proceeds to murder the left fielder with one of his makeshift knives! Wesley Snipes finally gives a exceptional performance and he plays his sport role, Bobby Rayburne, very well and he shows emotion along with many other good feelings. The Fan is not so great that you would rather watch this than Kill Bill because you are a complete retard (No Offense). Robert De Niro plays the die-hard baseball fan who will do anything to impress his favorite baseball player, Bobby Rayburne (Wesley Snipes, and which results in him turning into something sinister and evil. Benicio Del Toro is almost unrecognizable in this film but after catching his face a few times, I finally realized that Benicio Del Toro looks like crap in this film. Jack Black also makes a two-second appearance in this film as the radio station guy. He looks normal and fat, usual. I got this in a triple film-pack which contained Money Train and Unstoppable, so I brought it because it was a good deal. This film deserves a view at least once. It is enjoyable, entertaining, fun, clich&eacute;d and flawed but even though it is all that, you will have a good time. 7/10.

    To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The "fading salesman with problems" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" or Shelley Levene in "Glengarry Glen Ross." I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay. De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in "Cape Fear." De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the "what have you done for me lately" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to "help" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell. Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit. The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)

    DeNiro gives an okay, but one-note performance as a dedicated baseball fan who, as a result of his fixation on Bobby Rayburn (#11), loses his job and family. Other than to show that he has a bad temper, I don't see how they are relevant to the movie. I think too much time is spent on the scenes at home, on the job, and on the baseball game itself. And DeNiro's acting just didn't seem genuine at all. In most movies about people who go from obsessing to stalking, this line is crossed at about halfway through the movie. But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more. ** out of ****

    Gil Renard is obsessed with baseball. Because he is from San Francisco he is a fan of the Giants, by the beginning of the season the Giants have signed all-star centre-fielder Bobby Rayburn to a 40 Million dollar contract. But, things do not go well for both Gil and Rayburn. Rayburn is slumping and Gil loses his job and eventually his wife and son. Gil goes deeper into his obsession with Rayburn and takes matters into his own hands. He believes that Rayburn is slumping because of another Giants player named Juan Primo who is playing well. Gil secretly helps him out. But when Gil feels that Rayburn is ungrateful, Gil kidnaps his son. Now, Rayburn must perform at his best at the last game of the season in order to save his son... I don't know why, but I have a lot of love for this movie. It's not perfect by any means, and Scott has really gone to town on the editing here, but everyone has a film that they love that was critically mauled. De Niro is at this archetypal best here as Gil, a paint by the numbers psycho, who isn't spontaneous, but predictable, and still very creepy. Snipes proves in this that the mid nineties were the best for his career, as he puts in another great performance, and during the final third, really shows depth and emotion. There is great support from Leguizamo and Barkin, and the film is made slickly with a brilliant soundtrack, but if you look closer, there are lots of faults in this. It's one of those rare occasions with a movie that I really don't care about the faults or the plot holes or the blatant use of stunt doubles. The eighteen year old in me is still calling for the flashy editing, silly use of knives and De Niro in full psycho mode, and I still love it.

    Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas," and "Cape Fear." In "Top Gun" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller "The Fan," De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of "White Men Can't Jump"), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin). The plot of "The Fan" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of "License to Kill") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel "The Fan" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. "The Fan" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.

The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.

    ***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball. Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations. It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball!

Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was. The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.

    The Fan is about a baseball player who becomes the unhealthy focus on a salesman who is down on his luck. Seeing the rating, I became very interested in seeing this movie. Now I have seen it, and I am glad that I saw it. Why? I'll tell you why. In my honest to goodness point of view, The Fan is a tense and exciting drama thriller that is a very entertaining movie! Another thing that really wanted me to see this movie is the fact that it stars Robert De Niro, who happens to be one of my all time favorite actors. Now getting back to my review, this movie was a very good movie, it was fun, exciting, intense, and at certain times, very suspenseful. The Fan now has to be one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated Robert De Niro movies that I have ever seen, because I think that the rating in the 5's is rather low for this good movie, a rating in the 6's would be more appropriate. But anyway, I am not letting the rating affect my judgement, this movie is a very good movie, it is a very fun time! As he is in a lot of the movies that I have seen him in, Robert De Niro is excellent. He plays Gil Renard, a salesmen who takes an unhealthy liking for a professional baseball player named Bobby Rayburn, played by Wesley Snipes. No matter what movie he is in, and no matter what role he plays, Robert De Niro never fails to amuse me with his absolutely incredible acting skills. Even if the movie that he stars in isn't that good, he still manages to do an excellent job. I haven't seen a bad Robert De Niro movie yet, there are something that I like more than others, but I can't say that I have seen one that I absolutely hated. So all in all, Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors who has ever lived. I send my congratulations to Robert De Niro for making yet another movie that I totally and completely enjoyed. Well all in all, The Fan is a very underrated movie, no wait, it is a criminally underrated movie. You've got to see this movie if you haven't already, because you will probably enjoy it. While I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of a movie, I nevertheless find it to be a very entertaining and delightful experience! Even if you don't necessarily care for the movie, you probably will like Robert De Niro's performance. Well all in all, this movie is a very entertaining delight, watch it if you haven't seen it already, you will most likely end up really enjoying it! I love Robert De Niro, and I really enjoyed this movie, don't miss out on it. 10/10

    The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league. I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song "Closer" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film). On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old "mentor" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending. Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did.

    One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich&eacute; of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies

    The Fan has combined both baseball and a thriller together to make everyone happy. It is slow at the beginning but it gets interesting as the story develops more and more as we look at the life of a famous player and a knife salesman who will later become involved in a life risking dilemma. Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clich&eacute;d and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you. The violence is limited and that's is a good thing but language is high. (MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!)Number one fan Gil Renard whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder Booby Rayburn. While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey. When Primo brushes off the fan's concerns, Gil proceeds to murder the left fielder with one of his makeshift knives! Wesley Snipes finally gives a exceptional performance and he plays his sport role, Bobby Rayburne, very well and he shows emotion along with many other good feelings. The Fan is not so great that you would rather watch this than Kill Bill because you are a complete retard (No Offense). Robert De Niro plays the die-hard baseball fan who will do anything to impress his favorite baseball player, Bobby Rayburne (Wesley Snipes, and which results in him turning into something sinister and evil. Benicio Del Toro is almost unrecognizable in this film but after catching his face a few times, I finally realized that Benicio Del Toro looks like crap in this film. Jack Black also makes a two-second appearance in this film as the radio station guy. He looks normal and fat, usual. I got this in a triple film-pack which contained Money Train and Unstoppable, so I brought it because it was a good deal. This film deserves a view at least once. It is enjoyable, entertaining, fun, clich&eacute;d and flawed but even though it is all that, you will have a good time. 7/10.

    To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The "fading salesman with problems" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" or Shelley Levene in "Glengarry Glen Ross." I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay. De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in "Cape Fear." De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the "what have you done for me lately" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to "help" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell. Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit. The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)

    DeNiro gives an okay, but one-note performance as a dedicated baseball fan who, as a result of his fixation on Bobby Rayburn (#11), loses his job and family. Other than to show that he has a bad temper, I don't see how they are relevant to the movie. I think too much time is spent on the scenes at home, on the job, and on the baseball game itself. And DeNiro's acting just didn't seem genuine at all. In most movies about people who go from obsessing to stalking, this line is crossed at about halfway through the movie. But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more. ** out of ****

    Gil Renard is obsessed with baseball. Because he is from San Francisco he is a fan of the Giants, by the beginning of the season the Giants have signed all-star centre-fielder Bobby Rayburn to a 40 Million dollar contract. But, things do not go well for both Gil and Rayburn. Rayburn is slumping and Gil loses his job and eventually his wife and son. Gil goes deeper into his obsession with Rayburn and takes matters into his own hands. He believes that Rayburn is slumping because of another Giants player named Juan Primo who is playing well. Gil secretly helps him out. But when Gil feels that Rayburn is ungrateful, Gil kidnaps his son. Now, Rayburn must perform at his best at the last game of the season in order to save his son... I don't know why, but I have a lot of love for this movie. It's not perfect by any means, and Scott has really gone to town on the editing here, but everyone has a film that they love that was critically mauled. De Niro is at this archetypal best here as Gil, a paint by the numbers psycho, who isn't spontaneous, but predictable, and still very creepy. Snipes proves in this that the mid nineties were the best for his career, as he puts in another great performance, and during the final third, really shows depth and emotion. There is great support from Leguizamo and Barkin, and the film is made slickly with a brilliant soundtrack, but if you look closer, there are lots of faults in this. It's one of those rare occasions with a movie that I really don't care about the faults or the plot holes or the blatant use of stunt doubles. The eighteen year old in me is still calling for the flashy editing, silly use of knives and De Niro in full psycho mode, and I still love it.

    Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas," and "Cape Fear." In "Top Gun" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller "The Fan," De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of "White Men Can't Jump"), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin). The plot of "The Fan" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of "License to Kill") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel "The Fan" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. "The Fan" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.

    Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.

    ***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball. Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations. It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth! ***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was. The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.

    The Fan is about a baseball player who becomes the unhealthy focus on a salesman who is down on his luck. Seeing the rating, I became very interested in seeing this movie. Now I have seen it, and I am glad that I saw it. Why? I'll tell you why. In my honest to goodness point of view, The Fan is a tense and exciting drama thriller that is a very entertaining movie! Another thing that really wanted me to see this movie is the fact that it stars Robert De Niro, who happens to be one of my all time favorite actors. Now getting back to my review, this movie was a very good movie, it was fun, exciting, intense, and at certain times, very suspenseful. The Fan now has to be one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated Robert De Niro movies that I have ever seen, because I think that the rating in the 5's is rather low for this good movie, a rating in the 6's would be more appropriate. But anyway, I am not letting the rating affect my judgement, this movie is a very good movie, it is a very fun time! As he is in a lot of the movies that I have seen him in, Robert De Niro is excellent. He plays Gil Renard, a salesmen who takes an unhealthy liking for a professional baseball player named Bobby Rayburn, played by Wesley Snipes. No matter what movie he is in, and no matter what role he plays, Robert De Niro never fails to amuse me with his absolutely incredible acting skills. Even if the movie that he stars in isn't that good, he still manages to do an excellent job. I haven't seen a bad Robert De Niro movie yet, there are something that I like more than others, but I can't say that I have seen one that I absolutely hated. So all in all, Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors who has ever lived. I send my congratulations to Robert De Niro for making yet another movie that I totally and completely enjoyed. Well all in all, The Fan is a very underrated movie, no wait, it is a criminally underrated movie. You've got to see this movie if you haven't already, because you will probably enjoy it. While I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of a movie, I nevertheless find it to be a very entertaining and delightful experience! Even if you don't necessarily care for the movie, you probably will like Robert De Niro's performance. Well all in all, this movie is a very entertaining delight, watch it if you haven't seen it already, you will most likely end up really enjoying it! I love Robert De Niro, and I really enjoyed this movie, don't miss out on it. 10/10

    The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league. I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song "Closer" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film). On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old "mentor" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending. Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did.

    One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich&eacute; of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies

    The Fan has combined both baseball and a thriller together to make everyone happy. It is slow at the beginning but it gets interesting as the story develops more and more as we look at the life of a famous player and a knife salesman who will later become involved in a life risking dilemma. Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clich&eacute;d and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you. The violence is limited and that's is a good thing but language is high. (MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!)Number one fan Gil Renard whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder Booby Rayburn. While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey. When Primo brushes off the fan's concerns, Gil proceeds to murder the left fielder with one of his makeshift knives! Wesley Snipes finally gives a exceptional performance and he plays his sport role, Bobby Rayburne, very well and he shows emotion along with many other good feelings. The Fan is not so great that you would rather watch this than Kill Bill because you are a complete retard (No Offense). Robert De Niro plays the die-hard baseball fan who will do anything to impress his favorite baseball player, Bobby Rayburne (Wesley Snipes, and which results in him turning into something sinister and evil. Benicio Del Toro is almost unrecognizable in this film but after catching his face a few times, I finally realized that Benicio Del Toro looks like crap in this film. Jack Black also makes a two-second appearance in this film as the radio station guy. He looks normal and fat, usual. I got this in a triple film-pack which contained Money Train and Unstoppable, so I brought it because it was a good deal. This film deserves a view at least once. It is enjoyable, entertaining, fun, clich&eacute;d and flawed but even though it is all that, you will have a good time. 7/10.

    Putting The "Fan" Into "Fanatic"

    To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The "fading salesman with problems" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" or Shelley Levene in "Glengarry Glen Ross." I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay. De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in "Cape Fear." De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the "what have you done for me lately" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to "help" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell. Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit. The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)

    DeNiro gives an okay, but one-note performance as a dedicated baseball fan who, as a result of his fixation on Bobby Rayburn (#11), loses his job and family. Other than to show that he has a bad temper, I don't see how they are relevant to the movie. I think too much time is spent on the scenes at home, on the job, and on the baseball game itself. And DeNiro's acting just didn't seem genuine at all. In most movies about people who go from obsessing to stalking, this line is crossed at about halfway through the movie. But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more. ** out of ****

    Gil Renard is obsessed with baseball. Because he is from San Francisco he is a fan of the Giants, by the beginning of the season the Giants have signed all-star centre-fielder Bobby Rayburn to a 40 Million dollar contract. But, things do not go well for both Gil and Rayburn. Rayburn is slumping and Gil loses his job and eventually his wife and son. Gil goes deeper into his obsession with Rayburn and takes matters into his own hands. He believes that Rayburn is slumping because of another Giants player named Juan Primo who is playing well. Gil secretly helps him out. But when Gil feels that Rayburn is ungrateful, Gil kidnaps his son. Now, Rayburn must perform at his best at the last game of the season in order to save his son... I don't know why, but I have a lot of love for this movie. It's not perfect by any means, and Scott has really gone to town on the editing here, but everyone has a film that they love that was critically mauled. De Niro is at this archetypal best here as Gil, a paint by the numbers psycho, who isn't spontaneous, but predictable, and still very creepy. Snipes proves in this that the mid nineties were the best for his career, as he puts in another great performance, and during the final third, really shows depth and emotion. There is great support from Leguizamo and Barkin, and the film is made slickly with a brilliant soundtrack, but if you look closer, there are lots of faults in this. It's one of those rare occasions with a movie that I really don't care about the faults or the plot holes or the blatant use of stunt doubles. The eighteen year old in me is still calling for the flashy editing, silly use of knives and De Niro in full psycho mode, and I still love it.

    Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas," and "Cape Fear." In "Top Gun" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller "The Fan," De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of "White Men Can't Jump"), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin). The plot of "The Fan" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of "License to Kill") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel "The Fan" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. "The Fan" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.

    Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.

    ***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball. Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations. It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth! ***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was. The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.

    The Fan is about a baseball player who becomes the unhealthy focus on a salesman who is down on his luck. Seeing the rating, I became very interested in seeing this movie. Now I have seen it, and I am glad that I saw it. Why? I'll tell you why. In my honest to goodness point of view, The Fan is a tense and exciting drama thriller that is a very entertaining movie! Another thing that really wanted me to see this movie is the fact that it stars Robert De Niro, who happens to be one of my all time favorite actors. Now getting back to my review, this movie was a very good movie, it was fun, exciting, intense, and at certain times, very suspenseful. The Fan now has to be one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated Robert De Niro movies that I have ever seen, because I think that the rating in the 5's is rather low for this good movie, a rating in the 6's would be more appropriate. But anyway, I am not letting the rating affect my judgement, this movie is a very good movie, it is a very fun time! As he is in a lot of the movies that I have seen him in, Robert De Niro is excellent. He plays Gil Renard, a salesmen who takes an unhealthy liking for a professional baseball player named Bobby Rayburn, played by Wesley Snipes. No matter what movie he is in, and no matter what role he plays, Robert De Niro never fails to amuse me with his absolutely incredible acting skills. Even if the movie that he stars in isn't that good, he still manages to do an excellent job. I haven't seen a bad Robert De Niro movie yet, there are something that I like more than others, but I can't say that I have seen one that I absolutely hated. So all in all, Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors who has ever lived. I send my congratulations to Robert De Niro for making yet another movie that I totally and completely enjoyed. Well all in all, The Fan is a very underrated movie, no wait, it is a criminally underrated movie. You've got to see this movie if you haven't already, because you will probably enjoy it. While I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of a movie, I nevertheless find it to be a very entertaining and delightful experience! Even if you don't necessarily care for the movie, you probably will like Robert De Niro's performance. Well all in all, this movie is a very entertaining delight, watch it if you haven't seen it already, you will most likely end up really enjoying it! I love Robert De Niro, and I really enjoyed this movie, don't miss out on it. 10/10

    The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league. I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song "Closer" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film). On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old "mentor" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending. Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did.

    To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The "fading salesman with problems" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" or Shelley Levene in "Glengarry Glen Ross." I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay. De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in "Cape Fear." De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the "what have you done for me lately" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to "help" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell. Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit. The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)

    DeNiro gives an okay, but one-note performance as a dedicated baseball fan who, as a result of his fixation on Bobby Rayburn (#11), loses his job and family. Other than to show that he has a bad temper, I don't see how they are relevant to the movie. I think too much time is spent on the scenes at home, on the job, and on the baseball game itself. And DeNiro's acting just didn't seem genuine at all. In most movies about people who go from obsessing to stalking, this line is crossed at about halfway through the movie. But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more. ** out of ****

    Gil Renard is obsessed with baseball. Because he is from San Francisco he is a fan of the Giants, by the beginning of the season the Giants have signed all-star centre-fielder Bobby Rayburn to a 40 Million dollar contract. But, things do not go well for both Gil and Rayburn. Rayburn is slumping and Gil loses his job and eventually his wife and son. Gil goes deeper into his obsession with Rayburn and takes matters into his own hands. He believes that Rayburn is slumping because of another Giants player named Juan Primo who is playing well. Gil secretly helps him out. But when Gil feels that Rayburn is ungrateful, Gil kidnaps his son. Now, Rayburn must perform at his best at the last game of the season in order to save his son... I don't know why, but I have a lot of love for this movie. It's not perfect by any means, and Scott has really gone to town on the editing here, but everyone has a film that they love that was critically mauled. De Niro is at this archetypal best here as Gil, a paint by the numbers psycho, who isn't spontaneous, but predictable, and still very creepy. Snipes proves in this that the mid nineties were the best for his career, as he puts in another great performance, and during the final third, really shows depth and emotion. There is great support from Leguizamo and Barkin, and the film is made slickly with a brilliant soundtrack, but if you look closer, there are lots of faults in this. It's one of those rare occasions with a movie that I really don't care about the faults or the plot holes or the blatant use of stunt doubles. The eighteen year old in me is still calling for the flashy editing, silly use of knives and De Niro in full psycho mode, and I still love it.

    Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas," and "Cape Fear." In "Top Gun" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller "The Fan," De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of "White Men Can't Jump"), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin). The plot of "The Fan" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of "License to Kill") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel "The Fan" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. "The Fan" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.

    Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.

    ***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball. Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations. It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth! ***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was. The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.

    The Fan is about a baseball player who becomes the unhealthy focus on a salesman who is down on his luck. Seeing the rating, I became very interested in seeing this movie. Now I have seen it, and I am glad that I saw it. Why? I'll tell you why. In my honest to goodness point of view, The Fan is a tense and exciting drama thriller that is a very entertaining movie! Another thing that really wanted me to see this movie is the fact that it stars Robert De Niro, who happens to be one of my all time favorite actors. Now getting back to my review, this movie was a very good movie, it was fun, exciting, intense, and at certain times, very suspenseful. The Fan now has to be one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated Robert De Niro movies that I have ever seen, because I think that the rating in the 5's is rather low for this good movie, a rating in the 6's would be more appropriate. But anyway, I am not letting the rating affect my judgement, this movie is a very good movie, it is a very fun time! As he is in a lot of the movies that I have seen him in, Robert De Niro is excellent. He plays Gil Renard, a salesmen who takes an unhealthy liking for a professional baseball player named Bobby Rayburn, played by Wesley Snipes. No matter what movie he is in, and no matter what role he plays, Robert De Niro never fails to amuse me with his absolutely incredible acting skills. Even if the movie that he stars in isn't that good, he still manages to do an excellent job. I haven't seen a bad Robert De Niro movie yet, there are something that I like more than others, but I can't say that I have seen one that I absolutely hated. So all in all, Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors who has ever lived. I send my congratulations to Robert De Niro for making yet another movie that I totally and completely enjoyed. Well all in all, The Fan is a very underrated movie, no wait, it is a criminally underrated movie. You've got to see this movie if you haven't already, because you will probably enjoy it. While I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of a movie, I nevertheless find it to be a very entertaining and delightful experience! Even if you don't necessarily care for the movie, you probably will like Robert De Niro's performance. Well all in all, this movie is a very entertaining delight, watch it if you haven't seen it already, you will most likely end up really enjoying it! I love Robert De Niro, and I really enjoyed this movie, don't miss out on it. 10/10

    The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league. I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song "Closer" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film). On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old "mentor" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending. Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did.

    One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich&eacute; of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies

    The Fan has combined both baseball and a thriller together to make everyone happy. It is slow at the beginning but it gets interesting as the story develops more and more as we look at the life of a famous player and a knife salesman who will later become involved in a life risking dilemma. Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clich&eacute;d and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you. The violence is limited and that's is a good thing but language is high. (MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!)Number one fan Gil Renard whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder Booby Rayburn. While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey. When Primo brushes off the fan's concerns, Gil proceeds to murder the left fielder with one of his makeshift knives! Wesley Snipes finally gives a exceptional performance and he plays his sport role, Bobby Rayburne, very well and he shows emotion along with many other good feelings. The Fan is not so great that you would rather watch this than Kill Bill because you are a complete retard (No Offense). Robert De Niro plays the die-hard baseball fan who will do anything to impress his favorite baseball player, Bobby Rayburne (Wesley Snipes, and which results in him turning into something sinister and evil. Benicio Del Toro is almost unrecognizable in this film but after catching his face a few times, I finally realized that Benicio Del Toro looks like crap in this film. Jack Black also makes a two-second appearance in this film as the radio station guy. He looks normal and fat, usual. I got this in a triple film-pack which contained Money Train and Unstoppable, so I brought it because it was a good deal. This film deserves a view at least once. It is enjoyable, entertaining, fun, clich&eacute;d and flawed but even though it is all that, you will have a good time. 7/10.

    To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The "fading salesman with problems" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" or Shelley Levene in "Glengarry Glen Ross." I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay. De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in "Cape Fear." De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the "what have you done for me lately" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to "help" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell. Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit. The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)

It's not perfect by any means, and Scott has really gone to town on the editing here, but everyone has a film that they love that was critically mauled.

The eighteen year old in me is still calling for the flashy editing, silly use of knives and De Niro in full psycho mode, and I still love it.

    Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Goodfellas," and "Cape Fear." In "Top Gun" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller "The Fan," De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of "White Men Can't Jump"), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin). The plot of "The Fan" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of "License to Kill") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel "The Fan" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. "The Fan" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.

    Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.

    ***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball. Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations. It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth! ***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was. The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.

    The Fan is about a baseball player who becomes the unhealthy focus on a salesman who is down on his luck. Seeing the rating, I became very interested in seeing this movie. Now I have seen it, and I am glad that I saw it. Why? I'll tell you why. In my honest to goodness point of view, The Fan is a tense and exciting drama thriller that is a very entertaining movie! Another thing that really wanted me to see this movie is the fact that it stars Robert De Niro, who happens to be one of my all time favorite actors. Now getting back to my review, this movie was a very good movie, it was fun, exciting, intense, and at certain times, very suspenseful. The Fan now has to be one of the most underrated movies that I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated Robert De Niro movies that I have ever seen, because I think that the rating in the 5's is rather low for this good movie, a rating in the 6's would be more appropriate. But anyway, I am not letting the rating affect my judgement, this movie is a very good movie, it is a very fun time! As he is in a lot of the movies that I have seen him in, Robert De Niro is excellent. He plays Gil Renard, a salesmen who takes an unhealthy liking for a professional baseball player named Bobby Rayburn, played by Wesley Snipes. No matter what movie he is in, and no matter what role he plays, Robert De Niro never fails to amuse me with his absolutely incredible acting skills. Even if the movie that he stars in isn't that good, he still manages to do an excellent job. I haven't seen a bad Robert De Niro movie yet, there are something that I like more than others, but I can't say that I have seen one that I absolutely hated. So all in all, Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors who has ever lived. I send my congratulations to Robert De Niro for making yet another movie that I totally and completely enjoyed. Well all in all, The Fan is a very underrated movie, no wait, it is a criminally underrated movie. You've got to see this movie if you haven't already, because you will probably enjoy it. While I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece of a movie, I nevertheless find it to be a very entertaining and delightful experience! Even if you don't necessarily care for the movie, you probably will like Robert De Niro's performance. Well all in all, this movie is a very entertaining delight, watch it if you haven't seen it already, you will most likely end up really enjoying it! I love Robert De Niro, and I really enjoyed this movie, don't miss out on it. 10/10

    The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league. I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song "Closer" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film). On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old "mentor" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending. Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did.

    One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich&eacute; of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies

    The Fan has combined both baseball and a thriller together to make everyone happy. It is slow at the beginning but it gets interesting as the story develops more and more as we look at the life of a famous player and a knife salesman who will later become involved in a life risking dilemma. Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clich&eacute;d and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you. The violence is limited and that's is a good thing but language is high. (MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!)Number one fan Gil Renard whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder Booby Rayburn. While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey. When Primo brushes off the fan's concerns, Gil proceeds to murder the left fielder with one of his makeshift knives! Wesley Snipes finally gives a exceptional performance and he plays his sport role, Bobby Rayburne, very well and he shows emotion along with many other good feelings. The Fan is not so great that you would rather watch this than Kill Bill because you are a complete retard (No Offense). Robert De Niro plays the die-hard baseball fan who will do anything to impress his favorite baseball player, Bobby Rayburne (Wesley Snipes, and which results in him turning into something sinister and evil. Benicio Del Toro is almost unrecognizable in this film but after catching his face a few times, I finally realized that Benicio Del Toro looks like crap in this film. Jack Black also makes a two-second appearance in this film as the radio station guy. He looks normal and fat, usual. I got this in a triple film-pack which contained Money Train and Unstoppable, so I brought it because it was a good deal. This film deserves a view at least once. It is enjoyable, entertaining, fun, clich&eacute;d and flawed but even though it is all that, you will have a good time. 7/10.
