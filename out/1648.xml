 <sinopse>
  An outsider and a young woman plagued by Tourette's syndrome meet and together journey to Canada.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  "Niagra, Niagra" begins quietly in a drugstore in Poughkeepsie, where Marcie, the film's disarming heroine, likes to shoplift. She literally crashes into Seth, a quiet outsider, also on a shoplifting spree. Marcie invites Seth to accompany her to Canada to find a black hairstyling head. They set off in Seth's beat-up station wagon, destined for a toy store in Toronto. While on the road, Marcie confides to Seth that she has Tourette's syndrome, necessitating a series of detours to liquor stories and pharmacies along the roads of upstate New York.

    This is one of my favorite movies of all time! The acting by Robin Tunney was fantastic, especially considering the unique difficulties with playing this role. I won't divulge many secrets, but she plays the role of a strong girl named Marcy, who is half frustrated and half apathetic/jaded about the serious problems in her life and finds a way to spontaneously escape her surroundings with a new friend played by Henry Thomas, who is reserved in a semi-endearing way and tries to be a peace-keeper during Marcy's outbursts. I couldn't give the movie 10 starts as it's slightly over the top with the emotional guidance attempted by Bob Gosse, almost in a Spielberg-ish kind of way, but 9 stars in accurate.

    This is a little-remembered film from the 90's starring the types of characters from Drugstore Cowboy, Natural Born Killers, and True Romance, except for one has Tourette's syndrome. Their interest in each other gets them caught up in chaotic scenarios and ultimately puts their relationship in peril, even if one of them has a lot of crazy life stories to tell to future children or something. The characters were sort of bland, Gen-Xer, 90's models of 20-somethings who had niche interests in petty theft and living life outside of the local rules. Robin Tunney gives a good performance as the Tourette's girl (name forgotten), but Henry Thomas' character, her significant other, was dull and not bright at alla real pain to watch. The worst part about the film was the missing logic during most of the characters' encounters with people along their journey to Canada. So many awkward experiences could have been avoided if the guy just explained her mental condition in a calm manner to others. Overall, it's a memorable film, to me, but it gets lost in the shuffle between the aforementioned movies and films like Girl, Interrupted which explore more mentally-challenged characters on a deeper, more logical level. It feels more middle-of-the-road, which is why I give it a 5 star rating. A better ending would have boosted that rating up a notch, as well.

    This is a good movie if you're looking for a tale of love. The only thing that really ruins it is a MAJOR plot hole. The whole story revolves around the couple robbing a drug store to get meds for her Tourette's Syndrome. Why did they do this? You run out of meds you call your doctor and get a refill. Or better yet any pharmacy will call your doctor for you. It's not like the meds for Tourette's Syndrome are heroin or cocaine. If you have a prescription you get them. This is a HUGE plot hole. OK the robbery is necessary for dramatic tension but it is 100% unrealistic. Still if you can overlook this plot error it's an excellent movie about love. I still recommend it highly

    I have watched this movie time and time and time again - each time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy (and I'm kind of glad that Kate Winslet and that other lady turned down her part) its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared. Its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together. They stand beside each other no matter what, even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways. I'll tell you now its not for everyone - out of everyone I've shown it to I'd say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!

    Part of this movie was filmed in my hometown in upstate new york, in fact in a brief clip you can see the video store that I rented the movie in (I think they're driving or something). Friends actually met and spoke with Henry and Robin. That's where my emotional attachment to this movie ends. It sucked. I was bored completely and though I do realize that movies like this must be made I am thankful that watching them is not somehow mandatory but simply a matter of accident by sheer numbers. We, as Americans, watch so many movies in our lives that some of them are bound to be steaming piles of drek. Nothing against the actors however.

    I tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. I was immediately sucked in by the characters. Robin Tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. Her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. Really, this sort of thing is not easy to do. She pulls it off fantastically. We know early on this film is going to end tragically, but you cannot take your eyes off of it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters. This is just a great example of film making IMHO. Great writing, great acting, great directing. A film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment.

    I'm a Canadian. I was born and grew up in the Niagara Region and have viewed the Falls hundreds if not thousands of times. That why I had to borrow this movie and view it. I really enjoyed it. The two main actors put in impressive performances and they are the heart and soul of the movie. But as another commentary says,parts BORDER on the incredible. The film-makers made absolutely no attempt to inject any Canadian reality into the section of the movie set in Canada. Toronto is a 2-hour coach ride from Niagara Falls. As to why they wouldn't just go to nearby Buffalo, I'll assume that was because of their obsessiveness. The store employees supposedly in a Toronto shopping plaza spoke with American accents. The Police uniforms are wrong and Canadian police equipment is different in a respect that might, however, effect the plot so I won't be specific. Maybe my criticism really belongs in your errors department.

    I like movies about quirky people. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is maybe my all time favorite, so one can imagine I had a blast with this one. It's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling. This movie is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright frightening, even after multiple viewings (because this kind of stuff really can happen). It will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. And after you see the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you really should check yourself for a pulse. The acting was phenomenal. Marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, shifts from quirky-cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes appearing so out-of-control that she looks like the undead. Seth was great, too. The focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on Marcy, though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character. It's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story next to "True Romance." There are two bad reviews for it up here, but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film, while the other was just looking for some Hollywood thrills without the deep characters (and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot, seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). The point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "lighthearted". This one is messed up and indie as can be, and won't let you go until the heavy climax.

    Niagra Niagra was certainly not the best movie I have seen. However., I cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how I felt as it ended and also how I feel about it now. Very few movies have such an effect on me. I like them or I do not. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun etc... This movie had me in not the best mood. In fact it left me feeling empty somehow. I guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction was to have no direction. They had many problems to deal with and I guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life. But on the way things really only got worse. A steady decline from where it started. It was sad as it was so well acted and I guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in. They might have had a good life if they had any idea how. But it Wes clear they did not know what to do. So they kind of Rambled to someplace they had heard about. No real goal. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them. I felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that I would not like if just anyone played the parts. These two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting. I am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on DVD. You know. It left me feeling a little like Leaving Los Vegas did. But again it is in a class of its own. Not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person who has problems I would not suggest you watch it. It could depress you. It depressed me and I have not the conditions these folks had. JimmyJoeJetter

    I caught this movie late one night and gave it a chance because of the 2 actors in it. I mean who doesn't appreciate Henry Thomas in a movie post-ET? To be truthful i didn't even watch the whole thing but thought it intriguing that they were searching for a black Barbie head...BUT the oddest thing of all... SPOILER WARNING ******************************************!!!!!! What department store in CANADA would randomly shoot a girl because she was knocking over some boxes and screaming (unarmed)! How can anyone get over this, and allow themselves to actually like this movie??? Other then that, it still wasn't that great.

    This is a good movie if you're looking for a tale of love. The only thing that really ruins it is a MAJOR plot hole. The whole story revolves around the couple robbing a drug store to get meds for her Tourette's Syndrome. Why did they do this? You run out of meds you call your doctor and get a refill. Or better yet any pharmacy will call your doctor for you. It's not like the meds for Tourette's Syndrome are heroin or cocaine. If you have a prescription you get them. This is a HUGE plot hole. OK the robbery is necessary for dramatic tension but it is 100% unrealistic. Still if you can overlook this plot error it's an excellent movie about love. I still recommend it highly

    I have watched this movie time and time and time again - each time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy (and I'm kind of glad that Kate Winslet and that other lady turned down her part) its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared. Its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together. They stand beside each other no matter what, even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways. I'll tell you now its not for everyone - out of everyone I've shown it to I'd say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!

    Part of this movie was filmed in my hometown in upstate new york, in fact in a brief clip you can see the video store that I rented the movie in (I think they're driving or something). Friends actually met and spoke with Henry and Robin. That's where my emotional attachment to this movie ends. It sucked. I was bored completely and though I do realize that movies like this must be made I am thankful that watching them is not somehow mandatory but simply a matter of accident by sheer numbers. We, as Americans, watch so many movies in our lives that some of them are bound to be steaming piles of drek. Nothing against the actors however.

    I tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. I was immediately sucked in by the characters. Robin Tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. Her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. Really, this sort of thing is not easy to do. She pulls it off fantastically. We know early on this film is going to end tragically, but you cannot take your eyes off of it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters. This is just a great example of film making IMHO. Great writing, great acting, great directing. A film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment.

    The performances of the two main actors are impressive, but the part set in Canada is embarrassing.

    I'm a Canadian. I was born and grew up in the Niagara Region and have viewed the Falls hundreds if not thousands of times. That why I had to borrow this movie and view it. I really enjoyed it. The two main actors put in impressive performances and they are the heart and soul of the movie. But as another commentary says,parts BORDER on the incredible. The film-makers made absolutely no attempt to inject any Canadian reality into the section of the movie set in Canada. Toronto is a 2-hour coach ride from Niagara Falls. As to why they wouldn't just go to nearby Buffalo, I'll assume that was because of their obsessiveness. The store employees supposedly in a Toronto shopping plaza spoke with American accents. The Police uniforms are wrong and Canadian police equipment is different in a respect that might, however, effect the plot so I won't be specific. Maybe my criticism really belongs in your errors department.

    I like movies about quirky people. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is maybe my all time favorite, so one can imagine I had a blast with this one. It's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling. This movie is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright frightening, even after multiple viewings (because this kind of stuff really can happen). It will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. And after you see the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you really should check yourself for a pulse. The acting was phenomenal. Marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, shifts from quirky-cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes appearing so out-of-control that she looks like the undead. Seth was great, too. The focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on Marcy, though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character. It's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story next to "True Romance." There are two bad reviews for it up here, but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film, while the other was just looking for some Hollywood thrills without the deep characters (and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot, seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). The point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "lighthearted". This one is messed up and indie as can be, and won't let you go until the heavy climax.

    Niagra Niagra was certainly not the best movie I have seen. However., I cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how I felt as it ended and also how I feel about it now. Very few movies have such an effect on me. I like them or I do not. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun etc... This movie had me in not the best mood. In fact it left me feeling empty somehow. I guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction was to have no direction. They had many problems to deal with and I guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life. But on the way things really only got worse. A steady decline from where it started. It was sad as it was so well acted and I guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in. They might have had a good life if they had any idea how. But it Wes clear they did not know what to do. So they kind of Rambled to someplace they had heard about. No real goal. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them. I felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that I would not like if just anyone played the parts. These two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting. I am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on DVD. You know. It left me feeling a little like Leaving Los Vegas did. But again it is in a class of its own. Not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person who has problems I would not suggest you watch it. It could depress you. It depressed me and I have not the conditions these folks had. JimmyJoeJetter

    I caught this movie late one night and gave it a chance because of the 2 actors in it. I mean who doesn't appreciate Henry Thomas in a movie post-ET? To be truthful i didn't even watch the whole thing but thought it intriguing that they were searching for a black Barbie head...BUT the oddest thing of all... SPOILER WARNING ******************************************!!!!!! What department store in CANADA would randomly shoot a girl because she was knocking over some boxes and screaming (unarmed)! How can anyone get over this, and allow themselves to actually like this movie??? Other then that, it still wasn't that great.
