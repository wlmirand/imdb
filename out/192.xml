 <sinopse>
  An emotionally self-destructive boxer's journey through life, as the violence and temper that leads him to the top in the ring, destroys his life outside it.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  When Jake LaMotta steps into a boxing ring and obliterates his opponent, he's a prizefighter. But when he treats his family and friends the same way, he's a ticking time bomb, ready to go off at any moment. Though LaMotta wants his family's love, something always seems to come between them. Perhaps it's his violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy. This kind of rage helped make him a champ, but in real life, he winds up in the ring alone.

    'Raging Bull' has been praised as "The Best Film's of the 80's", "Robert De Niro's Best Performance" and "Scorsese's Best Picture". I can honestly say that one of these above comments are absolutely true. Robert De Niro is incredible from start to finish (or as the films order goes 'finish-to-start-to-finish'). Portraying the unappealing character of Jake La Motta, is the greatest performance that De Niro has given. Gaining weight, losing weight, completely changing his appearance... he is flawless. Raging Bull, on the other hand... is a good film, and an important piece of cinema, but is not 'incredible', and definitely not the "Best Film of the 80's". "The Best film of the 80's" is a title that should be reserved for films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and various other fantastic pieces of 80's cinema, of which 'Raging Bull' has been mistakenly placed over. As for "Scorsese's Best Picture"... watch GoodFellas! Even 'The Aviator', 'Taxi Driver' or 'The Departed'. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of our time. His virtuoso style, extensive tracking shots and brilliant vision when it comes to cinema, is close to unbeatable. But his focus within Raging Bull seems very different to his other pieces. Raging Bull follows the true story of Jake La Motta, a man who became the prized middle weight champion for boxing. La Motta is a tough fighter, but has a self-destructive attitude, which leads to problems in the ring as well as at home. He loses his temper towards friends and family, and results in becoming a very unlikeable figure. His rage helps him in the ring, but results in the loss of other things that he 'loves'. Joe Pesci plays Joey La Motta, Jake's younger brother. Pesci was new to the big screen at this time, so his character that he portrayed seemed relatively new. But in contrast to 'Casino' and 'Lethal Weapon', he plays a similar role of acting tough and lashing out in spurts of aggression. His greatest role, in Goodfellas, was the only diverse performance he has really given, but even that was still remarkably similar. Nevertheless, a well earned supporting actor Oscar nomination. Cathy Moriarty plays Vickie La Motta, Jake's wife, as of around the '1947-1948' mark. I assume that her character plays close to the real-life Vickie, as she is (no offense to the real life Vickie) a little Dull and in some ways, frustrating. To create a character like this would be a bad move, but having to portray this character based on a real figure, is a respected challenge. Some scenes of 'Raging Bull' are exceptionally powerful. Look no more than De Niro beginning to put on weight and arguing with his brother over whether he slept with Vickie or not. The Boxing scenes are also fantastic and well executed. The monochrome photography and slo-mo black and white blood spurts are awesome and very effective. Frequent collaborator 'Thelma Schoonmaker' does a fantastic editing job with this film, as she has with many of Scorsese's other Oscar Winners. The greatest sequence that Raging Bull has to offer, is a sequence that plays true to a series of real-life events. The boxing life and social life montage. Beautifully captured stills depicting La Motta's boxing victories, matched with vivid colour footage of Jake's life blossoming. A fantastic sequence played out with a beautiful soundtrack behind it. In a world depicted as 'Black and White', this sequence shines a little bit of a light. Some scenes in 'Raging Bull' are discomforting and show La Motta's descent into hell, as he tries to take everyone down with him. Some scenes may seem to drag, and the emotional depth begins to quiver. It's these scenes that affect the film greatly. La Motta pouring ice water after arousal, La Motta continuously yelling at minor things, it is an effective character study but seems to drag on instead of steadily flowing. Raging Bull is not "The Best film of the 80's" and is not "Scorsese's best picture", but it is Robert De Niro's most powerful and absolutely greatest performance. De Niro's portrayal of a very unlikeable figure is effective, haunting and emotionally challenging. De Niro is incredible! It's a shame the film isn't as great as he is. <6 out of 10> An important piece of cinema lifted thanks to De Niro's incredible performance.

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't like biography movies. I don't like them , because they basically all the same. They follow the same mechanism : sad childhood, hard work , chance from fate , success , big love, troubles with fame , success in the end. It doesn't matter if the movie is about actor , singer , or sportsman  it's all the same. Not to mention that all those biography movies are rather shallow and emotionally cold . At least for me. "The Raging bull" is a biography of boxer Jake La Motta based on his autobiography. It's a movie that goes different way than typical biography. Instead of success-falls-success type of story here we've got success-falls story. Screenplay written by Paul Schrader ("Taxi driver") and Mardik Martin also introduces us to a different kind of main hero. Jake La Motta isn't a nice person you could easily care about. The whole movie isn't just a retelling of events from main hero's life , but also tries to send some message to audience  be careful and don't destroy your life. I appreciate the ambition , but unfortunately the movie never really works for me. It's certainly a well crafted movie. Scorsese use of music is brilliant  for example watch the opening credits scene . It almost looks like a ballet . The fight scenes are incredibly brutal and have frenetic energy  director of photography Michael Chapman did superb work. The acting is top notch : Robert de Niro IS Jake La Motta . All the hard work he put to play this role is evident on screen . Joe Pesci is also very good as his brother Joey , even if he basically plays here the same thing he played in "Goodfellas" and "Casino"  crazy small guy. Cathy Moriarty gives a great and underrated performance as Vickie  Jake's girlfriend and second wife. Some of the dialogue is something that would make Tarantino proud . Unfortunately , it's all about the screenplay which is badly constructed. "TRB" fells like a two part tragedy . We see act number two and number three , but we don't see the act number one. We don't know anything about our hero's past. How did he met his first wife ? What he did before ? Was he always this aggressive ? What made him the man he is ? Was it he's childhood or some traumatic experience ? We never get any hint of answer to these important questions. Not to mention we never get to see how La Motta tells his first wife that he wants divorce. She just disappears from the screen to make place for Vickie. It's lazy writing , because after all this is biography and this was an important moment in La Motta's life. Also it's really hard to care about La Motta. He seems to be interested in two things  becoming a boxing champion and constantly being jealous about Vickie. He never did anything for somebody's else. And the constant jealous quickly becomes too repetitive and annoying. In a good movie it would be only one important element of main hero's story. Here "TRB" keeps coming back to that subject all the time. It looks like the movie didn't had any idea what to do La Motta. Was he really so primitive ? Or maybe he was crazy ? Anyway I cared about him very little  when he didn't wanted to lose a fight intentionally and when he was punching a wall in prison cell. I cared much more about Joey and Vickie . Despite all the domestic violence from him they kept supporting and caring about him. Maybe movie should be about them , about there love instead of crazy psycho who destroyed his life by himself ? It's hard to care about him , because it's hard to put yourself in his position. There is no point of praising "TRB" as much more realistic movie than "Rocky" , because they both show two sides of boxing . Yes , sometimes the boxing helps underdog to find his place in life . And yes, some boxers how trouble with violence and life outside ring (Mike Tyson). There is lot of shouting and violence here , maybe even too much to stand. The dialogue sometimes is dull : -Hit me , - You said you want to hit me ? , - Yes I said I want you to hit me and so on. "The Raging bull " is an ambitious experiment and probably a well crafted piece of art , that unfortunately doesn't work for me . I give it 5/10.

    Jake LaMotta unleashed a raging tiger whenever he stepped into a boxing ring,and it won him acclaim.That same raging tiger broke free of the cage that contained it a few times too often and proceeded to devour his personal life.Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as LaMotta.Raging Bull is a gritty and dark story of a man who flew high on his own inner demons,yet crashed and burned on those same demons.The black and white cinematography suits the story well,and Joe Pesci leads an excellent supporting cast.It's too dark and violent a story for me to visit often,but nonetheless it is a well done piece of film making.

    Raging Bull. This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.

    This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive  he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one. Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.

    In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ? Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word "what", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

    So I finally got around to watching this, one of those classics that I felt obligated to see. And... hmmm. I can't say it did anything for me at all. It's just... it's all right. Robert De Niro's performance is decent enough, but talk about overrated. His pot belly seems to do most of the work; I honestly can't say this stands out from a number of similar parts he's played. Technically the film is accomplished; again, I wouldn't argue that Scorcese is deserving of praise, but nothing set me on fire here. I did like the moments when De Niro reads all kinds of things into innocent conversations between his wife and other men: the action slows down, increasing the importance and impact of these moments. There's a great scene in a cell. There were other fairly impressive scenes but the fact I can't remember them probably says a lot. Sigh. I found it all completely uninvolving, really. The characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable, and while that's not always a problem in a movie, it is here because the dialogue is so annoying. They talk round and round in circles. Hey, Jake, ya puttin' on weight. I'm what? Ya puttin' on weight. Me? I'm puttin' on weight? Yeah, weight, ya puttin' it on. What ya sayin' Joey? Etc. Absolutely did my head in after a while. Shrug.

    This movie is one of the greatest movies ever created. How is the movie 100 on the top 250? Anyway that you look at this movie it's a masterpiece. It's 5x better than the Dark Knight and those other movies except The Godfather. The story it tells might be my favorite out of all the films I have seen. The plot is that we analyze the boxing life of the boxer Jake La Motta and see how the conflicts going on outside of the ring just ruined his life. Robert De Niro the actor who played Jake La Motta does a great job and won best actor for his performance. It even has a gradual change in time such as, Jake La Motta getting fatter, and the overall emotions of the people surrounding him. This movie is very violent and has many cuss words in it, So I wouldn't suggest it for children. This movie may seem like a Rocky spin off, But in reality it's nothing like it. This movie was the best movie of the 80s and the best boxing movie, I would highly recommend it.

    first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .

Cathy Moriarty gives a great and underrated performance as Vickie  Jake's girlfriend and second wife. Some of the dialogue is something that would make Tarantino proud . Unfortunately , it's all about the screenplay which is badly constructed. "TRB" fells like a two part tragedy . We see act number two and number three , but we don't see the act number one. We don't know anything about our hero's past. How did he met his first wife ? What he did before ? Was he always this aggressive ? What made him the man he is ? Was it he's childhood or some traumatic experience ? We never get any hint of answer to these important questions. Not to mention we never get to see how La Motta tells his first wife that he wants divorce. She just disappears from the screen to make place for Vickie. It's lazy writing , because after all this is biography and this was an important moment in La Motta's life. Also it's really hard to care about La Motta. He seems to be interested in two things  becoming a boxing champion and constantly being jealous about Vickie. He never did anything for somebody's else. And the constant jealous quickly becomes too repetitive and annoying. In a good movie it would be only one important element of main hero's story. Here "TRB" keeps coming back to that subject all the time. It looks like the movie didn't had any idea what to do La Motta. Was he really so primitive ? Or maybe he was crazy ? Anyway I cared about him very little  when he didn't wanted to lose a fight intentionally and when he was punching a wall in prison cell. I cared much more about Joey and Vickie . Despite all the domestic violence from him they kept supporting and caring about him. Maybe movie should be about them , about there love instead of crazy psycho who destroyed his life by himself ? It's hard to care about him , because it's hard to put yourself in his position. There is no point of praising "TRB" as much more realistic movie than "Rocky" , because they both show two sides of boxing . Yes , sometimes the boxing helps underdog to find his place in life . And yes, some boxers how trouble with violence and life outside ring (Mike Tyson). There is lot of shouting and violence here , maybe even too much to stand. The dialogue sometimes is dull : -Hit me , - You said you want to hit me ? , - Yes I said I want you to hit me and so on. "The Raging bull " is an ambitious experiment and probably a well crafted piece of art , that unfortunately doesn't work for me . I give it 5/10.

    Raging Bull. This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.

    This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive  he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one. Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.

    In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ? Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word "what", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

    So I finally got around to watching this, one of those classics that I felt obligated to see. And... hmmm. I can't say it did anything for me at all. It's just... it's all right. Robert De Niro's performance is decent enough, but talk about overrated. His pot belly seems to do most of the work; I honestly can't say this stands out from a number of similar parts he's played. Technically the film is accomplished; again, I wouldn't argue that Scorcese is deserving of praise, but nothing set me on fire here. I did like the moments when De Niro reads all kinds of things into innocent conversations between his wife and other men: the action slows down, increasing the importance and impact of these moments. There's a great scene in a cell. There were other fairly impressive scenes but the fact I can't remember them probably says a lot. Sigh. I found it all completely uninvolving, really. The characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable, and while that's not always a problem in a movie, it is here because the dialogue is so annoying. They talk round and round in circles. Hey, Jake, ya puttin' on weight. I'm what? Ya puttin' on weight. Me? I'm puttin' on weight? Yeah, weight, ya puttin' it on. What ya sayin' Joey? Etc. Absolutely did my head in after a while. Shrug.

    This movie is one of the greatest movies ever created. How is the movie 100 on the top 250? Anyway that you look at this movie it's a masterpiece. It's 5x better than the Dark Knight and those other movies except The Godfather. The story it tells might be my favorite out of all the films I have seen. The plot is that we analyze the boxing life of the boxer Jake La Motta and see how the conflicts going on outside of the ring just ruined his life. Robert De Niro the actor who played Jake La Motta does a great job and won best actor for his performance. It even has a gradual change in time such as, Jake La Motta getting fatter, and the overall emotions of the people surrounding him. This movie is very violent and has many cuss words in it, So I wouldn't suggest it for children. This movie may seem like a Rocky spin off, But in reality it's nothing like it. This movie was the best movie of the 80s and the best boxing movie, I would highly recommend it.

    first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .

    'Raging Bull' has been praised as "The Best Film's of the 80's", "Robert De Niro's Best Performance" and "Scorsese's Best Picture". I can honestly say that one of these above comments are absolutely true. Robert De Niro is incredible from start to finish (or as the films order goes 'finish-to-start-to-finish'). Portraying the unappealing character of Jake La Motta, is the greatest performance that De Niro has given. Gaining weight, losing weight, completely changing his appearance... he is flawless. Raging Bull, on the other hand... is a good film, and an important piece of cinema, but is not 'incredible', and definitely not the "Best Film of the 80's". "The Best film of the 80's" is a title that should be reserved for films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and various other fantastic pieces of 80's cinema, of which 'Raging Bull' has been mistakenly placed over. As for "Scorsese's Best Picture"... watch GoodFellas! Even 'The Aviator', 'Taxi Driver' or 'The Departed'. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of our time. His virtuoso style, extensive tracking shots and brilliant vision when it comes to cinema, is close to unbeatable. But his focus within Raging Bull seems very different to his other pieces. Raging Bull follows the true story of Jake La Motta, a man who became the prized middle weight champion for boxing. La Motta is a tough fighter, but has a self-destructive attitude, which leads to problems in the ring as well as at home. He loses his temper towards friends and family, and results in becoming a very unlikeable figure. His rage helps him in the ring, but results in the loss of other things that he 'loves'. Joe Pesci plays Joey La Motta, Jake's younger brother. Pesci was new to the big screen at this time, so his character that he portrayed seemed relatively new. But in contrast to 'Casino' and 'Lethal Weapon', he plays a similar role of acting tough and lashing out in spurts of aggression. His greatest role, in Goodfellas, was the only diverse performance he has really given, but even that was still remarkably similar. Nevertheless, a well earned supporting actor Oscar nomination. Cathy Moriarty plays Vickie La Motta, Jake's wife, as of around the '1947-1948' mark. I assume that her character plays close to the real-life Vickie, as she is (no offense to the real life Vickie) a little Dull and in some ways, frustrating. To create a character like this would be a bad move, but having to portray this character based on a real figure, is a respected challenge. Some scenes of 'Raging Bull' are exceptionally powerful. Look no more than De Niro beginning to put on weight and arguing with his brother over whether he slept with Vickie or not. The Boxing scenes are also fantastic and well executed. The monochrome photography and slo-mo black and white blood spurts are awesome and very effective. Frequent collaborator 'Thelma Schoonmaker' does a fantastic editing job with this film, as she has with many of Scorsese's other Oscar Winners. The greatest sequence that Raging Bull has to offer, is a sequence that plays true to a series of real-life events. The boxing life and social life montage. Beautifully captured stills depicting La Motta's boxing victories, matched with vivid colour footage of Jake's life blossoming. A fantastic sequence played out with a beautiful soundtrack behind it. In a world depicted as 'Black and White', this sequence shines a little bit of a light. Some scenes in 'Raging Bull' are discomforting and show La Motta's descent into hell, as he tries to take everyone down with him. Some scenes may seem to drag, and the emotional depth begins to quiver. It's these scenes that affect the film greatly. La Motta pouring ice water after arousal, La Motta continuously yelling at minor things, it is an effective character study but seems to drag on instead of steadily flowing. Raging Bull is not "The Best film of the 80's" and is not "Scorsese's best picture", but it is Robert De Niro's most powerful and absolutely greatest performance. De Niro's portrayal of a very unlikeable figure is effective, haunting and emotionally challenging. De Niro is incredible! It's a shame the film isn't as great as he is. <6 out of 10> An important piece of cinema lifted thanks to De Niro's incredible performance.

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't like biography movies. I don't like them , because they basically all the same. They follow the same mechanism : sad childhood, hard work , chance from fate , success , big love, troubles with fame , success in the end. It doesn't matter if the movie is about actor , singer , or sportsman  it's all the same. Not to mention that all those biography movies are rather shallow and emotionally cold . At least for me. "The Raging bull" is a biography of boxer Jake La Motta based on his autobiography. It's a movie that goes different way than typical biography. Instead of success-falls-success type of story here we've got success-falls story. Screenplay written by Paul Schrader ("Taxi driver") and Mardik Martin also introduces us to a different kind of main hero. Jake La Motta isn't a nice person you could easily care about. The whole movie isn't just a retelling of events from main hero's life , but also tries to send some message to audience  be careful and don't destroy your life. I appreciate the ambition , but unfortunately the movie never really works for me. It's certainly a well crafted movie. Scorsese use of music is brilliant  for example watch the opening credits scene . It almost looks like a ballet . The fight scenes are incredibly brutal and have frenetic energy  director of photography Michael Chapman did superb work. The acting is top notch : Robert de Niro IS Jake La Motta . All the hard work he put to play this role is evident on screen . Joe Pesci is also very good as his brother Joey , even if he basically plays here the same thing he played in "Goodfellas" and "Casino"  crazy small guy. Cathy Moriarty gives a great and underrated performance as Vickie  Jake's girlfriend and second wife. Some of the dialogue is something that would make Tarantino proud . Unfortunately , it's all about the screenplay which is badly constructed. "TRB" fells like a two part tragedy . We see act number two and number three , but we don't see the act number one. We don't know anything about our hero's past. How did he met his first wife ? What he did before ? Was he always this aggressive ? What made him the man he is ? Was it he's childhood or some traumatic experience ? We never get any hint of answer to these important questions. Not to mention we never get to see how La Motta tells his first wife that he wants divorce. She just disappears from the screen to make place for Vickie. It's lazy writing , because after all this is biography and this was an important moment in La Motta's life. Also it's really hard to care about La Motta. He seems to be interested in two things  becoming a boxing champion and constantly being jealous about Vickie. He never did anything for somebody's else. And the constant jealous quickly becomes too repetitive and annoying. In a good movie it would be only one important element of main hero's story. Here "TRB" keeps coming back to that subject all the time. It looks like the movie didn't had any idea what to do La Motta. Was he really so primitive ? Or maybe he was crazy ? Anyway I cared about him very little  when he didn't wanted to lose a fight intentionally and when he was punching a wall in prison cell. I cared much more about Joey and Vickie . Despite all the domestic violence from him they kept supporting and caring about him. Maybe movie should be about them , about there love instead of crazy psycho who destroyed his life by himself ? It's hard to care about him , because it's hard to put yourself in his position. There is no point of praising "TRB" as much more realistic movie than "Rocky" , because they both show two sides of boxing . Yes , sometimes the boxing helps underdog to find his place in life . And yes, some boxers how trouble with violence and life outside ring (Mike Tyson). There is lot of shouting and violence here , maybe even too much to stand. The dialogue sometimes is dull : -Hit me , - You said you want to hit me ? , - Yes I said I want you to hit me and so on. "The Raging bull " is an ambitious experiment and probably a well crafted piece of art , that unfortunately doesn't work for me . I give it 5/10.

    In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ? Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word "what", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

    So I finally got around to watching this, one of those classics that I felt obligated to see. And... hmmm. I can't say it did anything for me at all. It's just... it's all right. Robert De Niro's performance is decent enough, but talk about overrated. His pot belly seems to do most of the work; I honestly can't say this stands out from a number of similar parts he's played. Technically the film is accomplished; again, I wouldn't argue that Scorcese is deserving of praise, but nothing set me on fire here. I did like the moments when De Niro reads all kinds of things into innocent conversations between his wife and other men: the action slows down, increasing the importance and impact of these moments. There's a great scene in a cell. There were other fairly impressive scenes but the fact I can't remember them probably says a lot. Sigh. I found it all completely uninvolving, really. The characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable, and while that's not always a problem in a movie, it is here because the dialogue is so annoying. They talk round and round in circles. Hey, Jake, ya puttin' on weight. I'm what? Ya puttin' on weight. Me? I'm puttin' on weight? Yeah, weight, ya puttin' it on. What ya sayin' Joey? Etc. Absolutely did my head in after a while. Shrug.

    This movie is one of the greatest movies ever created. How is the movie 100 on the top 250? Anyway that you look at this movie it's a masterpiece. It's 5x better than the Dark Knight and those other movies except The Godfather. The story it tells might be my favorite out of all the films I have seen. The plot is that we analyze the boxing life of the boxer Jake La Motta and see how the conflicts going on outside of the ring just ruined his life. Robert De Niro the actor who played Jake La Motta does a great job and won best actor for his performance. It even has a gradual change in time such as, Jake La Motta getting fatter, and the overall emotions of the people surrounding him. This movie is very violent and has many cuss words in it, So I wouldn't suggest it for children. This movie may seem like a Rocky spin off, But in reality it's nothing like it. This movie was the best movie of the 80s and the best boxing movie, I would highly recommend it.

    first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .

    'Raging Bull' has been praised as "The Best Film's of the 80's", "Robert De Niro's Best Performance" and "Scorsese's Best Picture". I can honestly say that one of these above comments are absolutely true. Robert De Niro is incredible from start to finish (or as the films order goes 'finish-to-start-to-finish'). Portraying the unappealing character of Jake La Motta, is the greatest performance that De Niro has given. Gaining weight, losing weight, completely changing his appearance... he is flawless. Raging Bull, on the other hand... is a good film, and an important piece of cinema, but is not 'incredible', and definitely not the "Best Film of the 80's". "The Best film of the 80's" is a title that should be reserved for films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and various other fantastic pieces of 80's cinema, of which 'Raging Bull' has been mistakenly placed over. As for "Scorsese's Best Picture"... watch GoodFellas! Even 'The Aviator', 'Taxi Driver' or 'The Departed'. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of our time. His virtuoso style, extensive tracking shots and brilliant vision when it comes to cinema, is close to unbeatable. But his focus within Raging Bull seems very different to his other pieces. Raging Bull follows the true story of Jake La Motta, a man who became the prized middle weight champion for boxing. La Motta is a tough fighter, but has a self-destructive attitude, which leads to problems in the ring as well as at home. He loses his temper towards friends and family, and results in becoming a very unlikeable figure. His rage helps him in the ring, but results in the loss of other things that he 'loves'. Joe Pesci plays Joey La Motta, Jake's younger brother. Pesci was new to the big screen at this time, so his character that he portrayed seemed relatively new. But in contrast to 'Casino' and 'Lethal Weapon', he plays a similar role of acting tough and lashing out in spurts of aggression. His greatest role, in Goodfellas, was the only diverse performance he has really given, but even that was still remarkably similar. Nevertheless, a well earned supporting actor Oscar nomination. Cathy Moriarty plays Vickie La Motta, Jake's wife, as of around the '1947-1948' mark. I assume that her character plays close to the real-life Vickie, as she is (no offense to the real life Vickie) a little Dull and in some ways, frustrating. To create a character like this would be a bad move, but having to portray this character based on a real figure, is a respected challenge. Some scenes of 'Raging Bull' are exceptionally powerful. Look no more than De Niro beginning to put on weight and arguing with his brother over whether he slept with Vickie or not. The Boxing scenes are also fantastic and well executed. The monochrome photography and slo-mo black and white blood spurts are awesome and very effective. Frequent collaborator 'Thelma Schoonmaker' does a fantastic editing job with this film, as she has with many of Scorsese's other Oscar Winners. The greatest sequence that Raging Bull has to offer, is a sequence that plays true to a series of real-life events. The boxing life and social life montage. Beautifully captured stills depicting La Motta's boxing victories, matched with vivid colour footage of Jake's life blossoming. A fantastic sequence played out with a beautiful soundtrack behind it. In a world depicted as 'Black and White', this sequence shines a little bit of a light. Some scenes in 'Raging Bull' are discomforting and show La Motta's descent into hell, as he tries to take everyone down with him. Some scenes may seem to drag, and the emotional depth begins to quiver. It's these scenes that affect the film greatly. La Motta pouring ice water after arousal, La Motta continuously yelling at minor things, it is an effective character study but seems to drag on instead of steadily flowing. Raging Bull is not "The Best film of the 80's" and is not "Scorsese's best picture", but it is Robert De Niro's most powerful and absolutely greatest performance. De Niro's portrayal of a very unlikeable figure is effective, haunting and emotionally challenging. De Niro is incredible! It's a shame the film isn't as great as he is. <6 out of 10> An important piece of cinema lifted thanks to De Niro's incredible performance.

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't like biography movies. I don't like them , because they basically all the same. They follow the same mechanism : sad childhood, hard work , chance from fate , success , big love, troubles with fame , success in the end. It doesn't matter if the movie is about actor , singer , or sportsman  it's all the same. Not to mention that all those biography movies are rather shallow and emotionally cold . At least for me. "The Raging bull" is a biography of boxer Jake La Motta based on his autobiography. It's a movie that goes different way than typical biography. Instead of success-falls-success type of story here we've got success-falls story. Screenplay written by Paul Schrader ("Taxi driver") and Mardik Martin also introduces us to a different kind of main hero. Jake La Motta isn't a nice person you could easily care about. The whole movie isn't just a retelling of events from main hero's life , but also tries to send some message to audience  be careful and don't destroy your life. I appreciate the ambition , but unfortunately the movie never really works for me. It's certainly a well crafted movie. Scorsese use of music is brilliant  for example watch the opening credits scene . It almost looks like a ballet . The fight scenes are incredibly brutal and have frenetic energy  director of photography Michael Chapman did superb work. The acting is top notch : Robert de Niro IS Jake La Motta . All the hard work he put to play this role is evident on screen . Joe Pesci is also very good as his brother Joey , even if he basically plays here the same thing he played in "Goodfellas" and "Casino"  crazy small guy. Cathy Moriarty gives a great and underrated performance as Vickie  Jake's girlfriend and second wife. Some of the dialogue is something that would make Tarantino proud . Unfortunately , it's all about the screenplay which is badly constructed. "TRB" fells like a two part tragedy . We see act number two and number three , but we don't see the act number one. We don't know anything about our hero's past. How did he met his first wife ? What he did before ? Was he always this aggressive ? What made him the man he is ? Was it he's childhood or some traumatic experience ? We never get any hint of answer to these important questions. Not to mention we never get to see how La Motta tells his first wife that he wants divorce. She just disappears from the screen to make place for Vickie. It's lazy writing , because after all this is biography and this was an important moment in La Motta's life. Also it's really hard to care about La Motta. He seems to be interested in two things  becoming a boxing champion and constantly being jealous about Vickie. He never did anything for somebody's else. And the constant jealous quickly becomes too repetitive and annoying. In a good movie it would be only one important element of main hero's story. Here "TRB" keeps coming back to that subject all the time. It looks like the movie didn't had any idea what to do La Motta. Was he really so primitive ? Or maybe he was crazy ? Anyway I cared about him very little  when he didn't wanted to lose a fight intentionally and when he was punching a wall in prison cell. I cared much more about Joey and Vickie . Despite all the domestic violence from him they kept supporting and caring about him. Maybe movie should be about them , about there love instead of crazy psycho who destroyed his life by himself ? It's hard to care about him , because it's hard to put yourself in his position. There is no point of praising "TRB" as much more realistic movie than "Rocky" , because they both show two sides of boxing . Yes , sometimes the boxing helps underdog to find his place in life . And yes, some boxers how trouble with violence and life outside ring (Mike Tyson). There is lot of shouting and violence here , maybe even too much to stand. The dialogue sometimes is dull : -Hit me , - You said you want to hit me ? , - Yes I said I want you to hit me and so on. "The Raging bull " is an ambitious experiment and probably a well crafted piece of art , that unfortunately doesn't work for me . I give it 5/10.

    Jake LaMotta unleashed a raging tiger whenever he stepped into a boxing ring,and it won him acclaim.That same raging tiger broke free of the cage that contained it a few times too often and proceeded to devour his personal life.Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as LaMotta.Raging Bull is a gritty and dark story of a man who flew high on his own inner demons,yet crashed and burned on those same demons.The black and white cinematography suits the story well,and Joe Pesci leads an excellent supporting cast.It's too dark and violent a story for me to visit often,but nonetheless it is a well done piece of film making.

    Raging Bull. This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.

    This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive  he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one. Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.

I can honestly say that one of these above comments are absolutely true. Robert De Niro is incredible from start to finish (or as the films order goes 'finish-to-start-to-finish'). Portraying the unappealing character of Jake La Motta, is the greatest performance that De Niro has given. Gaining weight, losing weight, completely changing his appearance... he is flawless. Raging Bull, on the other hand... is a good film, and an important piece of cinema, but is not 'incredible', and definitely not the "Best Film of the 80's". "The Best film of the 80's" is a title that should be reserved for films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and various other fantastic pieces of 80's cinema, of which 'Raging Bull' has been mistakenly placed over. As for "Scorsese's Best Picture"... watch GoodFellas! Even 'The Aviator', 'Taxi Driver' or 'The Departed'. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of our time. His virtuoso style, extensive tracking shots and brilliant vision when it comes to cinema, is close to unbeatable. But his focus within Raging Bull seems very different to his other pieces. Raging Bull follows the true story of Jake La Motta, a man who became the prized middle weight champion for boxing. La Motta is a tough fighter, but has a self-destructive attitude, which leads to problems in the ring as well as at home. He loses his temper towards friends and family, and results in becoming a very unlikeable figure. His rage helps him in the ring, but results in the loss of other things that he 'loves'. Joe Pesci plays Joey La Motta, Jake's younger brother. Pesci was new to the big screen at this time, so his character that he portrayed seemed relatively new. But in contrast to 'Casino' and 'Lethal Weapon', he plays a similar role of acting tough and lashing out in spurts of aggression. His greatest role, in Goodfellas, was the only diverse performance he has really given, but even that was still remarkably similar. Nevertheless, a well earned supporting actor Oscar nomination. Cathy Moriarty plays Vickie La Motta, Jake's wife, as of around the '1947-1948' mark. I assume that her character plays close to the real-life Vickie, as she is (no offense to the real life Vickie) a little Dull and in some ways, frustrating. To create a character like this would be a bad move, but having to portray this character based on a real figure, is a respected challenge. Some scenes of 'Raging Bull' are exceptionally powerful. Look no more than De Niro beginning to put on weight and arguing with his brother over whether he slept with Vickie or not. The Boxing scenes are also fantastic and well executed. The monochrome photography and slo-mo black and white blood spurts are awesome and very effective. Frequent collaborator 'Thelma Schoonmaker' does a fantastic editing job with this film, as she has with many of Scorsese's other Oscar Winners. The greatest sequence that Raging Bull has to offer, is a sequence that plays true to a series of real-life events. The boxing life and social life montage. Beautifully captured stills depicting La Motta's boxing victories, matched with vivid colour footage of Jake's life blossoming. A fantastic sequence played out with a beautiful soundtrack behind it. In a world depicted as 'Black and White', this sequence shines a little bit of a light. Some scenes in 'Raging Bull' are discomforting and show La Motta's descent into hell, as he tries to take everyone down with him. Some scenes may seem to drag, and the emotional depth begins to quiver. It's these scenes that affect the film greatly. La Motta pouring ice water after arousal, La Motta continuously yelling at minor things, it is an effective character study but seems to drag on instead of steadily flowing. Raging Bull is not "The Best film of the 80's" and is not "Scorsese's best picture", but it is Robert De Niro's most powerful and absolutely greatest performance. De Niro's portrayal of a very unlikeable figure is effective, haunting and emotionally challenging. De Niro is incredible! It's a shame the film isn't as great as he is. <6 out of 10> An important piece of cinema lifted thanks to De Niro's incredible performance.

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't like biography movies. I don't like them , because they basically all the same. They follow the same mechanism : sad childhood, hard work , chance from fate , success , big love, troubles with fame , success in the end. It doesn't matter if the movie is about actor , singer , or sportsman  it's all the same. Not to mention that all those biography movies are rather shallow and emotionally cold . At least for me. "The Raging bull" is a biography of boxer Jake La Motta based on his autobiography. It's a movie that goes different way than typical biography. Instead of success-falls-success type of story here we've got success-falls story. Screenplay written by Paul Schrader ("Taxi driver") and Mardik Martin also introduces us to a different kind of main hero. Jake La Motta isn't a nice person you could easily care about. The whole movie isn't just a retelling of events from main hero's life , but also tries to send some message to audience  be careful and don't destroy your life. I appreciate the ambition , but unfortunately the movie never really works for me. It's certainly a well crafted movie. Scorsese use of music is brilliant  for example watch the opening credits scene . It almost looks like a ballet . The fight scenes are incredibly brutal and have frenetic energy  director of photography Michael Chapman did superb work. The acting is top notch : Robert de Niro IS Jake La Motta . All the hard work he put to play this role is evident on screen . Joe Pesci is also very good as his brother Joey , even if he basically plays here the same thing he played in "Goodfellas" and "Casino"  crazy small guy. Cathy Moriarty gives a great and underrated performance as Vickie  Jake's girlfriend and second wife. Some of the dialogue is something that would make Tarantino proud . Unfortunately , it's all about the screenplay which is badly constructed. "TRB" fells like a two part tragedy . We see act number two and number three , but we don't see the act number one. We don't know anything about our hero's past. How did he met his first wife ? What he did before ? Was he always this aggressive ? What made him the man he is ? Was it he's childhood or some traumatic experience ? We never get any hint of answer to these important questions. Not to mention we never get to see how La Motta tells his first wife that he wants divorce. She just disappears from the screen to make place for Vickie. It's lazy writing , because after all this is biography and this was an important moment in La Motta's life. Also it's really hard to care about La Motta. He seems to be interested in two things  becoming a boxing champion and constantly being jealous about Vickie. He never did anything for somebody's else. And the constant jealous quickly becomes too repetitive and annoying. In a good movie it would be only one important element of main hero's story. Here "TRB" keeps coming back to that subject all the time. It looks like the movie didn't had any idea what to do La Motta. Was he really so primitive ? Or maybe he was crazy ? Anyway I cared about him very little  when he didn't wanted to lose a fight intentionally and when he was punching a wall in prison cell. I cared much more about Joey and Vickie . Despite all the domestic violence from him they kept supporting and caring about him. Maybe movie should be about them , about there love instead of crazy psycho who destroyed his life by himself ? It's hard to care about him , because it's hard to put yourself in his position. There is no point of praising "TRB" as much more realistic movie than "Rocky" , because they both show two sides of boxing . Yes , sometimes the boxing helps underdog to find his place in life . And yes, some boxers how trouble with violence and life outside ring (Mike Tyson). There is lot of shouting and violence here , maybe even too much to stand. The dialogue sometimes is dull : -Hit me , - You said you want to hit me ? , - Yes I said I want you to hit me and so on. "The Raging bull " is an ambitious experiment and probably a well crafted piece of art , that unfortunately doesn't work for me . I give it 5/10.

    Jake LaMotta unleashed a raging tiger whenever he stepped into a boxing ring,and it won him acclaim.That same raging tiger broke free of the cage that contained it a few times too often and proceeded to devour his personal life.Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as LaMotta.Raging Bull is a gritty and dark story of a man who flew high on his own inner demons,yet crashed and burned on those same demons.The black and white cinematography suits the story well,and Joe Pesci leads an excellent supporting cast.It's too dark and violent a story for me to visit often,but nonetheless it is a well done piece of film making.

    Raging Bull. This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.

    This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive  he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one. Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.

    In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ? Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word "what", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

    So I finally got around to watching this, one of those classics that I felt obligated to see. And... hmmm. I can't say it did anything for me at all. It's just... it's all right. Robert De Niro's performance is decent enough, but talk about overrated. His pot belly seems to do most of the work; I honestly can't say this stands out from a number of similar parts he's played. Technically the film is accomplished; again, I wouldn't argue that Scorcese is deserving of praise, but nothing set me on fire here. I did like the moments when De Niro reads all kinds of things into innocent conversations between his wife and other men: the action slows down, increasing the importance and impact of these moments. There's a great scene in a cell. There were other fairly impressive scenes but the fact I can't remember them probably says a lot. Sigh. I found it all completely uninvolving, really. The characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable, and while that's not always a problem in a movie, it is here because the dialogue is so annoying. They talk round and round in circles. Hey, Jake, ya puttin' on weight. I'm what? Ya puttin' on weight. Me? I'm puttin' on weight? Yeah, weight, ya puttin' it on. What ya sayin' Joey? Etc. Absolutely did my head in after a while. Shrug.

    This movie is one of the greatest movies ever created. How is the movie 100 on the top 250? Anyway that you look at this movie it's a masterpiece. It's 5x better than the Dark Knight and those other movies except The Godfather. The story it tells might be my favorite out of all the films I have seen. The plot is that we analyze the boxing life of the boxer Jake La Motta and see how the conflicts going on outside of the ring just ruined his life. Robert De Niro the actor who played Jake La Motta does a great job and won best actor for his performance. It even has a gradual change in time such as, Jake La Motta getting fatter, and the overall emotions of the people surrounding him. This movie is very violent and has many cuss words in it, So I wouldn't suggest it for children. This movie may seem like a Rocky spin off, But in reality it's nothing like it. This movie was the best movie of the 80s and the best boxing movie, I would highly recommend it.

    first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .

    Raging Bull. This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.

    This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive  he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one. Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.

    In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ? Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word "what", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

    So I finally got around to watching this, one of those classics that I felt obligated to see. And... hmmm. I can't say it did anything for me at all. It's just... it's all right. Robert De Niro's performance is decent enough, but talk about overrated. His pot belly seems to do most of the work; I honestly can't say this stands out from a number of similar parts he's played. Technically the film is accomplished; again, I wouldn't argue that Scorcese is deserving of praise, but nothing set me on fire here. I did like the moments when De Niro reads all kinds of things into innocent conversations between his wife and other men: the action slows down, increasing the importance and impact of these moments. There's a great scene in a cell. There were other fairly impressive scenes but the fact I can't remember them probably says a lot. Sigh. I found it all completely uninvolving, really. The characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable, and while that's not always a problem in a movie, it is here because the dialogue is so annoying. They talk round and round in circles. Hey, Jake, ya puttin' on weight. I'm what? Ya puttin' on weight. Me? I'm puttin' on weight? Yeah, weight, ya puttin' it on. What ya sayin' Joey? Etc. Absolutely did my head in after a while. Shrug.

    This movie is one of the greatest movies ever created. How is the movie 100 on the top 250? Anyway that you look at this movie it's a masterpiece. It's 5x better than the Dark Knight and those other movies except The Godfather. The story it tells might be my favorite out of all the films I have seen. The plot is that we analyze the boxing life of the boxer Jake La Motta and see how the conflicts going on outside of the ring just ruined his life. Robert De Niro the actor who played Jake La Motta does a great job and won best actor for his performance. It even has a gradual change in time such as, Jake La Motta getting fatter, and the overall emotions of the people surrounding him. This movie is very violent and has many cuss words in it, So I wouldn't suggest it for children. This movie may seem like a Rocky spin off, But in reality it's nothing like it. This movie was the best movie of the 80s and the best boxing movie, I would highly recommend it.

    first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .

    'Raging Bull' has been praised as "The Best Film's of the 80's", "Robert De Niro's Best Performance" and "Scorsese's Best Picture". I can honestly say that one of these above comments are absolutely true. Robert De Niro is incredible from start to finish (or as the films order goes 'finish-to-start-to-finish'). Portraying the unappealing character of Jake La Motta, is the greatest performance that De Niro has given. Gaining weight, losing weight, completely changing his appearance... he is flawless. Raging Bull, on the other hand... is a good film, and an important piece of cinema, but is not 'incredible', and definitely not the "Best Film of the 80's". "The Best film of the 80's" is a title that should be reserved for films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and various other fantastic pieces of 80's cinema, of which 'Raging Bull' has been mistakenly placed over. As for "Scorsese's Best Picture"... watch GoodFellas! Even 'The Aviator', 'Taxi Driver' or 'The Departed'. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of our time. His virtuoso style, extensive tracking shots and brilliant vision when it comes to cinema, is close to unbeatable. But his focus within Raging Bull seems very different to his other pieces. Raging Bull follows the true story of Jake La Motta, a man who became the prized middle weight champion for boxing. La Motta is a tough fighter, but has a self-destructive attitude, which leads to problems in the ring as well as at home. He loses his temper towards friends and family, and results in becoming a very unlikeable figure. His rage helps him in the ring, but results in the loss of other things that he 'loves'. Joe Pesci plays Joey La Motta, Jake's younger brother. Pesci was new to the big screen at this time, so his character that he portrayed seemed relatively new. But in contrast to 'Casino' and 'Lethal Weapon', he plays a similar role of acting tough and lashing out in spurts of aggression. His greatest role, in Goodfellas, was the only diverse performance he has really given, but even that was still remarkably similar. Nevertheless, a well earned supporting actor Oscar nomination. Cathy Moriarty plays Vickie La Motta, Jake's wife, as of around the '1947-1948' mark. I assume that her character plays close to the real-life Vickie, as she is (no offense to the real life Vickie) a little Dull and in some ways, frustrating. To create a character like this would be a bad move, but having to portray this character based on a real figure, is a respected challenge. Some scenes of 'Raging Bull' are exceptionally powerful. Look no more than De Niro beginning to put on weight and arguing with his brother over whether he slept with Vickie or not. The Boxing scenes are also fantastic and well executed. The monochrome photography and slo-mo black and white blood spurts are awesome and very effective. Frequent collaborator 'Thelma Schoonmaker' does a fantastic editing job with this film, as she has with many of Scorsese's other Oscar Winners. The greatest sequence that Raging Bull has to offer, is a sequence that plays true to a series of real-life events. The boxing life and social life montage. Beautifully captured stills depicting La Motta's boxing victories, matched with vivid colour footage of Jake's life blossoming. A fantastic sequence played out with a beautiful soundtrack behind it. In a world depicted as 'Black and White', this sequence shines a little bit of a light. Some scenes in 'Raging Bull' are discomforting and show La Motta's descent into hell, as he tries to take everyone down with him. Some scenes may seem to drag, and the emotional depth begins to quiver. It's these scenes that affect the film greatly. La Motta pouring ice water after arousal, La Motta continuously yelling at minor things, it is an effective character study but seems to drag on instead of steadily flowing. Raging Bull is not "The Best film of the 80's" and is not "Scorsese's best picture", but it is Robert De Niro's most powerful and absolutely greatest performance. De Niro's portrayal of a very unlikeable figure is effective, haunting and emotionally challenging. De Niro is incredible! It's a shame the film isn't as great as he is. <6 out of 10> An important piece of cinema lifted thanks to De Niro's incredible performance.

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't like biography movies. I don't like them , because they basically all the same. They follow the same mechanism : sad childhood, hard work , chance from fate , success , big love, troubles with fame , success in the end. It doesn't matter if the movie is about actor , singer , or sportsman  it's all the same. Not to mention that all those biography movies are rather shallow and emotionally cold . At least for me. "The Raging bull" is a biography of boxer Jake La Motta based on his autobiography. It's a movie that goes different way than typical biography. Instead of success-falls-success type of story here we've got success-falls story. Screenplay written by Paul Schrader ("Taxi driver") and Mardik Martin also introduces us to a different kind of main hero. Jake La Motta isn't a nice person you could easily care about. The whole movie isn't just a retelling of events from main hero's life , but also tries to send some message to audience  be careful and don't destroy your life. I appreciate the ambition , but unfortunately the movie never really works for me. It's certainly a well crafted movie. Scorsese use of music is brilliant  for example watch the opening credits scene . It almost looks like a ballet . The fight scenes are incredibly brutal and have frenetic energy  director of photography Michael Chapman did superb work. The acting is top notch : Robert de Niro IS Jake La Motta . All the hard work he put to play this role is evident on screen . Joe Pesci is also very good as his brother Joey , even if he basically plays here the same thing he played in "Goodfellas" and "Casino"  crazy small guy. Cathy Moriarty gives a great and underrated performance as Vickie  Jake's girlfriend and second wife. Some of the dialogue is something that would make Tarantino proud . Unfortunately , it's all about the screenplay which is badly constructed. "TRB" fells like a two part tragedy . We see act number two and number three , but we don't see the act number one. We don't know anything about our hero's past. How did he met his first wife ? What he did before ? Was he always this aggressive ? What made him the man he is ? Was it he's childhood or some traumatic experience ? We never get any hint of answer to these important questions. Not to mention we never get to see how La Motta tells his first wife that he wants divorce. She just disappears from the screen to make place for Vickie. It's lazy writing , because after all this is biography and this was an important moment in La Motta's life. Also it's really hard to care about La Motta. He seems to be interested in two things  becoming a boxing champion and constantly being jealous about Vickie. He never did anything for somebody's else. And the constant jealous quickly becomes too repetitive and annoying. In a good movie it would be only one important element of main hero's story. Here "TRB" keeps coming back to that subject all the time. It looks like the movie didn't had any idea what to do La Motta. Was he really so primitive ? Or maybe he was crazy ? Anyway I cared about him very little  when he didn't wanted to lose a fight intentionally and when he was punching a wall in prison cell. I cared much more about Joey and Vickie . Despite all the domestic violence from him they kept supporting and caring about him. Maybe movie should be about them , about there love instead of crazy psycho who destroyed his life by himself ? It's hard to care about him , because it's hard to put yourself in his position. There is no point of praising "TRB" as much more realistic movie than "Rocky" , because they both show two sides of boxing . Yes , sometimes the boxing helps underdog to find his place in life . And yes, some boxers how trouble with violence and life outside ring (Mike Tyson). There is lot of shouting and violence here , maybe even too much to stand. The dialogue sometimes is dull : -Hit me , - You said you want to hit me ? , - Yes I said I want you to hit me and so on. "The Raging bull " is an ambitious experiment and probably a well crafted piece of art , that unfortunately doesn't work for me . I give it 5/10.

    So I finally got around to watching this, one of those classics that I felt obligated to see. And... hmmm. I can't say it did anything for me at all. It's just... it's all right. Robert De Niro's performance is decent enough, but talk about overrated. His pot belly seems to do most of the work; I honestly can't say this stands out from a number of similar parts he's played. Technically the film is accomplished; again, I wouldn't argue that Scorcese is deserving of praise, but nothing set me on fire here. I did like the moments when De Niro reads all kinds of things into innocent conversations between his wife and other men: the action slows down, increasing the importance and impact of these moments. There's a great scene in a cell. There were other fairly impressive scenes but the fact I can't remember them probably says a lot. Sigh. I found it all completely uninvolving, really. The characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable, and while that's not always a problem in a movie, it is here because the dialogue is so annoying. They talk round and round in circles. Hey, Jake, ya puttin' on weight. I'm what? Ya puttin' on weight. Me? I'm puttin' on weight? Yeah, weight, ya puttin' it on. What ya sayin' Joey? Etc. Absolutely did my head in after a while. Shrug.

    This movie is one of the greatest movies ever created. How is the movie 100 on the top 250? Anyway that you look at this movie it's a masterpiece. It's 5x better than the Dark Knight and those other movies except The Godfather. The story it tells might be my favorite out of all the films I have seen. The plot is that we analyze the boxing life of the boxer Jake La Motta and see how the conflicts going on outside of the ring just ruined his life. Robert De Niro the actor who played Jake La Motta does a great job and won best actor for his performance. It even has a gradual change in time such as, Jake La Motta getting fatter, and the overall emotions of the people surrounding him. This movie is very violent and has many cuss words in it, So I wouldn't suggest it for children. This movie may seem like a Rocky spin off, But in reality it's nothing like it. This movie was the best movie of the 80s and the best boxing movie, I would highly recommend it.

    first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .

    'Raging Bull' has been praised as "The Best Film's of the 80's", "Robert De Niro's Best Performance" and "Scorsese's Best Picture". I can honestly say that one of these above comments are absolutely true. Robert De Niro is incredible from start to finish (or as the films order goes 'finish-to-start-to-finish'). Portraying the unappealing character of Jake La Motta, is the greatest performance that De Niro has given. Gaining weight, losing weight, completely changing his appearance... he is flawless. Raging Bull, on the other hand... is a good film, and an important piece of cinema, but is not 'incredible', and definitely not the "Best Film of the 80's". "The Best film of the 80's" is a title that should be reserved for films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and various other fantastic pieces of 80's cinema, of which 'Raging Bull' has been mistakenly placed over. As for "Scorsese's Best Picture"... watch GoodFellas! Even 'The Aviator', 'Taxi Driver' or 'The Departed'. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of our time. His virtuoso style, extensive tracking shots and brilliant vision when it comes to cinema, is close to unbeatable. But his focus within Raging Bull seems very different to his other pieces. Raging Bull follows the true story of Jake La Motta, a man who became the prized middle weight champion for boxing. La Motta is a tough fighter, but has a self-destructive attitude, which leads to problems in the ring as well as at home. He loses his temper towards friends and family, and results in becoming a very unlikeable figure. His rage helps him in the ring, but results in the loss of other things that he 'loves'. Joe Pesci plays Joey La Motta, Jake's younger brother. Pesci was new to the big screen at this time, so his character that he portrayed seemed relatively new. But in contrast to 'Casino' and 'Lethal Weapon', he plays a similar role of acting tough and lashing out in spurts of aggression. His greatest role, in Goodfellas, was the only diverse performance he has really given, but even that was still remarkably similar. Nevertheless, a well earned supporting actor Oscar nomination. Cathy Moriarty plays Vickie La Motta, Jake's wife, as of around the '1947-1948' mark. I assume that her character plays close to the real-life Vickie, as she is (no offense to the real life Vickie) a little Dull and in some ways, frustrating. To create a character like this would be a bad move, but having to portray this character based on a real figure, is a respected challenge. Some scenes of 'Raging Bull' are exceptionally powerful. Look no more than De Niro beginning to put on weight and arguing with his brother over whether he slept with Vickie or not. The Boxing scenes are also fantastic and well executed. The monochrome photography and slo-mo black and white blood spurts are awesome and very effective. Frequent collaborator 'Thelma Schoonmaker' does a fantastic editing job with this film, as she has with many of Scorsese's other Oscar Winners. The greatest sequence that Raging Bull has to offer, is a sequence that plays true to a series of real-life events. The boxing life and social life montage. Beautifully captured stills depicting La Motta's boxing victories, matched with vivid colour footage of Jake's life blossoming. A fantastic sequence played out with a beautiful soundtrack behind it. In a world depicted as 'Black and White', this sequence shines a little bit of a light. Some scenes in 'Raging Bull' are discomforting and show La Motta's descent into hell, as he tries to take everyone down with him. Some scenes may seem to drag, and the emotional depth begins to quiver. It's these scenes that affect the film greatly. La Motta pouring ice water after arousal, La Motta continuously yelling at minor things, it is an effective character study but seems to drag on instead of steadily flowing. Raging Bull is not "The Best film of the 80's" and is not "Scorsese's best picture", but it is Robert De Niro's most powerful and absolutely greatest performance. De Niro's portrayal of a very unlikeable figure is effective, haunting and emotionally challenging. De Niro is incredible! It's a shame the film isn't as great as he is. <6 out of 10> An important piece of cinema lifted thanks to De Niro's incredible performance.

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't like biography movies. I don't like them , because they basically all the same. They follow the same mechanism : sad childhood, hard work , chance from fate , success , big love, troubles with fame , success in the end. It doesn't matter if the movie is about actor , singer , or sportsman  it's all the same. Not to mention that all those biography movies are rather shallow and emotionally cold . At least for me. "The Raging bull" is a biography of boxer Jake La Motta based on his autobiography. It's a movie that goes different way than typical biography. Instead of success-falls-success type of story here we've got success-falls story. Screenplay written by Paul Schrader ("Taxi driver") and Mardik Martin also introduces us to a different kind of main hero. Jake La Motta isn't a nice person you could easily care about. The whole movie isn't just a retelling of events from main hero's life , but also tries to send some message to audience  be careful and don't destroy your life. I appreciate the ambition , but unfortunately the movie never really works for me. It's certainly a well crafted movie. Scorsese use of music is brilliant  for example watch the opening credits scene . It almost looks like a ballet . The fight scenes are incredibly brutal and have frenetic energy  director of photography Michael Chapman did superb work. The acting is top notch : Robert de Niro IS Jake La Motta . All the hard work he put to play this role is evident on screen . Joe Pesci is also very good as his brother Joey , even if he basically plays here the same thing he played in "Goodfellas" and "Casino"  crazy small guy. Cathy Moriarty gives a great and underrated performance as Vickie  Jake's girlfriend and second wife. Some of the dialogue is something that would make Tarantino proud . Unfortunately , it's all about the screenplay which is badly constructed. "TRB" fells like a two part tragedy . We see act number two and number three , but we don't see the act number one. We don't know anything about our hero's past. How did he met his first wife ? What he did before ? Was he always this aggressive ? What made him the man he is ? Was it he's childhood or some traumatic experience ? We never get any hint of answer to these important questions. Not to mention we never get to see how La Motta tells his first wife that he wants divorce. She just disappears from the screen to make place for Vickie. It's lazy writing , because after all this is biography and this was an important moment in La Motta's life. Also it's really hard to care about La Motta. He seems to be interested in two things  becoming a boxing champion and constantly being jealous about Vickie. He never did anything for somebody's else. And the constant jealous quickly becomes too repetitive and annoying. In a good movie it would be only one important element of main hero's story. Here "TRB" keeps coming back to that subject all the time. It looks like the movie didn't had any idea what to do La Motta. Was he really so primitive ? Or maybe he was crazy ? Anyway I cared about him very little  when he didn't wanted to lose a fight intentionally and when he was punching a wall in prison cell. I cared much more about Joey and Vickie . Despite all the domestic violence from him they kept supporting and caring about him. Maybe movie should be about them , about there love instead of crazy psycho who destroyed his life by himself ? It's hard to care about him , because it's hard to put yourself in his position. There is no point of praising "TRB" as much more realistic movie than "Rocky" , because they both show two sides of boxing . Yes , sometimes the boxing helps underdog to find his place in life . And yes, some boxers how trouble with violence and life outside ring (Mike Tyson). There is lot of shouting and violence here , maybe even too much to stand. The dialogue sometimes is dull : -Hit me , - You said you want to hit me ? , - Yes I said I want you to hit me and so on. "The Raging bull " is an ambitious experiment and probably a well crafted piece of art , that unfortunately doesn't work for me . I give it 5/10.

    Jake LaMotta unleashed a raging tiger whenever he stepped into a boxing ring,and it won him acclaim.That same raging tiger broke free of the cage that contained it a few times too often and proceeded to devour his personal life.Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as LaMotta.Raging Bull is a gritty and dark story of a man who flew high on his own inner demons,yet crashed and burned on those same demons.The black and white cinematography suits the story well,and Joe Pesci leads an excellent supporting cast.It's too dark and violent a story for me to visit often,but nonetheless it is a well done piece of film making.

    Raging Bull. This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.

    This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive  he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one. Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.

    In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ? Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word "what", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

In a world depicted as 'Black and White', this sequence shines a little bit of a light. Some scenes in 'Raging Bull' are discomforting and show La Motta's descent into hell, as he tries to take everyone down with him. Some scenes may seem to drag, and the emotional depth begins to quiver. It's these scenes that affect the film greatly. La Motta pouring ice water after arousal, La Motta continuously yelling at minor things, it is an effective character study but seems to drag on instead of steadily flowing. Raging Bull is not "The Best film of the 80's" and is not "Scorsese's best picture", but it is Robert De Niro's most powerful and absolutely greatest performance. De Niro's portrayal of a very unlikeable figure is effective, haunting and emotionally challenging. De Niro is incredible! It's a shame the film isn't as great as he is. <6 out of 10> An important piece of cinema lifted thanks to De Niro's incredible performance.

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't like biography movies. I don't like them , because they basically all the same. They follow the same mechanism : sad childhood, hard work , chance from fate , success , big love, troubles with fame , success in the end. It doesn't matter if the movie is about actor , singer , or sportsman  it's all the same. Not to mention that all those biography movies are rather shallow and emotionally cold . At least for me. "The Raging bull" is a biography of boxer Jake La Motta based on his autobiography. It's a movie that goes different way than typical biography. Instead of success-falls-success type of story here we've got success-falls story. Screenplay written by Paul Schrader ("Taxi driver") and Mardik Martin also introduces us to a different kind of main hero. Jake La Motta isn't a nice person you could easily care about. The whole movie isn't just a retelling of events from main hero's life , but also tries to send some message to audience  be careful and don't destroy your life. I appreciate the ambition , but unfortunately the movie never really works for me. It's certainly a well crafted movie. Scorsese use of music is brilliant  for example watch the opening credits scene . It almost looks like a ballet . The fight scenes are incredibly brutal and have frenetic energy  director of photography Michael Chapman did superb work. The acting is top notch : Robert de Niro IS Jake La Motta . All the hard work he put to play this role is evident on screen . Joe Pesci is also very good as his brother Joey , even if he basically plays here the same thing he played in "Goodfellas" and "Casino"  crazy small guy. Cathy Moriarty gives a great and underrated performance as Vickie  Jake's girlfriend and second wife. Some of the dialogue is something that would make Tarantino proud . Unfortunately , it's all about the screenplay which is badly constructed. "TRB" fells like a two part tragedy . We see act number two and number three , but we don't see the act number one. We don't know anything about our hero's past. How did he met his first wife ? What he did before ? Was he always this aggressive ? What made him the man he is ? Was it he's childhood or some traumatic experience ? We never get any hint of answer to these important questions. Not to mention we never get to see how La Motta tells his first wife that he wants divorce. She just disappears from the screen to make place for Vickie. It's lazy writing , because after all this is biography and this was an important moment in La Motta's life. Also it's really hard to care about La Motta. He seems to be interested in two things  becoming a boxing champion and constantly being jealous about Vickie. He never did anything for somebody's else. And the constant jealous quickly becomes too repetitive and annoying. In a good movie it would be only one important element of main hero's story. Here "TRB" keeps coming back to that subject all the time. It looks like the movie didn't had any idea what to do La Motta. Was he really so primitive ? Or maybe he was crazy ? Anyway I cared about him very little  when he didn't wanted to lose a fight intentionally and when he was punching a wall in prison cell. I cared much more about Joey and Vickie . Despite all the domestic violence from him they kept supporting and caring about him. Maybe movie should be about them , about there love instead of crazy psycho who destroyed his life by himself ? It's hard to care about him , because it's hard to put yourself in his position. There is no point of praising "TRB" as much more realistic movie than "Rocky" , because they both show two sides of boxing . Yes , sometimes the boxing helps underdog to find his place in life . And yes, some boxers how trouble with violence and life outside ring (Mike Tyson). There is lot of shouting and violence here , maybe even too much to stand. The dialogue sometimes is dull : -Hit me , - You said you want to hit me ? , - Yes I said I want you to hit me and so on. "The Raging bull " is an ambitious experiment and probably a well crafted piece of art , that unfortunately doesn't work for me . I give it 5/10.

    Raging Bull. This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.

    This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive  he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one. Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.

    In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ? Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word "what", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

    So I finally got around to watching this, one of those classics that I felt obligated to see. And... hmmm. I can't say it did anything for me at all. It's just... it's all right. Robert De Niro's performance is decent enough, but talk about overrated. His pot belly seems to do most of the work; I honestly can't say this stands out from a number of similar parts he's played. Technically the film is accomplished; again, I wouldn't argue that Scorcese is deserving of praise, but nothing set me on fire here. I did like the moments when De Niro reads all kinds of things into innocent conversations between his wife and other men: the action slows down, increasing the importance and impact of these moments. There's a great scene in a cell. There were other fairly impressive scenes but the fact I can't remember them probably says a lot. Sigh. I found it all completely uninvolving, really. The characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable, and while that's not always a problem in a movie, it is here because the dialogue is so annoying. They talk round and round in circles. Hey, Jake, ya puttin' on weight. I'm what? Ya puttin' on weight. Me? I'm puttin' on weight? Yeah, weight, ya puttin' it on. What ya sayin' Joey? Etc. Absolutely did my head in after a while. Shrug.

    This movie is one of the greatest movies ever created. How is the movie 100 on the top 250? Anyway that you look at this movie it's a masterpiece. It's 5x better than the Dark Knight and those other movies except The Godfather. The story it tells might be my favorite out of all the films I have seen. The plot is that we analyze the boxing life of the boxer Jake La Motta and see how the conflicts going on outside of the ring just ruined his life. Robert De Niro the actor who played Jake La Motta does a great job and won best actor for his performance. It even has a gradual change in time such as, Jake La Motta getting fatter, and the overall emotions of the people surrounding him. This movie is very violent and has many cuss words in it, So I wouldn't suggest it for children. This movie may seem like a Rocky spin off, But in reality it's nothing like it. This movie was the best movie of the 80s and the best boxing movie, I would highly recommend it.

    first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .

    'Raging Bull' has been praised as "The Best Film's of the 80's", "Robert De Niro's Best Performance" and "Scorsese's Best Picture". I can honestly say that one of these above comments are absolutely true. Robert De Niro is incredible from start to finish (or as the films order goes 'finish-to-start-to-finish'). Portraying the unappealing character of Jake La Motta, is the greatest performance that De Niro has given. Gaining weight, losing weight, completely changing his appearance... he is flawless. Raging Bull, on the other hand... is a good film, and an important piece of cinema, but is not 'incredible', and definitely not the "Best Film of the 80's". "The Best film of the 80's" is a title that should be reserved for films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and various other fantastic pieces of 80's cinema, of which 'Raging Bull' has been mistakenly placed over. As for "Scorsese's Best Picture"... watch GoodFellas! Even 'The Aviator', 'Taxi Driver' or 'The Departed'. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of our time. His virtuoso style, extensive tracking shots and brilliant vision when it comes to cinema, is close to unbeatable. But his focus within Raging Bull seems very different to his other pieces. Raging Bull follows the true story of Jake La Motta, a man who became the prized middle weight champion for boxing. La Motta is a tough fighter, but has a self-destructive attitude, which leads to problems in the ring as well as at home. He loses his temper towards friends and family, and results in becoming a very unlikeable figure. His rage helps him in the ring, but results in the loss of other things that he 'loves'. Joe Pesci plays Joey La Motta, Jake's younger brother. Pesci was new to the big screen at this time, so his character that he portrayed seemed relatively new. But in contrast to 'Casino' and 'Lethal Weapon', he plays a similar role of acting tough and lashing out in spurts of aggression. His greatest role, in Goodfellas, was the only diverse performance he has really given, but even that was still remarkably similar. Nevertheless, a well earned supporting actor Oscar nomination. Cathy Moriarty plays Vickie La Motta, Jake's wife, as of around the '1947-1948' mark. I assume that her character plays close to the real-life Vickie, as she is (no offense to the real life Vickie) a little Dull and in some ways, frustrating. To create a character like this would be a bad move, but having to portray this character based on a real figure, is a respected challenge. Some scenes of 'Raging Bull' are exceptionally powerful. Look no more than De Niro beginning to put on weight and arguing with his brother over whether he slept with Vickie or not. The Boxing scenes are also fantastic and well executed. The monochrome photography and slo-mo black and white blood spurts are awesome and very effective. Frequent collaborator 'Thelma Schoonmaker' does a fantastic editing job with this film, as she has with many of Scorsese's other Oscar Winners. The greatest sequence that Raging Bull has to offer, is a sequence that plays true to a series of real-life events. The boxing life and social life montage. Beautifully captured stills depicting La Motta's boxing victories, matched with vivid colour footage of Jake's life blossoming. A fantastic sequence played out with a beautiful soundtrack behind it. In a world depicted as 'Black and White', this sequence shines a little bit of a light. Some scenes in 'Raging Bull' are discomforting and show La Motta's descent into hell, as he tries to take everyone down with him. Some scenes may seem to drag, and the emotional depth begins to quiver. It's these scenes that affect the film greatly. La Motta pouring ice water after arousal, La Motta continuously yelling at minor things, it is an effective character study but seems to drag on instead of steadily flowing. Raging Bull is not "The Best film of the 80's" and is not "Scorsese's best picture", but it is Robert De Niro's most powerful and absolutely greatest performance. De Niro's portrayal of a very unlikeable figure is effective, haunting and emotionally challenging. De Niro is incredible! It's a shame the film isn't as great as he is. <6 out of 10> An important piece of cinema lifted thanks to De Niro's incredible performance.

But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains. Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.

    This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive  he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one. Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.

    In the forties, Jake LaMotta is an aggressive middleweight boxer from NYC nicknamed The Bronx Bull, who is desperate to get a shot at a big title. Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ? Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word "what", which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

    So I finally got around to watching this, one of those classics that I felt obligated to see. And... hmmm. I can't say it did anything for me at all. It's just... it's all right. Robert De Niro's performance is decent enough, but talk about overrated. His pot belly seems to do most of the work; I honestly can't say this stands out from a number of similar parts he's played. Technically the film is accomplished; again, I wouldn't argue that Scorcese is deserving of praise, but nothing set me on fire here. I did like the moments when De Niro reads all kinds of things into innocent conversations between his wife and other men: the action slows down, increasing the importance and impact of these moments. There's a great scene in a cell. There were other fairly impressive scenes but the fact I can't remember them probably says a lot. Sigh. I found it all completely uninvolving, really. The characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable, and while that's not always a problem in a movie, it is here because the dialogue is so annoying. They talk round and round in circles. Hey, Jake, ya puttin' on weight. I'm what? Ya puttin' on weight. Me? I'm puttin' on weight? Yeah, weight, ya puttin' it on. What ya sayin' Joey? Etc. Absolutely did my head in after a while. Shrug.

    This movie is one of the greatest movies ever created. How is the movie 100 on the top 250? Anyway that you look at this movie it's a masterpiece. It's 5x better than the Dark Knight and those other movies except The Godfather. The story it tells might be my favorite out of all the films I have seen. The plot is that we analyze the boxing life of the boxer Jake La Motta and see how the conflicts going on outside of the ring just ruined his life. Robert De Niro the actor who played Jake La Motta does a great job and won best actor for his performance. It even has a gradual change in time such as, Jake La Motta getting fatter, and the overall emotions of the people surrounding him. This movie is very violent and has many cuss words in it, So I wouldn't suggest it for children. This movie may seem like a Rocky spin off, But in reality it's nothing like it. This movie was the best movie of the 80s and the best boxing movie, I would highly recommend it.

    first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .
