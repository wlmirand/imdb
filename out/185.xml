    Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career. Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower. The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters. The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal. Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself "Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene. Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film. Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience. Grade: A+ Rating: 10.5/10

    Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just.....wow.

    This is the movie about psycho killer's story. The main characters are one woman who works at office, her boyfriend, sister, one man who managing a motel, and his mother. It will be interesting that you watch it and guess the killer and why the killer kills victim. I am interested in this movie. It is because when I research this movie, the website said this movie became a forerunner of psycho homicide movie. Then, I saw this movie at the theater (By chance, the movie was shown at one theater). I was so excited about this movie. The scene that policeman and private eye talks about the madder how and who did it is really interesting. I was surprised last scene. I recommend this movie. It is oldest psycho homicide movie. Psycho homicide movies are popular now days. I like kind of this movie. If you also like kind of this movies, you must try to watch it!

    In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation. Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escapehow we "scratch and claw" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like "in an institution or something". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's "harmless". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go "a little mad sometimes". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable fa&ccedil;ade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one. This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face. To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.

    As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he "Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.

    "Psycho" considered the best movie which has directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I think that's true. "Psycho" left by history and became very famous and it is famous until today. Anthony Perkins interpretation is outstanding as Norman Bates a young man who manages a motel. Janet Leigh made an also great interpretation as Marion Crane a woman who stole $40,000 from the company which worked and run out to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Alfred Hitchcock directs again a masterpiece but this time I think that he did his best with this movie. I think that "Psycho" is the best horror movie of all time and the best movie of Alfred Hitchcock.

    Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest.

    Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to "torture porn". Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking. Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.

    Psycho is the second film I watch from Alfred Hitchcock and it's absolutely stunning. Just like Vertigo, it also contains a very interesting and shocking twist, being one of the most original endings I've seen in a while. Anthony Perkins gives an electrifying performance as Norman Bates and I always found his interactions with the other characters very interesting to see. He manages to be charismatic, awkward and chilling with perfection, being one of the highlights here. Hitchcock is the master of suspense indeed and there are moments of sheer terror, escorted by a haunting score, which was just brilliant and added more intensity to these occasions.

    . . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to "humor" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 "Making of" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a "necessary evil," feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the "Roaring Twenties" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum "cooling off period" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of "being humored" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!

    In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation. Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escapehow we "scratch and claw" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like "in an institution or something". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's "harmless". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go "a little mad sometimes". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable fa&ccedil;ade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one. This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face. To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.

    As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he "Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.

    "Psycho" considered the best movie which has directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I think that's true. "Psycho" left by history and became very famous and it is famous until today. Anthony Perkins interpretation is outstanding as Norman Bates a young man who manages a motel. Janet Leigh made an also great interpretation as Marion Crane a woman who stole $40,000 from the company which worked and run out to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Alfred Hitchcock directs again a masterpiece but this time I think that he did his best with this movie. I think that "Psycho" is the best horror movie of all time and the best movie of Alfred Hitchcock.

    Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest.

    Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to "torture porn". Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking. Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.

    . . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to "humor" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 "Making of" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a "necessary evil," feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the "Roaring Twenties" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum "cooling off period" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of "being humored" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!

    Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career. Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower. The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters. The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal. Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself "Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene. Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film. Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience. Grade: A+ Rating: 10.5/10

    Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just.....wow.

    This is the movie about psycho killer's story. The main characters are one woman who works at office, her boyfriend, sister, one man who managing a motel, and his mother. It will be interesting that you watch it and guess the killer and why the killer kills victim. I am interested in this movie. It is because when I research this movie, the website said this movie became a forerunner of psycho homicide movie. Then, I saw this movie at the theater (By chance, the movie was shown at one theater). I was so excited about this movie. The scene that policeman and private eye talks about the madder how and who did it is really interesting. I was surprised last scene. I recommend this movie. It is oldest psycho homicide movie. Psycho homicide movies are popular now days. I like kind of this movie. If you also like kind of this movies, you must try to watch it!

    . . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to "humor" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 "Making of" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a "necessary evil," feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the "Roaring Twenties" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum "cooling off period" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of "being humored" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!

    Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career. Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower. The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters. The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal. Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself "Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene. Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film. Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience. Grade: A+ Rating: 10.5/10

    Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just.....wow.

    This is the movie about psycho killer's story. The main characters are one woman who works at office, her boyfriend, sister, one man who managing a motel, and his mother. It will be interesting that you watch it and guess the killer and why the killer kills victim. I am interested in this movie. It is because when I research this movie, the website said this movie became a forerunner of psycho homicide movie. Then, I saw this movie at the theater (By chance, the movie was shown at one theater). I was so excited about this movie. The scene that policeman and private eye talks about the madder how and who did it is really interesting. I was surprised last scene. I recommend this movie. It is oldest psycho homicide movie. Psycho homicide movies are popular now days. I like kind of this movie. If you also like kind of this movies, you must try to watch it!

    In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation. Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escapehow we "scratch and claw" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like "in an institution or something". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's "harmless". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go "a little mad sometimes". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable fa&ccedil;ade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one. This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face. To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.

    As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he "Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.

    "Psycho" considered the best movie which has directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I think that's true. "Psycho" left by history and became very famous and it is famous until today. Anthony Perkins interpretation is outstanding as Norman Bates a young man who manages a motel. Janet Leigh made an also great interpretation as Marion Crane a woman who stole $40,000 from the company which worked and run out to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Alfred Hitchcock directs again a masterpiece but this time I think that he did his best with this movie. I think that "Psycho" is the best horror movie of all time and the best movie of Alfred Hitchcock.

    Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest.

    Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to "torture porn". Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking. Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.

    Psycho is the second film I watch from Alfred Hitchcock and it's absolutely stunning. Just like Vertigo, it also contains a very interesting and shocking twist, being one of the most original endings I've seen in a while. Anthony Perkins gives an electrifying performance as Norman Bates and I always found his interactions with the other characters very interesting to see. He manages to be charismatic, awkward and chilling with perfection, being one of the highlights here. Hitchcock is the master of suspense indeed and there are moments of sheer terror, escorted by a haunting score, which was just brilliant and added more intensity to these occasions.

This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escapehow we "scratch and claw" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like "in an institution or something". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's "harmless". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go "a little mad sometimes". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable fa&ccedil;ade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one. This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face. To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.

    As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he "Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.

    "Psycho" considered the best movie which has directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I think that's true. "Psycho" left by history and became very famous and it is famous until today. Anthony Perkins interpretation is outstanding as Norman Bates a young man who manages a motel. Janet Leigh made an also great interpretation as Marion Crane a woman who stole $40,000 from the company which worked and run out to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Alfred Hitchcock directs again a masterpiece but this time I think that he did his best with this movie. I think that "Psycho" is the best horror movie of all time and the best movie of Alfred Hitchcock.

    Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest.

    Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to "torture porn". Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking. Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.

    Psycho is the second film I watch from Alfred Hitchcock and it's absolutely stunning. Just like Vertigo, it also contains a very interesting and shocking twist, being one of the most original endings I've seen in a while. Anthony Perkins gives an electrifying performance as Norman Bates and I always found his interactions with the other characters very interesting to see. He manages to be charismatic, awkward and chilling with perfection, being one of the highlights here. Hitchcock is the master of suspense indeed and there are moments of sheer terror, escorted by a haunting score, which was just brilliant and added more intensity to these occasions.

    . . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to "humor" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 "Making of" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a "necessary evil," feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the "Roaring Twenties" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum "cooling off period" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of "being humored" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!

    Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career. Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower. The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters. The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal. Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself "Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene. Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film. Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience. Grade: A+ Rating: 10.5/10

    Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just.....wow.

    This is the movie about psycho killer's story. The main characters are one woman who works at office, her boyfriend, sister, one man who managing a motel, and his mother. It will be interesting that you watch it and guess the killer and why the killer kills victim. I am interested in this movie. It is because when I research this movie, the website said this movie became a forerunner of psycho homicide movie. Then, I saw this movie at the theater (By chance, the movie was shown at one theater). I was so excited about this movie. The scene that policeman and private eye talks about the madder how and who did it is really interesting. I was surprised last scene. I recommend this movie. It is oldest psycho homicide movie. Psycho homicide movies are popular now days. I like kind of this movie. If you also like kind of this movies, you must try to watch it!

    In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation. Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out.

To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of "being humored" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!

    Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career. Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower. The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters. The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal. Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself "Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene. Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film. Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience. Grade: A+ Rating: 10.5/10

    Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just.....wow.

    This is the movie about psycho killer's story. The main characters are one woman who works at office, her boyfriend, sister, one man who managing a motel, and his mother. It will be interesting that you watch it and guess the killer and why the killer kills victim. I am interested in this movie. It is because when I research this movie, the website said this movie became a forerunner of psycho homicide movie. Then, I saw this movie at the theater (By chance, the movie was shown at one theater). I was so excited about this movie. The scene that policeman and private eye talks about the madder how and who did it is really interesting. I was surprised last scene. I recommend this movie. It is oldest psycho homicide movie. Psycho homicide movies are popular now days. I like kind of this movie. If you also like kind of this movies, you must try to watch it!

    In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation. Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escapehow we "scratch and claw" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like "in an institution or something". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's "harmless". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go "a little mad sometimes". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable fa&ccedil;ade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one. This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face. To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.

    As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he "Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.

    "Psycho" considered the best movie which has directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I think that's true. "Psycho" left by history and became very famous and it is famous until today. Anthony Perkins interpretation is outstanding as Norman Bates a young man who manages a motel. Janet Leigh made an also great interpretation as Marion Crane a woman who stole $40,000 from the company which worked and run out to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Alfred Hitchcock directs again a masterpiece but this time I think that he did his best with this movie. I think that "Psycho" is the best horror movie of all time and the best movie of Alfred Hitchcock.

    Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest.

    Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to "torture porn". Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking. Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.

    Psycho is the second film I watch from Alfred Hitchcock and it's absolutely stunning. Just like Vertigo, it also contains a very interesting and shocking twist, being one of the most original endings I've seen in a while. Anthony Perkins gives an electrifying performance as Norman Bates and I always found his interactions with the other characters very interesting to see. He manages to be charismatic, awkward and chilling with perfection, being one of the highlights here. Hitchcock is the master of suspense indeed and there are moments of sheer terror, escorted by a haunting score, which was just brilliant and added more intensity to these occasions.

    . . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to "humor" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 "Making of" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a "necessary evil," feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the "Roaring Twenties" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum "cooling off period" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut.

At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escapehow we "scratch and claw" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like "in an institution or something". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's "harmless". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go "a little mad sometimes". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable fa&ccedil;ade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one. This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face. To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.

    As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he "Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.

    "Psycho" considered the best movie which has directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I think that's true. "Psycho" left by history and became very famous and it is famous until today. Anthony Perkins interpretation is outstanding as Norman Bates a young man who manages a motel. Janet Leigh made an also great interpretation as Marion Crane a woman who stole $40,000 from the company which worked and run out to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Alfred Hitchcock directs again a masterpiece but this time I think that he did his best with this movie. I think that "Psycho" is the best horror movie of all time and the best movie of Alfred Hitchcock.

    Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest.

    Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to "torture porn". Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking. Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.

    Psycho is the second film I watch from Alfred Hitchcock and it's absolutely stunning. Just like Vertigo, it also contains a very interesting and shocking twist, being one of the most original endings I've seen in a while. Anthony Perkins gives an electrifying performance as Norman Bates and I always found his interactions with the other characters very interesting to see. He manages to be charismatic, awkward and chilling with perfection, being one of the highlights here. Hitchcock is the master of suspense indeed and there are moments of sheer terror, escorted by a haunting score, which was just brilliant and added more intensity to these occasions.

    . . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to "humor" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 "Making of" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a "necessary evil," feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the "Roaring Twenties" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum "cooling off period" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of "being humored" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!

    Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career. Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower. The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters. The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal. Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself "Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene. Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film. Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience. Grade: A+ Rating: 10.5/10

    Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just.....wow.

    This is the movie about psycho killer's story. The main characters are one woman who works at office, her boyfriend, sister, one man who managing a motel, and his mother. It will be interesting that you watch it and guess the killer and why the killer kills victim. I am interested in this movie. It is because when I research this movie, the website said this movie became a forerunner of psycho homicide movie. Then, I saw this movie at the theater (By chance, the movie was shown at one theater). I was so excited about this movie. The scene that policeman and private eye talks about the madder how and who did it is really interesting. I was surprised last scene. I recommend this movie. It is oldest psycho homicide movie. Psycho homicide movies are popular now days. I like kind of this movie. If you also like kind of this movies, you must try to watch it!

    In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation. Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escapehow we "scratch and claw" (like a bird) but never to any avail.

However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!

    Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career. Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower. The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters. The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal. Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself "Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene. Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film. Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience. Grade: A+ Rating: 10.5/10

    Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just.....wow.

    This is the movie about psycho killer's story. The main characters are one woman who works at office, her boyfriend, sister, one man who managing a motel, and his mother. It will be interesting that you watch it and guess the killer and why the killer kills victim. I am interested in this movie. It is because when I research this movie, the website said this movie became a forerunner of psycho homicide movie. Then, I saw this movie at the theater (By chance, the movie was shown at one theater). I was so excited about this movie. The scene that policeman and private eye talks about the madder how and who did it is really interesting. I was surprised last scene. I recommend this movie. It is oldest psycho homicide movie. Psycho homicide movies are popular now days. I like kind of this movie. If you also like kind of this movies, you must try to watch it!

    In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation. Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escapehow we "scratch and claw" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like "in an institution or something". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's "harmless". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go "a little mad sometimes". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable fa&ccedil;ade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one. This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face. To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.

    As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he "Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.

    "Psycho" considered the best movie which has directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I think that's true. "Psycho" left by history and became very famous and it is famous until today. Anthony Perkins interpretation is outstanding as Norman Bates a young man who manages a motel. Janet Leigh made an also great interpretation as Marion Crane a woman who stole $40,000 from the company which worked and run out to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Alfred Hitchcock directs again a masterpiece but this time I think that he did his best with this movie. I think that "Psycho" is the best horror movie of all time and the best movie of Alfred Hitchcock.

    Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest.

    Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to "torture porn". Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking. Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.

    Psycho is the second film I watch from Alfred Hitchcock and it's absolutely stunning. Just like Vertigo, it also contains a very interesting and shocking twist, being one of the most original endings I've seen in a while. Anthony Perkins gives an electrifying performance as Norman Bates and I always found his interactions with the other characters very interesting to see. He manages to be charismatic, awkward and chilling with perfection, being one of the highlights here. Hitchcock is the master of suspense indeed and there are moments of sheer terror, escorted by a haunting score, which was just brilliant and added more intensity to these occasions.

    . . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to "humor" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 "Making of" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a "necessary evil," feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the "Roaring Twenties" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum "cooling off period" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of "being humored" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!
