    The pacing of this movie matches the story-line. You can feel it building to a crescendo...the ending is poignant. While Jack Nicholson's character is devolving, on a self-destructive course towards insanity, David Morse's character, on the other hand, is trying to rebuild his life. Guilt is eating both men alive from the inside. Angelica Houston's performance as the ex-wife is spot-on. When she finally opens up to Nicholson at the little cafe at midnite, he is no longer in a receptive mood. He's past the point of no return. The subject matter is heavy. How 2 people...both father and drunk driver...deal with their hate and guilt after the death of the daughter...is not a feel-good movie. But I think it's a subject that many of us have thought about...probably hoping and praying it would never happen to us. Many good performances here. David Morse is amazing as the reformed drunk driver...searching for his lost soul. Priscilla Barnes (from Three's Company) shows up as a stripper, and Nicholson's sometime girlfriend. She is very believable and it's a shame Hollywood typecast her as they did. One can tell from her performance here that she is capable of so much more. All-in-all, a very solid film. Not great, but definitely worth watching.

    Cannot say enough about this film. Never even knew it existed until it popped up on Netflix and I could not believe a Jack Nicholson film existed that I had not watched at least once. Wife and I watched this at home without interruption and really enjoyed it since we both had recently lost parents, friends and our dog, Scooter. But I never thought a movie could blend such emotion , suspense and action in such a way as "The Crossing Guard". And I admit I am quite a movie snob when it comes to quality movies. Just a great movie all around but you do need to be in the mood for a real actor's movie and not looking for a crash bang thing. I would highly recommend for anyone over 16.

    I have to take exception to what seems the be the majority view that this is an excellent film. The whole thing is contrived and phony. Throughout, there are innumerable points in the action where people do things and behave in ways completely contrary to what real people would do. The dialogue, too, is contrived. And one could have asked some more subtlety. As it is, it is clear from the get go that the vengeful father is the "bad" guy and the repentant killer is the "good" guy. Things are rarely so black and white. There is one scene further on in the film where Nicholson's character, in a conversation with his ex-wife, portrays some genuine grief and pain, but his portrayal up to that point completely belies that. And the many observations by viewers about the excessive and gratuitous nudity are on the mark. The completely contrived and unbelievable ending brings to mind Oscar Wilde's quote that "one would have to have a heart of stone not to dissolve into tears ...of laughter." Sean Penn should stick to his day job of acting and stay away from writing and directing.

    Legendary Actor Sean Penn's Criminally Under-Rated 'The Crossing Guard' is an astonishing, powerful Human Story, that leaves a terrific impact. And Acting Epitome, Jack Nicholson, is Mesmerising, as always. 'The Crossing Guard' Synopsis: Freddie Gale is a seedy jeweler who has sworn to kill the drunk driver who killed his little girl. 'The Crossing Guard' is unsettling, disturbing & dark. And that is its biggest victory, it treats this difficult Human Story with proper treatment & detailed execution. Penn's Screenplay & Direction, both, are exemplary. He has handled the film with majestic treatment & magnetic understanding. He's at the top of his game in here! Performance-Wise: Nicholson is mesmerizing. His performance as a father who's daughter was killed, is heartbreaking. Watch his breakdown sequence when he calls up his ex-wife, its haunting. Nicholson is an unmatchable, impeccable, flawless performer who's way above of any award. Anjelica Huston plays Nicholson's ex-wife & she's stunning. David Morse as the culprit, is extremely subdued & restrained. A graceful performance. Robin Wright Penn is efficient. On the whole, 'The Crossing Guard' is an astonishing cinematic achievement. Don't Miss It!

    Jack Nicholson stars as a man who lost his daughter five years ago to a drunk driver. The driver (David Morse) is just now getting out of prison, and Nicholson has sworn that he will kill the man. That's pretty much the entire set-up. There really isn't much plot to the film - it's just a contemplative look at two lost souls as they struggle to get on with their lives. Many seem to find it boring. I thought it was quite powerful, though it doesn't work 100% of the time. Nicholson's performance is uneven - he has a lot of good to great scenes, but there are times when he overacts, as well. Morse is the stronger of the two main performers - he's absolutely outstanding. Anjelica Huston is also strong as Nicholson's ex-wife - she's dealt with her pain much more healthily than Nicholson has, and she tries to talk him out of it (notably, though, she never informs the police of his plans, though, frankly, from what I know of her character I don't find it believable that she wouldn't). Huston was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globes. Robin Wright (before she hyphenated her last name) also co-stars as Morse's love interest. She doesn't have much to do, but she does do a sexy dance to Salt 'n Pepa's "Whatta Man". Penn's direction is quite great, as is the editing. It is a little slow, and there are a few bits that don't work (most involve Nicholson overacting), but I really liked it.

    Unhappily divorced jeweler Jack Nicholson (as Freddy Gale) learns the drunk driver held responsible for the death of his daughter has been released from prison. Swearing and shouting, Mr. Nicholson visits his happily re-married wife Anjelica Huston (as Mary) and announces he intends to kill newly free, but guilt-ridden David Morse (as John Booth). Nicholson finds Mr. Morse living in a trailer on his parents' property and aims his gun - but the weapon malfunctions. Nicholson's verbal blue-streak wakes Morse from his sleep. Morse asks for two, but Nicholson gives him three days to live. By then, that gun should be fixed... Morse admits, "It only hurts the first time," when describing his sexual activity in prison, then he hooks up with beautiful Robin Wright (as Jojo). She will hook up with writer/director Sean Penn, behind-the-scenes... Nicholson's Freddy continues to get drunk and pick-up arousing strippers. There is an eye-opening look at topless Pricilla Barnes (as Verna), who holds up well against the younger beauties. After the three days, Nicholson goes to kill Morse again. There is irony in the fact that Nicholson is most likely a drunk driver who wasn't as unlucky as the one who struck down his daughter. This is obvious from the beginning, but it may be intended as a big reveal. There are big, competent names attached to "The Crossing Guard" who are big and competent throughout; yet, you may never completely forget who they are and what you're watching. ****** The Crossing Guard (9/10/95) Sean Penn ~ Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Robin Wright, Anjelica Huston

    The daughter of Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson) was killed in an accident by John Booth (David Morse). The death of his child took a tool on Freddy, as his marriage broke up and he became an alcoholic, looking for a purpose in his life. Freddy plans to kill Booth as soon as he's released from prison, as he thinks, that the jail sentence is not enough punishment for the death of his daughter. He tells Booth, that he has three days to live. The movie is a mixture of thrill and sadness for the two man who, are connected by the unbelievable tragedy, although for different reasons. An expressive role of a big star Jack Nicholson with an expected final. Pleasant story by writer and director, Sean Penn.

    The opening to Sean Penn's directorial debut tees up its overall thesis of grief, or the studying of various ways of grieving, with a glimpse into that of a group counselling session driven at this point by a woman speaking of the death of her younger brother. She admits that she feels as if she will never again want to feel affectionate towards a human-being as much as she did her brother, for the fear born out of further loss, in what is a revealing and frank monologue of sorts on the issue. It is an instance in which somebody exposes some deeply rooted emotions out of the death of a loved one, Penn's film, The Crossing Guard, branching out into a fascinating and far broader play on the subject allowing actions and highly strung mindsets to drive a look at anguish, a film covering an array of people of grossly differing ilks suffering in some form due to a fatality; the likes of which are an affecting mediation that doubles up as a somewhat gripping tale of revenge that is never exploitative nor dunderheaded, and indeed remains constantly engrossing to its affecting finale. Penn's film is an engrossing low-key drama observing some rather high-key feelings of consciousness, a film with a creative and personal stamp all over it; principally, a film which looks at those on opposite sides of the death of a young girl at the hands of a drunk-driving incident and revolves a subversive nucleus around a number of sub-plots contributing to an overall thesis. One of these individuals is Jack Nicholson's Freddy Gale; a man, whose daughter is Emily and who was killed in that driving incident five years ago, whom is initially revealed as someone combating whatever grief he experiences by frequenting strip clubs so as to meet with his equally sleazy colleagues and which usually leads to the spending of a night with one of the performers. Freddy is the guy we're inclined towards siding with out of victimisation, but he is, in actual fact, a sleazy and unlikeable individual; with the perpetrator of the death coming across as a little bit more than the faceless, drink driving murderer we're, again, naturally inclined towards labelling as such. It's not as if we feel Freddy doesn't care, indeed he has the anniversary of his daughter's death vehemently stencilled in on his calender; while his clinicalness is exemplified in his dealing with a minute employee issue early on at his jewellers in an effective and shrewed manner. Freddy's lifestyle acts as something to sooth the pain, since his ex-wife, in Anjelica Huston's Mary, is seen during that opening therapy session born out of Emily's death; Penn cutting back and forth from such sequences at such places juxtaposing the content and alluding to a harsh duality in dealing with grief. The turntable which will unsettle the balance in each of these people's lives arrives in the form of David Morse's John Booth, the man who was responsible for Emily's death and is now out of prison after his stretch for it. You always feel that a genre piece would demand a man of such a nature be collected by a former criminal cohort or something in the region of; here, Booth is picked up by his parents, and he appears humble enough - speaking of the problems he experienced whilst incarcerated and appearing to have a good rapport with his folks. Indeed, his parents seem like gentle folk and still connect with each other at the age they're at, a far cry from Freddy and Mary on the other strand who're a lot younger but much further apart. Freddy, blinded by some vengeful rage, as well as the seemingly still prominent escalating need to prove his masculinity following the decimation of his marriage, and after so much time spent with women and in those specific locales with other men, tracks Booth with the intent to kill him. The men reach a compromise that sees Booth suggest he come back to his trailer-home in three days time to challenge him if he still wants blood to be spilt. Interestingly, this causes Freddy to go home and make an even larger stencil mark on his calender than that of the anniversary's date; an alluding to the hierarchical element to which date, as well as the actions predestined to be either acknowledged or carried out on such dates, acts as more important to him. Penn's film is one of a revenge ilk in which a lead reckons to grab the nearest firearm and hulk out to get some revenge so as to compensate for a lost or taken loved one; its substance in identifying that as a premise commonly used to drive such films as Commando or Rambo III, and allowing that respective denouement to occur in the first third, crucial to permitting the involved parties to play out what is from there on in an engrossing mediation on revenge; grief and guilt which ought not slip beneath one's radar.

    "Too slow!" "So boring!" "Why the heck is it called 'The Crossing Guard?'" I wonder how many viewers of The Crossing Guard (TCG) said such things because they viewed the same DVD edition I watched. I read the back of the DVD box afterwards, and I had to laugh. It seems to have been produced by people who have no idea what the movie's about. The box's lurid, breathless text markets this as an "action thriller", and makes it sound like a "Death Wish" or "High Noon" revenge showdown! A featured photo shows Freddy swingin' the chair. Although TCG revolves around revenge, and a gun features prominently, you almost won't know it. TCG is what you'd call a "literate drama." The revenge Freddy plans to exact is the story's driving force, but the bulk of the plot is character study and psychological drama, its two feet very much on the ground. Unlike some literate dramas -- ponderous, pretentious attempts at art, with static filming to match -- TCG has the goods. It's a sensitive, curious examination of a difficult main character and real-life subject matter. Since TCG gets quite disturbing at times, not least of all because of its broken, volatile, oft-unlikable protagonist, watching can be a challenge, but nonetheless it's refreshing to watch a complicated drama that doesn't push saccharine messages or pretend to have easy answers. It simply lets its characters loose to find their own way through a rather open-ended plot, and never loses sight of their humanity even while it acknowledges their awful acts. Stick with TCG and it will prove to be a rewarding film with both a mind and heart. The literary genre's artsiness and realismo -- "true-to-life" folks who are quirky but not really funny, half-heard scraps of conversation -- create a few annoying bits in TCG, but not enough to damage the proceedings. Bobby's long speech at the survivor's support group reflects the reality of inarticulate people who can't speak from a polished script, but it doesn't do much for the film. You'll just have to chuckle through TCG's candle-strewn "artists' party," of which only 10% of the dialogue makes a lick of sense. I admit that the John-Jojo relationship and pectoral-clutching push credibility. A better literate aspect in TCG is its humor, a pleasant surprise, especially coming from a writer/director better known for being humorless. When Freddy, falling apart from his rage, suddenly accepts the crowd's plea to join Mia the stripper on stage for a pole dance, it's remarkable, tense black comedy. Even better is when Freddy goes home with Mia, who surprises him by performing (and supposedly composing) a song for Freddy on her synthesizer decked out with blinking lights. Freddy just sits and watches in a stupor; whether it's from his booze or the music show is uncertain. In a Hitchcockian touch, a violent chase by foot detours into a city bus, and the participants must deal with bus fares, mistakes about the stops, and bickering passengers.

    I really don't understand why this movie didn't go further. I'm really missing the point of view of the negative voters and commenters. They all seem so harsh and cold. This movie should be FLOODED with emotional viewers and reviewers! Penn proved his chops as both writer and director here. You don't get these actors doing such a great job without great writing and directing, no matter who they are. You have to get the movie as a vehicle for the last minute of the film. You have to give the movie enough time-rope and attention-rope to let it hang you at the end. This is a punchline movie and you have to be the kind of person who is willing to be punched. You have to not get captured in Freddy's negativity. It's part of the setup. His lifestyle, part of the setup. Booth's flatness of affect, part of the setup. Just sit back, register it, allow yourself to be set up by it. Give it the time the movie deserves And let yourself get sweetly punched and redeemed at the end. I once had a friend who said they Hated Pulp Fiction. Near the end of the pawnshop scene she was cheering "get him, kill him" After, she said she hated it. She got SO involved with the movie and the characterizations that the hated to be so manipulated. She loved the movie, but she didn't know it.

    The opening to Sean Penn's directorial debut tees up its overall thesis of grief, or the studying of various ways of grieving, with a glimpse into that of a group counselling session driven at this point by a woman speaking of the death of her younger brother. She admits that she feels as if she will never again want to feel affectionate towards a human-being as much as she did her brother, for the fear born out of further loss, in what is a revealing and frank monologue of sorts on the issue. It is an instance in which somebody exposes some deeply rooted emotions out of the death of a loved one, Penn's film, The Crossing Guard, branching out into a fascinating and far broader play on the subject allowing actions and highly strung mindsets to drive a look at anguish, a film covering an array of people of grossly differing ilks suffering in some form due to a fatality; the likes of which are an affecting mediation that doubles up as a somewhat gripping tale of revenge that is never exploitative nor dunderheaded, and indeed remains constantly engrossing to its affecting finale. Penn's film is an engrossing low-key drama observing some rather high-key feelings of consciousness, a film with a creative and personal stamp all over it; principally, a film which looks at those on opposite sides of the death of a young girl at the hands of a drunk-driving incident and revolves a subversive nucleus around a number of sub-plots contributing to an overall thesis. One of these individuals is Jack Nicholson's Freddy Gale; a man, whose daughter is Emily and who was killed in that driving incident five years ago, whom is initially revealed as someone combating whatever grief he experiences by frequenting strip clubs so as to meet with his equally sleazy colleagues and which usually leads to the spending of a night with one of the performers. Freddy is the guy we're inclined towards siding with out of victimisation, but he is, in actual fact, a sleazy and unlikeable individual; with the perpetrator of the death coming across as a little bit more than the faceless, drink driving murderer we're, again, naturally inclined towards labelling as such. It's not as if we feel Freddy doesn't care, indeed he has the anniversary of his daughter's death vehemently stencilled in on his calender; while his clinicalness is exemplified in his dealing with a minute employee issue early on at his jewellers in an effective and shrewed manner. Freddy's lifestyle acts as something to sooth the pain, since his ex-wife, in Anjelica Huston's Mary, is seen during that opening therapy session born out of Emily's death; Penn cutting back and forth from such sequences at such places juxtaposing the content and alluding to a harsh duality in dealing with grief. The turntable which will unsettle the balance in each of these people's lives arrives in the form of David Morse's John Booth, the man who was responsible for Emily's death and is now out of prison after his stretch for it. You always feel that a genre piece would demand a man of such a nature be collected by a former criminal cohort or something in the region of; here, Booth is picked up by his parents, and he appears humble enough - speaking of the problems he experienced whilst incarcerated and appearing to have a good rapport with his folks. Indeed, his parents seem like gentle folk and still connect with each other at the age they're at, a far cry from Freddy and Mary on the other strand who're a lot younger but much further apart. Freddy, blinded by some vengeful rage, as well as the seemingly still prominent escalating need to prove his masculinity following the decimation of his marriage, and after so much time spent with women and in those specific locales with other men, tracks Booth with the intent to kill him. The men reach a compromise that sees Booth suggest he come back to his trailer-home in three days time to challenge him if he still wants blood to be spilt. Interestingly, this causes Freddy to go home and make an even larger stencil mark on his calender than that of the anniversary's date; an alluding to the hierarchical element to which date, as well as the actions predestined to be either acknowledged or carried out on such dates, acts as more important to him. Penn's film is one of a revenge ilk in which a lead reckons to grab the nearest firearm and hulk out to get some revenge so as to compensate for a lost or taken loved one; its substance in identifying that as a premise commonly used to drive such films as Commando or Rambo III, and allowing that respective denouement to occur in the first third, crucial to permitting the involved parties to play out what is from there on in an engrossing mediation on revenge; grief and guilt which ought not slip beneath one's radar.

    "Too slow!" "So boring!" "Why the heck is it called 'The Crossing Guard?'" I wonder how many viewers of The Crossing Guard (TCG) said such things because they viewed the same DVD edition I watched. I read the back of the DVD box afterwards, and I had to laugh. It seems to have been produced by people who have no idea what the movie's about. The box's lurid, breathless text markets this as an "action thriller", and makes it sound like a "Death Wish" or "High Noon" revenge showdown! A featured photo shows Freddy swingin' the chair. Although TCG revolves around revenge, and a gun features prominently, you almost won't know it. TCG is what you'd call a "literate drama." The revenge Freddy plans to exact is the story's driving force, but the bulk of the plot is character study and psychological drama, its two feet very much on the ground. Unlike some literate dramas -- ponderous, pretentious attempts at art, with static filming to match -- TCG has the goods. It's a sensitive, curious examination of a difficult main character and real-life subject matter. Since TCG gets quite disturbing at times, not least of all because of its broken, volatile, oft-unlikable protagonist, watching can be a challenge, but nonetheless it's refreshing to watch a complicated drama that doesn't push saccharine messages or pretend to have easy answers. It simply lets its characters loose to find their own way through a rather open-ended plot, and never loses sight of their humanity even while it acknowledges their awful acts. Stick with TCG and it will prove to be a rewarding film with both a mind and heart. The literary genre's artsiness and realismo -- "true-to-life" folks who are quirky but not really funny, half-heard scraps of conversation -- create a few annoying bits in TCG, but not enough to damage the proceedings. Bobby's long speech at the survivor's support group reflects the reality of inarticulate people who can't speak from a polished script, but it doesn't do much for the film. You'll just have to chuckle through TCG's candle-strewn "artists' party," of which only 10% of the dialogue makes a lick of sense. I admit that the John-Jojo relationship and pectoral-clutching push credibility. A better literate aspect in TCG is its humor, a pleasant surprise, especially coming from a writer/director better known for being humorless. When Freddy, falling apart from his rage, suddenly accepts the crowd's plea to join Mia the stripper on stage for a pole dance, it's remarkable, tense black comedy. Even better is when Freddy goes home with Mia, who surprises him by performing (and supposedly composing) a song for Freddy on her synthesizer decked out with blinking lights. Freddy just sits and watches in a stupor; whether it's from his booze or the music show is uncertain. In a Hitchcockian touch, a violent chase by foot detours into a city bus, and the participants must deal with bus fares, mistakes about the stops, and bickering passengers.

    I really don't understand why this movie didn't go further. I'm really missing the point of view of the negative voters and commenters. They all seem so harsh and cold. This movie should be FLOODED with emotional viewers and reviewers! Penn proved his chops as both writer and director here. You don't get these actors doing such a great job without great writing and directing, no matter who they are. You have to get the movie as a vehicle for the last minute of the film. You have to give the movie enough time-rope and attention-rope to let it hang you at the end. This is a punchline movie and you have to be the kind of person who is willing to be punched. You have to not get captured in Freddy's negativity. It's part of the setup. His lifestyle, part of the setup. Booth's flatness of affect, part of the setup. Just sit back, register it, allow yourself to be set up by it. Give it the time the movie deserves And let yourself get sweetly punched and redeemed at the end. I once had a friend who said they Hated Pulp Fiction. Near the end of the pawnshop scene she was cheering "get him, kill him" After, she said she hated it. She got SO involved with the movie and the characterizations that the hated to be so manipulated. She loved the movie, but she didn't know it.

    The pacing of this movie matches the story-line. You can feel it building to a crescendo...the ending is poignant. While Jack Nicholson's character is devolving, on a self-destructive course towards insanity, David Morse's character, on the other hand, is trying to rebuild his life. Guilt is eating both men alive from the inside. Angelica Houston's performance as the ex-wife is spot-on. When she finally opens up to Nicholson at the little cafe at midnite, he is no longer in a receptive mood. He's past the point of no return. The subject matter is heavy. How 2 people...both father and drunk driver...deal with their hate and guilt after the death of the daughter...is not a feel-good movie. But I think it's a subject that many of us have thought about...probably hoping and praying it would never happen to us. Many good performances here. David Morse is amazing as the reformed drunk driver...searching for his lost soul. Priscilla Barnes (from Three's Company) shows up as a stripper, and Nicholson's sometime girlfriend. She is very believable and it's a shame Hollywood typecast her as they did. One can tell from her performance here that she is capable of so much more. All-in-all, a very solid film. Not great, but definitely worth watching.

    Cannot say enough about this film. Never even knew it existed until it popped up on Netflix and I could not believe a Jack Nicholson film existed that I had not watched at least once. Wife and I watched this at home without interruption and really enjoyed it since we both had recently lost parents, friends and our dog, Scooter. But I never thought a movie could blend such emotion , suspense and action in such a way as "The Crossing Guard". And I admit I am quite a movie snob when it comes to quality movies. Just a great movie all around but you do need to be in the mood for a real actor's movie and not looking for a crash bang thing. I would highly recommend for anyone over 16.

    I have to take exception to what seems the be the majority view that this is an excellent film. The whole thing is contrived and phony. Throughout, there are innumerable points in the action where people do things and behave in ways completely contrary to what real people would do. The dialogue, too, is contrived. And one could have asked some more subtlety. As it is, it is clear from the get go that the vengeful father is the "bad" guy and the repentant killer is the "good" guy. Things are rarely so black and white. There is one scene further on in the film where Nicholson's character, in a conversation with his ex-wife, portrays some genuine grief and pain, but his portrayal up to that point completely belies that. And the many observations by viewers about the excessive and gratuitous nudity are on the mark. The completely contrived and unbelievable ending brings to mind Oscar Wilde's quote that "one would have to have a heart of stone not to dissolve into tears ...of laughter." Sean Penn should stick to his day job of acting and stay away from writing and directing.

    Legendary Actor Sean Penn's Criminally Under-Rated 'The Crossing Guard' is an astonishing, powerful Human Story, that leaves a terrific impact. And Acting Epitome, Jack Nicholson, is Mesmerising, as always. 'The Crossing Guard' Synopsis: Freddie Gale is a seedy jeweler who has sworn to kill the drunk driver who killed his little girl. 'The Crossing Guard' is unsettling, disturbing & dark. And that is its biggest victory, it treats this difficult Human Story with proper treatment & detailed execution. Penn's Screenplay & Direction, both, are exemplary. He has handled the film with majestic treatment & magnetic understanding. He's at the top of his game in here! Performance-Wise: Nicholson is mesmerizing. His performance as a father who's daughter was killed, is heartbreaking. Watch his breakdown sequence when he calls up his ex-wife, its haunting. Nicholson is an unmatchable, impeccable, flawless performer who's way above of any award. Anjelica Huston plays Nicholson's ex-wife & she's stunning. David Morse as the culprit, is extremely subdued & restrained. A graceful performance. Robin Wright Penn is efficient. On the whole, 'The Crossing Guard' is an astonishing cinematic achievement. Don't Miss It!

    Jack Nicholson stars as a man who lost his daughter five years ago to a drunk driver. The driver (David Morse) is just now getting out of prison, and Nicholson has sworn that he will kill the man. That's pretty much the entire set-up. There really isn't much plot to the film - it's just a contemplative look at two lost souls as they struggle to get on with their lives. Many seem to find it boring. I thought it was quite powerful, though it doesn't work 100% of the time. Nicholson's performance is uneven - he has a lot of good to great scenes, but there are times when he overacts, as well. Morse is the stronger of the two main performers - he's absolutely outstanding. Anjelica Huston is also strong as Nicholson's ex-wife - she's dealt with her pain much more healthily than Nicholson has, and she tries to talk him out of it (notably, though, she never informs the police of his plans, though, frankly, from what I know of her character I don't find it believable that she wouldn't). Huston was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globes. Robin Wright (before she hyphenated her last name) also co-stars as Morse's love interest. She doesn't have much to do, but she does do a sexy dance to Salt 'n Pepa's "Whatta Man". Penn's direction is quite great, as is the editing. It is a little slow, and there are a few bits that don't work (most involve Nicholson overacting), but I really liked it.

    Unhappily divorced jeweler Jack Nicholson (as Freddy Gale) learns the drunk driver held responsible for the death of his daughter has been released from prison. Swearing and shouting, Mr. Nicholson visits his happily re-married wife Anjelica Huston (as Mary) and announces he intends to kill newly free, but guilt-ridden David Morse (as John Booth). Nicholson finds Mr. Morse living in a trailer on his parents' property and aims his gun - but the weapon malfunctions. Nicholson's verbal blue-streak wakes Morse from his sleep. Morse asks for two, but Nicholson gives him three days to live. By then, that gun should be fixed... Morse admits, "It only hurts the first time," when describing his sexual activity in prison, then he hooks up with beautiful Robin Wright (as Jojo). She will hook up with writer/director Sean Penn, behind-the-scenes... Nicholson's Freddy continues to get drunk and pick-up arousing strippers. There is an eye-opening look at topless Pricilla Barnes (as Verna), who holds up well against the younger beauties. After the three days, Nicholson goes to kill Morse again. There is irony in the fact that Nicholson is most likely a drunk driver who wasn't as unlucky as the one who struck down his daughter. This is obvious from the beginning, but it may be intended as a big reveal. There are big, competent names attached to "The Crossing Guard" who are big and competent throughout; yet, you may never completely forget who they are and what you're watching. ****** The Crossing Guard (9/10/95) Sean Penn ~ Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Robin Wright, Anjelica Huston

    The daughter of Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson) was killed in an accident by John Booth (David Morse). The death of his child took a tool on Freddy, as his marriage broke up and he became an alcoholic, looking for a purpose in his life. Freddy plans to kill Booth as soon as he's released from prison, as he thinks, that the jail sentence is not enough punishment for the death of his daughter. He tells Booth, that he has three days to live. The movie is a mixture of thrill and sadness for the two man who, are connected by the unbelievable tragedy, although for different reasons. An expressive role of a big star Jack Nicholson with an expected final. Pleasant story by writer and director, Sean Penn.

    I have to take exception to what seems the be the majority view that this is an excellent film. The whole thing is contrived and phony. Throughout, there are innumerable points in the action where people do things and behave in ways completely contrary to what real people would do. The dialogue, too, is contrived. And one could have asked some more subtlety. As it is, it is clear from the get go that the vengeful father is the "bad" guy and the repentant killer is the "good" guy. Things are rarely so black and white. There is one scene further on in the film where Nicholson's character, in a conversation with his ex-wife, portrays some genuine grief and pain, but his portrayal up to that point completely belies that. And the many observations by viewers about the excessive and gratuitous nudity are on the mark. The completely contrived and unbelievable ending brings to mind Oscar Wilde's quote that "one would have to have a heart of stone not to dissolve into tears ...of laughter." Sean Penn should stick to his day job of acting and stay away from writing and directing.

    Legendary Actor Sean Penn's Criminally Under-Rated 'The Crossing Guard' is an astonishing, powerful Human Story, that leaves a terrific impact. And Acting Epitome, Jack Nicholson, is Mesmerising, as always. 'The Crossing Guard' Synopsis: Freddie Gale is a seedy jeweler who has sworn to kill the drunk driver who killed his little girl. 'The Crossing Guard' is unsettling, disturbing & dark. And that is its biggest victory, it treats this difficult Human Story with proper treatment & detailed execution. Penn's Screenplay & Direction, both, are exemplary. He has handled the film with majestic treatment & magnetic understanding. He's at the top of his game in here! Performance-Wise: Nicholson is mesmerizing. His performance as a father who's daughter was killed, is heartbreaking. Watch his breakdown sequence when he calls up his ex-wife, its haunting. Nicholson is an unmatchable, impeccable, flawless performer who's way above of any award. Anjelica Huston plays Nicholson's ex-wife & she's stunning. David Morse as the culprit, is extremely subdued & restrained. A graceful performance. Robin Wright Penn is efficient. On the whole, 'The Crossing Guard' is an astonishing cinematic achievement. Don't Miss It!

    Jack Nicholson stars as a man who lost his daughter five years ago to a drunk driver. The driver (David Morse) is just now getting out of prison, and Nicholson has sworn that he will kill the man. That's pretty much the entire set-up. There really isn't much plot to the film - it's just a contemplative look at two lost souls as they struggle to get on with their lives. Many seem to find it boring. I thought it was quite powerful, though it doesn't work 100% of the time. Nicholson's performance is uneven - he has a lot of good to great scenes, but there are times when he overacts, as well. Morse is the stronger of the two main performers - he's absolutely outstanding. Anjelica Huston is also strong as Nicholson's ex-wife - she's dealt with her pain much more healthily than Nicholson has, and she tries to talk him out of it (notably, though, she never informs the police of his plans, though, frankly, from what I know of her character I don't find it believable that she wouldn't). Huston was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globes. Robin Wright (before she hyphenated her last name) also co-stars as Morse's love interest. She doesn't have much to do, but she does do a sexy dance to Salt 'n Pepa's "Whatta Man". Penn's direction is quite great, as is the editing. It is a little slow, and there are a few bits that don't work (most involve Nicholson overacting), but I really liked it.

    Unhappily divorced jeweler Jack Nicholson (as Freddy Gale) learns the drunk driver held responsible for the death of his daughter has been released from prison. Swearing and shouting, Mr. Nicholson visits his happily re-married wife Anjelica Huston (as Mary) and announces he intends to kill newly free, but guilt-ridden David Morse (as John Booth). Nicholson finds Mr. Morse living in a trailer on his parents' property and aims his gun - but the weapon malfunctions. Nicholson's verbal blue-streak wakes Morse from his sleep. Morse asks for two, but Nicholson gives him three days to live. By then, that gun should be fixed... Morse admits, "It only hurts the first time," when describing his sexual activity in prison, then he hooks up with beautiful Robin Wright (as Jojo). She will hook up with writer/director Sean Penn, behind-the-scenes... Nicholson's Freddy continues to get drunk and pick-up arousing strippers. There is an eye-opening look at topless Pricilla Barnes (as Verna), who holds up well against the younger beauties. After the three days, Nicholson goes to kill Morse again. There is irony in the fact that Nicholson is most likely a drunk driver who wasn't as unlucky as the one who struck down his daughter. This is obvious from the beginning, but it may be intended as a big reveal. There are big, competent names attached to "The Crossing Guard" who are big and competent throughout; yet, you may never completely forget who they are and what you're watching. ****** The Crossing Guard (9/10/95) Sean Penn ~ Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Robin Wright, Anjelica Huston

    The daughter of Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson) was killed in an accident by John Booth (David Morse). The death of his child took a tool on Freddy, as his marriage broke up and he became an alcoholic, looking for a purpose in his life. Freddy plans to kill Booth as soon as he's released from prison, as he thinks, that the jail sentence is not enough punishment for the death of his daughter. He tells Booth, that he has three days to live. The movie is a mixture of thrill and sadness for the two man who, are connected by the unbelievable tragedy, although for different reasons. An expressive role of a big star Jack Nicholson with an expected final. Pleasant story by writer and director, Sean Penn.

    The opening to Sean Penn's directorial debut tees up its overall thesis of grief, or the studying of various ways of grieving, with a glimpse into that of a group counselling session driven at this point by a woman speaking of the death of her younger brother. She admits that she feels as if she will never again want to feel affectionate towards a human-being as much as she did her brother, for the fear born out of further loss, in what is a revealing and frank monologue of sorts on the issue. It is an instance in which somebody exposes some deeply rooted emotions out of the death of a loved one, Penn's film, The Crossing Guard, branching out into a fascinating and far broader play on the subject allowing actions and highly strung mindsets to drive a look at anguish, a film covering an array of people of grossly differing ilks suffering in some form due to a fatality; the likes of which are an affecting mediation that doubles up as a somewhat gripping tale of revenge that is never exploitative nor dunderheaded, and indeed remains constantly engrossing to its affecting finale. Penn's film is an engrossing low-key drama observing some rather high-key feelings of consciousness, a film with a creative and personal stamp all over it; principally, a film which looks at those on opposite sides of the death of a young girl at the hands of a drunk-driving incident and revolves a subversive nucleus around a number of sub-plots contributing to an overall thesis. One of these individuals is Jack Nicholson's Freddy Gale; a man, whose daughter is Emily and who was killed in that driving incident five years ago, whom is initially revealed as someone combating whatever grief he experiences by frequenting strip clubs so as to meet with his equally sleazy colleagues and which usually leads to the spending of a night with one of the performers. Freddy is the guy we're inclined towards siding with out of victimisation, but he is, in actual fact, a sleazy and unlikeable individual; with the perpetrator of the death coming across as a little bit more than the faceless, drink driving murderer we're, again, naturally inclined towards labelling as such. It's not as if we feel Freddy doesn't care, indeed he has the anniversary of his daughter's death vehemently stencilled in on his calender; while his clinicalness is exemplified in his dealing with a minute employee issue early on at his jewellers in an effective and shrewed manner. Freddy's lifestyle acts as something to sooth the pain, since his ex-wife, in Anjelica Huston's Mary, is seen during that opening therapy session born out of Emily's death; Penn cutting back and forth from such sequences at such places juxtaposing the content and alluding to a harsh duality in dealing with grief. The turntable which will unsettle the balance in each of these people's lives arrives in the form of David Morse's John Booth, the man who was responsible for Emily's death and is now out of prison after his stretch for it. You always feel that a genre piece would demand a man of such a nature be collected by a former criminal cohort or something in the region of; here, Booth is picked up by his parents, and he appears humble enough - speaking of the problems he experienced whilst incarcerated and appearing to have a good rapport with his folks. Indeed, his parents seem like gentle folk and still connect with each other at the age they're at, a far cry from Freddy and Mary on the other strand who're a lot younger but much further apart. Freddy, blinded by some vengeful rage, as well as the seemingly still prominent escalating need to prove his masculinity following the decimation of his marriage, and after so much time spent with women and in those specific locales with other men, tracks Booth with the intent to kill him. The men reach a compromise that sees Booth suggest he come back to his trailer-home in three days time to challenge him if he still wants blood to be spilt. Interestingly, this causes Freddy to go home and make an even larger stencil mark on his calender than that of the anniversary's date; an alluding to the hierarchical element to which date, as well as the actions predestined to be either acknowledged or carried out on such dates, acts as more important to him. Penn's film is one of a revenge ilk in which a lead reckons to grab the nearest firearm and hulk out to get some revenge so as to compensate for a lost or taken loved one; its substance in identifying that as a premise commonly used to drive such films as Commando or Rambo III, and allowing that respective denouement to occur in the first third, crucial to permitting the involved parties to play out what is from there on in an engrossing mediation on revenge; grief and guilt which ought not slip beneath one's radar.

    "Too slow!" "So boring!" "Why the heck is it called 'The Crossing Guard?'" I wonder how many viewers of The Crossing Guard (TCG) said such things because they viewed the same DVD edition I watched. I read the back of the DVD box afterwards, and I had to laugh. It seems to have been produced by people who have no idea what the movie's about. The box's lurid, breathless text markets this as an "action thriller", and makes it sound like a "Death Wish" or "High Noon" revenge showdown! A featured photo shows Freddy swingin' the chair. Although TCG revolves around revenge, and a gun features prominently, you almost won't know it. TCG is what you'd call a "literate drama." The revenge Freddy plans to exact is the story's driving force, but the bulk of the plot is character study and psychological drama, its two feet very much on the ground. Unlike some literate dramas -- ponderous, pretentious attempts at art, with static filming to match -- TCG has the goods. It's a sensitive, curious examination of a difficult main character and real-life subject matter. Since TCG gets quite disturbing at times, not least of all because of its broken, volatile, oft-unlikable protagonist, watching can be a challenge, but nonetheless it's refreshing to watch a complicated drama that doesn't push saccharine messages or pretend to have easy answers. It simply lets its characters loose to find their own way through a rather open-ended plot, and never loses sight of their humanity even while it acknowledges their awful acts. Stick with TCG and it will prove to be a rewarding film with both a mind and heart. The literary genre's artsiness and realismo -- "true-to-life" folks who are quirky but not really funny, half-heard scraps of conversation -- create a few annoying bits in TCG, but not enough to damage the proceedings. Bobby's long speech at the survivor's support group reflects the reality of inarticulate people who can't speak from a polished script, but it doesn't do much for the film. You'll just have to chuckle through TCG's candle-strewn "artists' party," of which only 10% of the dialogue makes a lick of sense. I admit that the John-Jojo relationship and pectoral-clutching push credibility. A better literate aspect in TCG is its humor, a pleasant surprise, especially coming from a writer/director better known for being humorless. When Freddy, falling apart from his rage, suddenly accepts the crowd's plea to join Mia the stripper on stage for a pole dance, it's remarkable, tense black comedy. Even better is when Freddy goes home with Mia, who surprises him by performing (and supposedly composing) a song for Freddy on her synthesizer decked out with blinking lights. Freddy just sits and watches in a stupor; whether it's from his booze or the music show is uncertain. In a Hitchcockian touch, a violent chase by foot detours into a city bus, and the participants must deal with bus fares, mistakes about the stops, and bickering passengers.

    I really don't understand why this movie didn't go further. I'm really missing the point of view of the negative voters and commenters. They all seem so harsh and cold. This movie should be FLOODED with emotional viewers and reviewers! Penn proved his chops as both writer and director here. You don't get these actors doing such a great job without great writing and directing, no matter who they are. You have to get the movie as a vehicle for the last minute of the film. You have to give the movie enough time-rope and attention-rope to let it hang you at the end. This is a punchline movie and you have to be the kind of person who is willing to be punched. You have to not get captured in Freddy's negativity. It's part of the setup. His lifestyle, part of the setup. Booth's flatness of affect, part of the setup. Just sit back, register it, allow yourself to be set up by it. Give it the time the movie deserves And let yourself get sweetly punched and redeemed at the end. I once had a friend who said they Hated Pulp Fiction. Near the end of the pawnshop scene she was cheering "get him, kill him" After, she said she hated it. She got SO involved with the movie and the characterizations that the hated to be so manipulated. She loved the movie, but she didn't know it.

    The pacing of this movie matches the story-line. You can feel it building to a crescendo...the ending is poignant. While Jack Nicholson's character is devolving, on a self-destructive course towards insanity, David Morse's character, on the other hand, is trying to rebuild his life. Guilt is eating both men alive from the inside. Angelica Houston's performance as the ex-wife is spot-on. When she finally opens up to Nicholson at the little cafe at midnite, he is no longer in a receptive mood. He's past the point of no return. The subject matter is heavy. How 2 people...both father and drunk driver...deal with their hate and guilt after the death of the daughter...is not a feel-good movie. But I think it's a subject that many of us have thought about...probably hoping and praying it would never happen to us. Many good performances here. David Morse is amazing as the reformed drunk driver...searching for his lost soul. Priscilla Barnes (from Three's Company) shows up as a stripper, and Nicholson's sometime girlfriend. She is very believable and it's a shame Hollywood typecast her as they did. One can tell from her performance here that she is capable of so much more. All-in-all, a very solid film. Not great, but definitely worth watching.

    Cannot say enough about this film. Never even knew it existed until it popped up on Netflix and I could not believe a Jack Nicholson film existed that I had not watched at least once. Wife and I watched this at home without interruption and really enjoyed it since we both had recently lost parents, friends and our dog, Scooter. But I never thought a movie could blend such emotion , suspense and action in such a way as "The Crossing Guard". And I admit I am quite a movie snob when it comes to quality movies. Just a great movie all around but you do need to be in the mood for a real actor's movie and not looking for a crash bang thing. I would highly recommend for anyone over 16.

I wonder how many viewers of The Crossing Guard (TCG) said such things because they viewed the same DVD edition I watched. I read the back of the DVD box afterwards, and I had to laugh. It seems to have been produced by people who have no idea what the movie's about. The box's lurid, breathless text markets this as an "action thriller", and makes it sound like a "Death Wish" or "High Noon" revenge showdown! A featured photo shows Freddy swingin' the chair. Although TCG revolves around revenge, and a gun features prominently, you almost won't know it. TCG is what you'd call a "literate drama." The revenge Freddy plans to exact is the story's driving force, but the bulk of the plot is character study and psychological drama, its two feet very much on the ground. Unlike some literate dramas -- ponderous, pretentious attempts at art, with static filming to match -- TCG has the goods. It's a sensitive, curious examination of a difficult main character and real-life subject matter. Since TCG gets quite disturbing at times, not least of all because of its broken, volatile, oft-unlikable protagonist, watching can be a challenge, but nonetheless it's refreshing to watch a complicated drama that doesn't push saccharine messages or pretend to have easy answers. It simply lets its characters loose to find their own way through a rather open-ended plot, and never loses sight of their humanity even while it acknowledges their awful acts. Stick with TCG and it will prove to be a rewarding film with both a mind and heart. The literary genre's artsiness and realismo -- "true-to-life" folks who are quirky but not really funny, half-heard scraps of conversation -- create a few annoying bits in TCG, but not enough to damage the proceedings. Bobby's long speech at the survivor's support group reflects the reality of inarticulate people who can't speak from a polished script, but it doesn't do much for the film. You'll just have to chuckle through TCG's candle-strewn "artists' party," of which only 10% of the dialogue makes a lick of sense. I admit that the John-Jojo relationship and pectoral-clutching push credibility. A better literate aspect in TCG is its humor, a pleasant surprise, especially coming from a writer/director better known for being humorless. When Freddy, falling apart from his rage, suddenly accepts the crowd's plea to join Mia the stripper on stage for a pole dance, it's remarkable, tense black comedy. Even better is when Freddy goes home with Mia, who surprises him by performing (and supposedly composing) a song for Freddy on her synthesizer decked out with blinking lights. Freddy just sits and watches in a stupor; whether it's from his booze or the music show is uncertain. In a Hitchcockian touch, a violent chase by foot detours into a city bus, and the participants must deal with bus fares, mistakes about the stops, and bickering passengers.

    I really don't understand why this movie didn't go further. I'm really missing the point of view of the negative voters and commenters. They all seem so harsh and cold. This movie should be FLOODED with emotional viewers and reviewers! Penn proved his chops as both writer and director here. You don't get these actors doing such a great job without great writing and directing, no matter who they are. You have to get the movie as a vehicle for the last minute of the film. You have to give the movie enough time-rope and attention-rope to let it hang you at the end. This is a punchline movie and you have to be the kind of person who is willing to be punched. You have to not get captured in Freddy's negativity. It's part of the setup. His lifestyle, part of the setup. Booth's flatness of affect, part of the setup. Just sit back, register it, allow yourself to be set up by it. Give it the time the movie deserves And let yourself get sweetly punched and redeemed at the end. I once had a friend who said they Hated Pulp Fiction. Near the end of the pawnshop scene she was cheering "get him, kill him" After, she said she hated it. She got SO involved with the movie and the characterizations that the hated to be so manipulated. She loved the movie, but she didn't know it.

    The pacing of this movie matches the story-line. You can feel it building to a crescendo...the ending is poignant. While Jack Nicholson's character is devolving, on a self-destructive course towards insanity, David Morse's character, on the other hand, is trying to rebuild his life. Guilt is eating both men alive from the inside. Angelica Houston's performance as the ex-wife is spot-on. When she finally opens up to Nicholson at the little cafe at midnite, he is no longer in a receptive mood. He's past the point of no return. The subject matter is heavy. How 2 people...both father and drunk driver...deal with their hate and guilt after the death of the daughter...is not a feel-good movie. But I think it's a subject that many of us have thought about...probably hoping and praying it would never happen to us. Many good performances here. David Morse is amazing as the reformed drunk driver...searching for his lost soul. Priscilla Barnes (from Three's Company) shows up as a stripper, and Nicholson's sometime girlfriend. She is very believable and it's a shame Hollywood typecast her as they did. One can tell from her performance here that she is capable of so much more. All-in-all, a very solid film. Not great, but definitely worth watching.

    Cannot say enough about this film. Never even knew it existed until it popped up on Netflix and I could not believe a Jack Nicholson film existed that I had not watched at least once. Wife and I watched this at home without interruption and really enjoyed it since we both had recently lost parents, friends and our dog, Scooter. But I never thought a movie could blend such emotion , suspense and action in such a way as "The Crossing Guard". And I admit I am quite a movie snob when it comes to quality movies. Just a great movie all around but you do need to be in the mood for a real actor's movie and not looking for a crash bang thing. I would highly recommend for anyone over 16.

    I have to take exception to what seems the be the majority view that this is an excellent film. The whole thing is contrived and phony. Throughout, there are innumerable points in the action where people do things and behave in ways completely contrary to what real people would do. The dialogue, too, is contrived. And one could have asked some more subtlety. As it is, it is clear from the get go that the vengeful father is the "bad" guy and the repentant killer is the "good" guy. Things are rarely so black and white. There is one scene further on in the film where Nicholson's character, in a conversation with his ex-wife, portrays some genuine grief and pain, but his portrayal up to that point completely belies that. And the many observations by viewers about the excessive and gratuitous nudity are on the mark. The completely contrived and unbelievable ending brings to mind Oscar Wilde's quote that "one would have to have a heart of stone not to dissolve into tears ...of laughter." Sean Penn should stick to his day job of acting and stay away from writing and directing.

    Legendary Actor Sean Penn's Criminally Under-Rated 'The Crossing Guard' is an astonishing, powerful Human Story, that leaves a terrific impact. And Acting Epitome, Jack Nicholson, is Mesmerising, as always. 'The Crossing Guard' Synopsis: Freddie Gale is a seedy jeweler who has sworn to kill the drunk driver who killed his little girl. 'The Crossing Guard' is unsettling, disturbing & dark. And that is its biggest victory, it treats this difficult Human Story with proper treatment & detailed execution. Penn's Screenplay & Direction, both, are exemplary. He has handled the film with majestic treatment & magnetic understanding. He's at the top of his game in here! Performance-Wise: Nicholson is mesmerizing. His performance as a father who's daughter was killed, is heartbreaking. Watch his breakdown sequence when he calls up his ex-wife, its haunting. Nicholson is an unmatchable, impeccable, flawless performer who's way above of any award. Anjelica Huston plays Nicholson's ex-wife & she's stunning. David Morse as the culprit, is extremely subdued & restrained. A graceful performance. Robin Wright Penn is efficient. On the whole, 'The Crossing Guard' is an astonishing cinematic achievement. Don't Miss It!

    Jack Nicholson stars as a man who lost his daughter five years ago to a drunk driver. The driver (David Morse) is just now getting out of prison, and Nicholson has sworn that he will kill the man. That's pretty much the entire set-up. There really isn't much plot to the film - it's just a contemplative look at two lost souls as they struggle to get on with their lives. Many seem to find it boring. I thought it was quite powerful, though it doesn't work 100% of the time. Nicholson's performance is uneven - he has a lot of good to great scenes, but there are times when he overacts, as well. Morse is the stronger of the two main performers - he's absolutely outstanding. Anjelica Huston is also strong as Nicholson's ex-wife - she's dealt with her pain much more healthily than Nicholson has, and she tries to talk him out of it (notably, though, she never informs the police of his plans, though, frankly, from what I know of her character I don't find it believable that she wouldn't). Huston was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globes. Robin Wright (before she hyphenated her last name) also co-stars as Morse's love interest. She doesn't have much to do, but she does do a sexy dance to Salt 'n Pepa's "Whatta Man". Penn's direction is quite great, as is the editing. It is a little slow, and there are a few bits that don't work (most involve Nicholson overacting), but I really liked it.

    Unhappily divorced jeweler Jack Nicholson (as Freddy Gale) learns the drunk driver held responsible for the death of his daughter has been released from prison. Swearing and shouting, Mr. Nicholson visits his happily re-married wife Anjelica Huston (as Mary) and announces he intends to kill newly free, but guilt-ridden David Morse (as John Booth). Nicholson finds Mr. Morse living in a trailer on his parents' property and aims his gun - but the weapon malfunctions. Nicholson's verbal blue-streak wakes Morse from his sleep. Morse asks for two, but Nicholson gives him three days to live. By then, that gun should be fixed... Morse admits, "It only hurts the first time," when describing his sexual activity in prison, then he hooks up with beautiful Robin Wright (as Jojo). She will hook up with writer/director Sean Penn, behind-the-scenes... Nicholson's Freddy continues to get drunk and pick-up arousing strippers. There is an eye-opening look at topless Pricilla Barnes (as Verna), who holds up well against the younger beauties. After the three days, Nicholson goes to kill Morse again. There is irony in the fact that Nicholson is most likely a drunk driver who wasn't as unlucky as the one who struck down his daughter. This is obvious from the beginning, but it may be intended as a big reveal. There are big, competent names attached to "The Crossing Guard" who are big and competent throughout; yet, you may never completely forget who they are and what you're watching. ****** The Crossing Guard (9/10/95) Sean Penn ~ Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Robin Wright, Anjelica Huston

    The daughter of Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson) was killed in an accident by John Booth (David Morse). The death of his child took a tool on Freddy, as his marriage broke up and he became an alcoholic, looking for a purpose in his life. Freddy plans to kill Booth as soon as he's released from prison, as he thinks, that the jail sentence is not enough punishment for the death of his daughter. He tells Booth, that he has three days to live. The movie is a mixture of thrill and sadness for the two man who, are connected by the unbelievable tragedy, although for different reasons. An expressive role of a big star Jack Nicholson with an expected final. Pleasant story by writer and director, Sean Penn.

    The opening to Sean Penn's directorial debut tees up its overall thesis of grief, or the studying of various ways of grieving, with a glimpse into that of a group counselling session driven at this point by a woman speaking of the death of her younger brother. She admits that she feels as if she will never again want to feel affectionate towards a human-being as much as she did her brother, for the fear born out of further loss, in what is a revealing and frank monologue of sorts on the issue. It is an instance in which somebody exposes some deeply rooted emotions out of the death of a loved one, Penn's film, The Crossing Guard, branching out into a fascinating and far broader play on the subject allowing actions and highly strung mindsets to drive a look at anguish, a film covering an array of people of grossly differing ilks suffering in some form due to a fatality; the likes of which are an affecting mediation that doubles up as a somewhat gripping tale of revenge that is never exploitative nor dunderheaded, and indeed remains constantly engrossing to its affecting finale. Penn's film is an engrossing low-key drama observing some rather high-key feelings of consciousness, a film with a creative and personal stamp all over it; principally, a film which looks at those on opposite sides of the death of a young girl at the hands of a drunk-driving incident and revolves a subversive nucleus around a number of sub-plots contributing to an overall thesis. One of these individuals is Jack Nicholson's Freddy Gale; a man, whose daughter is Emily and who was killed in that driving incident five years ago, whom is initially revealed as someone combating whatever grief he experiences by frequenting strip clubs so as to meet with his equally sleazy colleagues and which usually leads to the spending of a night with one of the performers. Freddy is the guy we're inclined towards siding with out of victimisation, but he is, in actual fact, a sleazy and unlikeable individual; with the perpetrator of the death coming across as a little bit more than the faceless, drink driving murderer we're, again, naturally inclined towards labelling as such. It's not as if we feel Freddy doesn't care, indeed he has the anniversary of his daughter's death vehemently stencilled in on his calender; while his clinicalness is exemplified in his dealing with a minute employee issue early on at his jewellers in an effective and shrewed manner. Freddy's lifestyle acts as something to sooth the pain, since his ex-wife, in Anjelica Huston's Mary, is seen during that opening therapy session born out of Emily's death; Penn cutting back and forth from such sequences at such places juxtaposing the content and alluding to a harsh duality in dealing with grief. The turntable which will unsettle the balance in each of these people's lives arrives in the form of David Morse's John Booth, the man who was responsible for Emily's death and is now out of prison after his stretch for it. You always feel that a genre piece would demand a man of such a nature be collected by a former criminal cohort or something in the region of; here, Booth is picked up by his parents, and he appears humble enough - speaking of the problems he experienced whilst incarcerated and appearing to have a good rapport with his folks. Indeed, his parents seem like gentle folk and still connect with each other at the age they're at, a far cry from Freddy and Mary on the other strand who're a lot younger but much further apart. Freddy, blinded by some vengeful rage, as well as the seemingly still prominent escalating need to prove his masculinity following the decimation of his marriage, and after so much time spent with women and in those specific locales with other men, tracks Booth with the intent to kill him. The men reach a compromise that sees Booth suggest he come back to his trailer-home in three days time to challenge him if he still wants blood to be spilt. Interestingly, this causes Freddy to go home and make an even larger stencil mark on his calender than that of the anniversary's date; an alluding to the hierarchical element to which date, as well as the actions predestined to be either acknowledged or carried out on such dates, acts as more important to him. Penn's film is one of a revenge ilk in which a lead reckons to grab the nearest firearm and hulk out to get some revenge so as to compensate for a lost or taken loved one; its substance in identifying that as a premise commonly used to drive such films as Commando or Rambo III, and allowing that respective denouement to occur in the first third, crucial to permitting the involved parties to play out what is from there on in an engrossing mediation on revenge; grief and guilt which ought not slip beneath one's radar.

Swearing and shouting, Mr. Nicholson visits his happily re-married wife Anjelica Huston (as Mary) and announces he intends to kill newly free, but guilt-ridden David Morse (as John Booth). Nicholson finds Mr. Morse living in a trailer on his parents' property and aims his gun - but the weapon malfunctions. Nicholson's verbal blue-streak wakes Morse from his sleep. Morse asks for two, but Nicholson gives him three days to live. By then, that gun should be fixed... Morse admits, "It only hurts the first time," when describing his sexual activity in prison, then he hooks up with beautiful Robin Wright (as Jojo). She will hook up with writer/director Sean Penn, behind-the-scenes... Nicholson's Freddy continues to get drunk and pick-up arousing strippers. There is an eye-opening look at topless Pricilla Barnes (as Verna), who holds up well against the younger beauties. After the three days, Nicholson goes to kill Morse again. There is irony in the fact that Nicholson is most likely a drunk driver who wasn't as unlucky as the one who struck down his daughter. This is obvious from the beginning, but it may be intended as a big reveal. There are big, competent names attached to "The Crossing Guard" who are big and competent throughout; yet, you may never completely forget who they are and what you're watching. ****** The Crossing Guard (9/10/95) Sean Penn ~ Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Robin Wright, Anjelica Huston

    The daughter of Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson) was killed in an accident by John Booth (David Morse). The death of his child took a tool on Freddy, as his marriage broke up and he became an alcoholic, looking for a purpose in his life. Freddy plans to kill Booth as soon as he's released from prison, as he thinks, that the jail sentence is not enough punishment for the death of his daughter. He tells Booth, that he has three days to live. The movie is a mixture of thrill and sadness for the two man who, are connected by the unbelievable tragedy, although for different reasons. An expressive role of a big star Jack Nicholson with an expected final. Pleasant story by writer and director, Sean Penn.

    Fabulously made character drama looking at behaviour and attitudes toward death on both sides of a proverbial coin born out of the death of an infant.

    The opening to Sean Penn's directorial debut tees up its overall thesis of grief, or the studying of various ways of grieving, with a glimpse into that of a group counselling session driven at this point by a woman speaking of the death of her younger brother. She admits that she feels as if she will never again want to feel affectionate towards a human-being as much as she did her brother, for the fear born out of further loss, in what is a revealing and frank monologue of sorts on the issue. It is an instance in which somebody exposes some deeply rooted emotions out of the death of a loved one, Penn's film, The Crossing Guard, branching out into a fascinating and far broader play on the subject allowing actions and highly strung mindsets to drive a look at anguish, a film covering an array of people of grossly differing ilks suffering in some form due to a fatality; the likes of which are an affecting mediation that doubles up as a somewhat gripping tale of revenge that is never exploitative nor dunderheaded, and indeed remains constantly engrossing to its affecting finale. Penn's film is an engrossing low-key drama observing some rather high-key feelings of consciousness, a film with a creative and personal stamp all over it; principally, a film which looks at those on opposite sides of the death of a young girl at the hands of a drunk-driving incident and revolves a subversive nucleus around a number of sub-plots contributing to an overall thesis. One of these individuals is Jack Nicholson's Freddy Gale; a man, whose daughter is Emily and who was killed in that driving incident five years ago, whom is initially revealed as someone combating whatever grief he experiences by frequenting strip clubs so as to meet with his equally sleazy colleagues and which usually leads to the spending of a night with one of the performers. Freddy is the guy we're inclined towards siding with out of victimisation, but he is, in actual fact, a sleazy and unlikeable individual; with the perpetrator of the death coming across as a little bit more than the faceless, drink driving murderer we're, again, naturally inclined towards labelling as such. It's not as if we feel Freddy doesn't care, indeed he has the anniversary of his daughter's death vehemently stencilled in on his calender; while his clinicalness is exemplified in his dealing with a minute employee issue early on at his jewellers in an effective and shrewed manner. Freddy's lifestyle acts as something to sooth the pain, since his ex-wife, in Anjelica Huston's Mary, is seen during that opening therapy session born out of Emily's death; Penn cutting back and forth from such sequences at such places juxtaposing the content and alluding to a harsh duality in dealing with grief. The turntable which will unsettle the balance in each of these people's lives arrives in the form of David Morse's John Booth, the man who was responsible for Emily's death and is now out of prison after his stretch for it. You always feel that a genre piece would demand a man of such a nature be collected by a former criminal cohort or something in the region of; here, Booth is picked up by his parents, and he appears humble enough - speaking of the problems he experienced whilst incarcerated and appearing to have a good rapport with his folks. Indeed, his parents seem like gentle folk and still connect with each other at the age they're at, a far cry from Freddy and Mary on the other strand who're a lot younger but much further apart. Freddy, blinded by some vengeful rage, as well as the seemingly still prominent escalating need to prove his masculinity following the decimation of his marriage, and after so much time spent with women and in those specific locales with other men, tracks Booth with the intent to kill him. The men reach a compromise that sees Booth suggest he come back to his trailer-home in three days time to challenge him if he still wants blood to be spilt. Interestingly, this causes Freddy to go home and make an even larger stencil mark on his calender than that of the anniversary's date; an alluding to the hierarchical element to which date, as well as the actions predestined to be either acknowledged or carried out on such dates, acts as more important to him. Penn's film is one of a revenge ilk in which a lead reckons to grab the nearest firearm and hulk out to get some revenge so as to compensate for a lost or taken loved one; its substance in identifying that as a premise commonly used to drive such films as Commando or Rambo III, and allowing that respective denouement to occur in the first third, crucial to permitting the involved parties to play out what is from there on in an engrossing mediation on revenge; grief and guilt which ought not slip beneath one's radar.

    "Too slow!" "So boring!" "Why the heck is it called 'The Crossing Guard?'" I wonder how many viewers of The Crossing Guard (TCG) said such things because they viewed the same DVD edition I watched. I read the back of the DVD box afterwards, and I had to laugh. It seems to have been produced by people who have no idea what the movie's about. The box's lurid, breathless text markets this as an "action thriller", and makes it sound like a "Death Wish" or "High Noon" revenge showdown! A featured photo shows Freddy swingin' the chair. Although TCG revolves around revenge, and a gun features prominently, you almost won't know it. TCG is what you'd call a "literate drama." The revenge Freddy plans to exact is the story's driving force, but the bulk of the plot is character study and psychological drama, its two feet very much on the ground. Unlike some literate dramas -- ponderous, pretentious attempts at art, with static filming to match -- TCG has the goods. It's a sensitive, curious examination of a difficult main character and real-life subject matter. Since TCG gets quite disturbing at times, not least of all because of its broken, volatile, oft-unlikable protagonist, watching can be a challenge, but nonetheless it's refreshing to watch a complicated drama that doesn't push saccharine messages or pretend to have easy answers. It simply lets its characters loose to find their own way through a rather open-ended plot, and never loses sight of their humanity even while it acknowledges their awful acts. Stick with TCG and it will prove to be a rewarding film with both a mind and heart. The literary genre's artsiness and realismo -- "true-to-life" folks who are quirky but not really funny, half-heard scraps of conversation -- create a few annoying bits in TCG, but not enough to damage the proceedings. Bobby's long speech at the survivor's support group reflects the reality of inarticulate people who can't speak from a polished script, but it doesn't do much for the film. You'll just have to chuckle through TCG's candle-strewn "artists' party," of which only 10% of the dialogue makes a lick of sense. I admit that the John-Jojo relationship and pectoral-clutching push credibility. A better literate aspect in TCG is its humor, a pleasant surprise, especially coming from a writer/director better known for being humorless. When Freddy, falling apart from his rage, suddenly accepts the crowd's plea to join Mia the stripper on stage for a pole dance, it's remarkable, tense black comedy. Even better is when Freddy goes home with Mia, who surprises him by performing (and supposedly composing) a song for Freddy on her synthesizer decked out with blinking lights. Freddy just sits and watches in a stupor; whether it's from his booze or the music show is uncertain. In a Hitchcockian touch, a violent chase by foot detours into a city bus, and the participants must deal with bus fares, mistakes about the stops, and bickering passengers.

    I really don't understand why this movie didn't go further. I'm really missing the point of view of the negative voters and commenters. They all seem so harsh and cold. This movie should be FLOODED with emotional viewers and reviewers! Penn proved his chops as both writer and director here. You don't get these actors doing such a great job without great writing and directing, no matter who they are. You have to get the movie as a vehicle for the last minute of the film. You have to give the movie enough time-rope and attention-rope to let it hang you at the end. This is a punchline movie and you have to be the kind of person who is willing to be punched. You have to not get captured in Freddy's negativity. It's part of the setup. His lifestyle, part of the setup. Booth's flatness of affect, part of the setup. Just sit back, register it, allow yourself to be set up by it. Give it the time the movie deserves And let yourself get sweetly punched and redeemed at the end. I once had a friend who said they Hated Pulp Fiction. Near the end of the pawnshop scene she was cheering "get him, kill him" After, she said she hated it. She got SO involved with the movie and the characterizations that the hated to be so manipulated. She loved the movie, but she didn't know it.
