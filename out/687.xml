 <storyline>
  Retired Lieutenant Commander Quinton McHale spends his days puttering around the Caribbean in the old PT-73 selling homebrew, ice cream, and swimsuit calendars. He's brought out of retirement when his old nemesis turned the second best terrorist in the world, Major Vladikov, takes over the island of San Moreno and starts building a nuclear launch silo on it. With help from his old crew and hindrances from Captain Wallace B. Binghampton, who sank a cruise liner a while back, McHale tries to put Vladikov out of business.

    Naval commander McHale has left the service and set-up trade on a Caribbean island, which supplies his former mates at a military base nearby with all their needs. The base is now commanded by Capt. Binghampton and island governor has a deal with a terrorist to use the island as base. McHale gets back into his crew when his arch-enemy Major Vladikov sets up an operation to destroy the island..... 1997 was a random year for comedy, you had watchable guff like Rocketman and Most Wanted, but then you had awful, brain dead movies like Gone Fishin', and this film. I don't think that it matters that I have never seen the series, but I get the jist. I'm guessing it was a lot like St. Bilko, but set at sea. Arnold is an okay screen presence, and is a wonderful supporting character, as seen in True Lies, and even Exit Wounds. But the man cannot carry a movie, and Carpool and this prove it, and no matter how many zany supporting characters there are, it doesn't help him. The story is awful, Messing looks desperate, and Curry hams it up almost illegally. There's a big explosion at the end and Dean Stockwell looks bored. Like I was after this dirge.

    Is it as good as the original series? No it isn't. Is it is the worst film ever? No, there are much worse- Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Titanic:The Animated Movie are all much worse than this. Is it a bad film? I personally don't think so. Yes the plot is predictable and falls into stupidity one too many times. Yes there are some hits and misses in the jokes and script, I actually found a lot of it funny but some of them(ie. Vladikov's 2nd best terrorist in the world boast) got old quite fast. And yes French Stewart is given very little to do. Despite this, I found myself enjoying it. I don't know why, I just did. The film looks nice enough, some of the scenery is colourful and the photography is decent enough. I liked the soundtrack too, especially Working on My Tan which was a nice addition. While corny, the script did get some laughs from me, and Bruce Campbell while underused is fun to watch. The direction is okay, the film moves quickly and is fairly short while nicely rounded off. The cast are fine on the whole. Ernest Borgnine is a joy as always as is Dean Stockwell whose comic talent here almost equals his TV counterpart Joe Flynn, as is Tim Curry(anybody who knows me knows I am a fan of Tim's), and Tom Arnold and Debra Messing are appealing too. Overall, hardly something to rave about but I personally don't think it deserves the panning it gets. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    From the moment I realized who the lead of this was, I knew I was doomed. I suffered the torment of this purely to be able to warn others. To confirm all your fears. Yes; this is utterly terrible. You can find ones flicks more insulting to your intelligence, but that does not excuse this. It is instantly and consistently irritating, it is obnoxious, and it is completely useless, except maybe as an instrument of torture. Not unlike Arnold himself. If you can't figure out how this will end about five minutes into it, you haven't watched enough movies... or I've seen far too many, I'm not certain which. This is just intolerable and unfunny throughout. From the commander who is always yapping like a chihuahua to the over the top jokes and gags with zero comedic value. At least the cartoon sound effects(!) are only heard a couple of times. Why would you cast French Stewart and give him nothing to do? Same goes for Campbell, the coolest thing about this(I would have thought he was a sure recipe for success no matter how poor the script, however, when he has nothing to work with... I mean, read the Trivia. He does get an awesome moment or two, thank god. Borgnine's too talented for this crap. Curry is a little enjoyable, and I can imagine he got a kick out of this. The music tends to be awful, and what little of it isn't are excellent Blues tunes that it should be against the law to use in a film so bad. At least the director has done better since this. I recommend this solely to those who refuse to believe that it is as worthless as it is. 1/10

    I am a fan of McHale's Navy, and since i enjoy watching the original series, I thought I'd see the movie, until I saw the cast. Tom Arnold as McHale, wow that started to kill my interest, then I saw Tim Curry, that killed it even more. David Allen Grier, who I like don't get me wrong, but as Ensign Parker, who is white, that kills the originality of the film because in order for it to be McHale's Navy, everyone who takes the role has to fit the part from the original series, so that means race, and gender, etc. Then a female as Captain Binghampton's aid, who is supposed to be a male, named Elroy Carpenter. French Stewart as Happy, and Happy is fat and bald, and I don't think French is, there isn't Fuji, there isn't Tinker, so they should have made a different name for the film because this isn't what the title says it is; it's not McHale's Navy, its someone else's Navy.

    The acting isn't the best and the story line is pretty stupid but it's a fun movie. Don't over analyze it because it's supposed to be a funny and retarded movie. Why else would Tom Arnold be in it? lol If you are a serious or uptight person who only appreciates high budget awarded winning films than don't bother watching it. On the other hand, if you are like me and enjoy watching all types of movies from low budget yet entertaining disasters to box office hits than you would probably enjoy this movie. I love Tim Curry as Vladikov. He is a great actor and always does extremely funny roles. I love this movie.It was extremely cheesy but it is so entertaining. When ever I want a good laugh this is one of the films I watch.

    OK for starters, this movie deserves far better than the 3.8 it currently holds, hence my 8/10. In truth, this film is a great piece of entertainment, and I can think of few films that are as mindless as they are funny. This is not meant to be Oscar material, but succeeds in entertaining from beginning to end. Bruce Campbell of course makes this worth seeing by himself, but the rest of the cast hold their own. Tom Arnold usually is seen as a bad indicator of quality, but his cheesy dialog has its moments. Rent it, buy it, just watch it, and judge for yourself. It will not be a waste of time.

    Making a movie remake of a great TV series is a highly risky endeavor. Unless the movie remake is absolutely fantastic, critics will rip the movie to shreds and so will a good number of viewers! Initially, I was annoyed by some of the character choices, feeling that the addition of a female for Lt.Carpentrer and a black for Ens. Parker was an act of putting too high a priority on "political correctness", over "entertainment". But the two, given the chance, proved that their roles were perfectly suited and they portrayed their characters brilliantly. David Alan Grier is a comic genius who had me in stitches! Dean Stockwell portrayed Capt. Binghampton with the same comic brilliance as the Late Great Joe Flynn. Tim Curry's Maj.Vladikov really gets on one's nerves with his constant complaining of being only the second biggest terrorist in the world and it is easy to despise him. But then again, Maj. Vladikov just happens to be the bad guy! So we're supposed to despise him. To really get the most out of this movie, one must forget the original series which took place during World War Two and simply focus on the this movie, which takes place in the present. The movie is funny. It has a action scenes and some edge-of-your-seat action. And if the movie was anywhere as bad as some critics made it out to be, would Ernest Borgnine, the original McHale had allowed himself to be involved with this film? I think not! Enjoy!

    Quint McHale (Tom Arnold) has made a fine life of smuggling contraband through the United States Navy in San Moreno. But his old nemesis, Major Vladikov, has set up base on a nearby island and is looking to become the world's best terrorist. While this movie is quite stupid, it's also really fun and I did find some parts amusing. It's a clean sort of fun, which you don't see much of any more, and I appreciated that. Strictly PG. And I enjoyed watching men follow Tom Arnold around (which, according to Bruce Campbell, is mostly all him and French Stewart were directed to do -- and if you watch for this, you'll see it right away). We also have Dean Stockwell, Debra Messing (before she was big), Tim Curry and Ernest Borgnine (the original McHale from the TV series). I am suspicious that whoever wrote this also wrote the "Maverick" movie, because there are some eerie similarities (some of which I can't get into without spoiling it). I don't know if that's a good thing or a very bad thing. I should also note this movie felt, to me, degrading to women. On one hand they're congratulating Penelope Carpenter (Messing) on her accomplishments as a woman, but then the next moment they are treating her different than everyone else. She is seen as supportive and inferior, and really her only purpose in the plot is to be a romantic interest for McHale -- the ultimate in secondary characters. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but they made it so obvious. All in all, I really did enjoy this movie. Why it received such a poor response from viewers, I don't know. The cast is eclectic and fun, the jokes silly but endearing. And as long as you like Tom Arnold (I don't mind him) you should be able to enjoy this film. Everyone seems to confuse it with "Down Periscope", which is too bad -- this is a good one in its own right.

    I watched this on a commercial station and between each advert break they flashed up the title card as 'McHale's War' instead of McHale's Navy, and that seemed to sum up the complete lack of interest this film generates in almost everybody. The TV station couldn't even get the title right. This is a bad film  a comedy that is consistently and forcefully unfunny. I didn't laugh once throughout the entire hellish running time, and only managed the barest ghost of a smile on a couple of occasions. Let's face it  any film in which Tom Arnold is the star is in trouble from the off. For all I know he may well be a wonderful person but he isn't a star and he isn't a comedian. The only time he's funny is during the 'action' sequences and when he tries to act serious: his nostrils flare a little and his eyes widen a touch and that's it  it's a kind of one-size-fits-all expression for every emotion he is called upon to express. He's supposed to be one of those charismatic types in this film, the type of guy everyone warms to the moment he opens his mouth. That's right  Tom Arnold. Did some casting executive read this part and really think to himself 'why, that's a part just tailor-made for that Tom Arnold chap? Hmmm. Dean Stockwell is also in this, he's quite a good actor but he's awful here  in fact he hasn't been much good in anything since Married to the Mob. Tim Curry is just a cartoon character in a flesh suit these days and sleepwalks through his role. The running joke about his being the second greatest terrorist in the world is done to death in the first twenty minutes of the film and then thankfully forgotten. Only the ever-solid Bill Campbell is worth a look, but his part is woefully small. The TV show was around before my time, so I've no point of reference with regard to how accurately this film captures the atmosphere of the show, but somehow I can't believe it was as lame as this. If it was the film would never have been greenlighted. Do yourself a favour and do what everyone involved in this mess should have done: give it a wide, wide berth.

Normally this wouldn't bother me, but they made it so obvious. All in all, I really did enjoy this movie. Why it received such a poor response from viewers, I don't know. The cast is eclectic and fun, the jokes silly but endearing. And as long as you like Tom Arnold (I don't mind him) you should be able to enjoy this film. Everyone seems to confuse it with "Down Periscope", which is too bad -- this is a good one in its own right.

    I watched this on a commercial station and between each advert break they flashed up the title card as 'McHale's War' instead of McHale's Navy, and that seemed to sum up the complete lack of interest this film generates in almost everybody. The TV station couldn't even get the title right. This is a bad film  a comedy that is consistently and forcefully unfunny. I didn't laugh once throughout the entire hellish running time, and only managed the barest ghost of a smile on a couple of occasions. Let's face it  any film in which Tom Arnold is the star is in trouble from the off. For all I know he may well be a wonderful person but he isn't a star and he isn't a comedian. The only time he's funny is during the 'action' sequences and when he tries to act serious: his nostrils flare a little and his eyes widen a touch and that's it  it's a kind of one-size-fits-all expression for every emotion he is called upon to express. He's supposed to be one of those charismatic types in this film, the type of guy everyone warms to the moment he opens his mouth. That's right  Tom Arnold. Did some casting executive read this part and really think to himself 'why, that's a part just tailor-made for that Tom Arnold chap? Hmmm. Dean Stockwell is also in this, he's quite a good actor but he's awful here  in fact he hasn't been much good in anything since Married to the Mob. Tim Curry is just a cartoon character in a flesh suit these days and sleepwalks through his role. The running joke about his being the second greatest terrorist in the world is done to death in the first twenty minutes of the film and then thankfully forgotten. Only the ever-solid Bill Campbell is worth a look, but his part is woefully small. The TV show was around before my time, so I've no point of reference with regard to how accurately this film captures the atmosphere of the show, but somehow I can't believe it was as lame as this. If it was the film would never have been greenlighted. Do yourself a favour and do what everyone involved in this mess should have done: give it a wide, wide berth.

    Naval commander McHale has left the service and set-up trade on a Caribbean island, which supplies his former mates at a military base nearby with all their needs. The base is now commanded by Capt. Binghampton and island governor has a deal with a terrorist to use the island as base. McHale gets back into his crew when his arch-enemy Major Vladikov sets up an operation to destroy the island..... 1997 was a random year for comedy, you had watchable guff like Rocketman and Most Wanted, but then you had awful, brain dead movies like Gone Fishin', and this film. I don't think that it matters that I have never seen the series, but I get the jist. I'm guessing it was a lot like St. Bilko, but set at sea. Arnold is an okay screen presence, and is a wonderful supporting character, as seen in True Lies, and even Exit Wounds. But the man cannot carry a movie, and Carpool and this prove it, and no matter how many zany supporting characters there are, it doesn't help him. The story is awful, Messing looks desperate, and Curry hams it up almost illegally. There's a big explosion at the end and Dean Stockwell looks bored. Like I was after this dirge.

    Is it as good as the original series? No it isn't. Is it is the worst film ever? No, there are much worse- Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Titanic:The Animated Movie are all much worse than this. Is it a bad film? I personally don't think so. Yes the plot is predictable and falls into stupidity one too many times. Yes there are some hits and misses in the jokes and script, I actually found a lot of it funny but some of them(ie. Vladikov's 2nd best terrorist in the world boast) got old quite fast. And yes French Stewart is given very little to do. Despite this, I found myself enjoying it. I don't know why, I just did. The film looks nice enough, some of the scenery is colourful and the photography is decent enough. I liked the soundtrack too, especially Working on My Tan which was a nice addition. While corny, the script did get some laughs from me, and Bruce Campbell while underused is fun to watch. The direction is okay, the film moves quickly and is fairly short while nicely rounded off. The cast are fine on the whole. Ernest Borgnine is a joy as always as is Dean Stockwell whose comic talent here almost equals his TV counterpart Joe Flynn, as is Tim Curry(anybody who knows me knows I am a fan of Tim's), and Tom Arnold and Debra Messing are appealing too. Overall, hardly something to rave about but I personally don't think it deserves the panning it gets. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    From the moment I realized who the lead of this was, I knew I was doomed. I suffered the torment of this purely to be able to warn others. To confirm all your fears. Yes; this is utterly terrible. You can find ones flicks more insulting to your intelligence, but that does not excuse this. It is instantly and consistently irritating, it is obnoxious, and it is completely useless, except maybe as an instrument of torture. Not unlike Arnold himself. If you can't figure out how this will end about five minutes into it, you haven't watched enough movies... or I've seen far too many, I'm not certain which. This is just intolerable and unfunny throughout. From the commander who is always yapping like a chihuahua to the over the top jokes and gags with zero comedic value. At least the cartoon sound effects(!) are only heard a couple of times. Why would you cast French Stewart and give him nothing to do? Same goes for Campbell, the coolest thing about this(I would have thought he was a sure recipe for success no matter how poor the script, however, when he has nothing to work with... I mean, read the Trivia. He does get an awesome moment or two, thank god. Borgnine's too talented for this crap. Curry is a little enjoyable, and I can imagine he got a kick out of this. The music tends to be awful, and what little of it isn't are excellent Blues tunes that it should be against the law to use in a film so bad. At least the director has done better since this. I recommend this solely to those who refuse to believe that it is as worthless as it is. 1/10

    I am a fan of McHale's Navy, and since i enjoy watching the original series, I thought I'd see the movie, until I saw the cast. Tom Arnold as McHale, wow that started to kill my interest, then I saw Tim Curry, that killed it even more. David Allen Grier, who I like don't get me wrong, but as Ensign Parker, who is white, that kills the originality of the film because in order for it to be McHale's Navy, everyone who takes the role has to fit the part from the original series, so that means race, and gender, etc. Then a female as Captain Binghampton's aid, who is supposed to be a male, named Elroy Carpenter. French Stewart as Happy, and Happy is fat and bald, and I don't think French is, there isn't Fuji, there isn't Tinker, so they should have made a different name for the film because this isn't what the title says it is; it's not McHale's Navy, its someone else's Navy.

    The acting isn't the best and the story line is pretty stupid but it's a fun movie. Don't over analyze it because it's supposed to be a funny and retarded movie. Why else would Tom Arnold be in it? lol If you are a serious or uptight person who only appreciates high budget awarded winning films than don't bother watching it. On the other hand, if you are like me and enjoy watching all types of movies from low budget yet entertaining disasters to box office hits than you would probably enjoy this movie. I love Tim Curry as Vladikov. He is a great actor and always does extremely funny roles. I love this movie.It was extremely cheesy but it is so entertaining. When ever I want a good laugh this is one of the films I watch.

    OK for starters, this movie deserves far better than the 3.8 it currently holds, hence my 8/10. In truth, this film is a great piece of entertainment, and I can think of few films that are as mindless as they are funny. This is not meant to be Oscar material, but succeeds in entertaining from beginning to end. Bruce Campbell of course makes this worth seeing by himself, but the rest of the cast hold their own. Tom Arnold usually is seen as a bad indicator of quality, but his cheesy dialog has its moments. Rent it, buy it, just watch it, and judge for yourself. It will not be a waste of time.

    Making a movie remake of a great TV series is a highly risky endeavor. Unless the movie remake is absolutely fantastic, critics will rip the movie to shreds and so will a good number of viewers! Initially, I was annoyed by some of the character choices, feeling that the addition of a female for Lt.Carpentrer and a black for Ens. Parker was an act of putting too high a priority on "political correctness", over "entertainment". But the two, given the chance, proved that their roles were perfectly suited and they portrayed their characters brilliantly. David Alan Grier is a comic genius who had me in stitches! Dean Stockwell portrayed Capt. Binghampton with the same comic brilliance as the Late Great Joe Flynn. Tim Curry's Maj.Vladikov really gets on one's nerves with his constant complaining of being only the second biggest terrorist in the world and it is easy to despise him. But then again, Maj. Vladikov just happens to be the bad guy! So we're supposed to despise him. To really get the most out of this movie, one must forget the original series which took place during World War Two and simply focus on the this movie, which takes place in the present. The movie is funny. It has a action scenes and some edge-of-your-seat action. And if the movie was anywhere as bad as some critics made it out to be, would Ernest Borgnine, the original McHale had allowed himself to be involved with this film? I think not! Enjoy!

    Quint McHale (Tom Arnold) has made a fine life of smuggling contraband through the United States Navy in San Moreno. But his old nemesis, Major Vladikov, has set up base on a nearby island and is looking to become the world's best terrorist. While this movie is quite stupid, it's also really fun and I did find some parts amusing. It's a clean sort of fun, which you don't see much of any more, and I appreciated that. Strictly PG. And I enjoyed watching men follow Tom Arnold around (which, according to Bruce Campbell, is mostly all him and French Stewart were directed to do -- and if you watch for this, you'll see it right away). We also have Dean Stockwell, Debra Messing (before she was big), Tim Curry and Ernest Borgnine (the original McHale from the TV series). I am suspicious that whoever wrote this also wrote the "Maverick" movie, because there are some eerie similarities (some of which I can't get into without spoiling it). I don't know if that's a good thing or a very bad thing. I should also note this movie felt, to me, degrading to women. On one hand they're congratulating Penelope Carpenter (Messing) on her accomplishments as a woman, but then the next moment they are treating her different than everyone else. She is seen as supportive and inferior, and really her only purpose in the plot is to be a romantic interest for McHale -- the ultimate in secondary characters. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but they made it so obvious. All in all, I really did enjoy this movie. Why it received such a poor response from viewers, I don't know.

We also have Dean Stockwell, Debra Messing (before she was big), Tim Curry and Ernest Borgnine (the original McHale from the TV series). I am suspicious that whoever wrote this also wrote the "Maverick" movie, because there are some eerie similarities (some of which I can't get into without spoiling it). I don't know if that's a good thing or a very bad thing. I should also note this movie felt, to me, degrading to women. On one hand they're congratulating Penelope Carpenter (Messing) on her accomplishments as a woman, but then the next moment they are treating her different than everyone else. She is seen as supportive and inferior, and really her only purpose in the plot is to be a romantic interest for McHale -- the ultimate in secondary characters. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but they made it so obvious. All in all, I really did enjoy this movie. Why it received such a poor response from viewers, I don't know. The cast is eclectic and fun, the jokes silly but endearing. And as long as you like Tom Arnold (I don't mind him) you should be able to enjoy this film. Everyone seems to confuse it with "Down Periscope", which is too bad -- this is a good one in its own right.

    I watched this on a commercial station and between each advert break they flashed up the title card as 'McHale's War' instead of McHale's Navy, and that seemed to sum up the complete lack of interest this film generates in almost everybody. The TV station couldn't even get the title right. This is a bad film  a comedy that is consistently and forcefully unfunny. I didn't laugh once throughout the entire hellish running time, and only managed the barest ghost of a smile on a couple of occasions. Let's face it  any film in which Tom Arnold is the star is in trouble from the off. For all I know he may well be a wonderful person but he isn't a star and he isn't a comedian. The only time he's funny is during the 'action' sequences and when he tries to act serious: his nostrils flare a little and his eyes widen a touch and that's it  it's a kind of one-size-fits-all expression for every emotion he is called upon to express. He's supposed to be one of those charismatic types in this film, the type of guy everyone warms to the moment he opens his mouth. That's right  Tom Arnold. Did some casting executive read this part and really think to himself 'why, that's a part just tailor-made for that Tom Arnold chap? Hmmm. Dean Stockwell is also in this, he's quite a good actor but he's awful here  in fact he hasn't been much good in anything since Married to the Mob. Tim Curry is just a cartoon character in a flesh suit these days and sleepwalks through his role. The running joke about his being the second greatest terrorist in the world is done to death in the first twenty minutes of the film and then thankfully forgotten. Only the ever-solid Bill Campbell is worth a look, but his part is woefully small. The TV show was around before my time, so I've no point of reference with regard to how accurately this film captures the atmosphere of the show, but somehow I can't believe it was as lame as this. If it was the film would never have been greenlighted. Do yourself a favour and do what everyone involved in this mess should have done: give it a wide, wide berth.
