    How wonderful remembering Michael J. Fox, young, vibrant, in good health and very much entertaining in this romantic 1993 comedy. When you see the first scene of the film, you think that Fox is a tyrant in the way that he can't stand to be in traffic. Nothing could be farther from the truth from that statement. He is the concierge at a Manhattan hotel who is totally sympathetic to the people working there. The story basically revolves around the fact that Fox likes the perfume girl behind the counter, only to find out that she is the mistress of a wealthy, nasty frequent visitor to the hotel. Shall we say that Fox and the guy continually do each other favors. The Bob Balaban role as an IRS agent quickly falls apart and Fyvush Finkel as an elderly employee make the film shine. The film does go down in the sense that there are too many intricate situations occurring. This is not the 1967 "Hotel" film.

    I can't understand why this film gets such a low rating on IMDb. It's got everything - love, romance, dream, struggle, deception, insecurity, fear and hope. Its happy ending comes from the heart, not from the formula. Part of the reason the movie works so well is the screenplay which has got it right at all the right points. Some people say it's not "funny" enough, well, as far as I am concerned, for the genre of romantic comedy, it's very humorous (my personal favorite line is "how did my secretary get here?" - priceless!!). Second, the sincere and very endearing performances of the cast. The WHOLE cast. As for the lead, "Concierge" happens to be my favorite MJF's film. He is so natural in this, it doesn't even feel like he is acting. Gabrielle Anwar gives a pretty solid performance as well, and the chemistry between Andy and Doug is overwhelming. Well, pretty much every character is well written and acted and stands out on his/her own - Mr. Drinkwater, Milton, Mr. Himmelman, Julian Russel, Mr. Wegman... I find the Doug-Wegman plot line particularly dear and I shed a couple of tears every time Mr. Wegman tells Doug he is going to invest the money and make Doug's dream come true. I also think this movie has one of the best turning points (or one hour crisis points) ever. Again, my heart starts beating faster every time when Doug tells Andy about the hotel of his dreams as he narrates the unfortunate story of his father. "I am not going to be a 59 year old bellhop", says Doug. "Concierge"... - corrects him Andy. The roles are reversed here, before Doug had insisted to be called "concierge" instead of "bellhop" and now Andy calls him that. We see how, for the first time, Andy realizes that Doug is not her lover's "puppet", but an individual, a person with a great hope and a great dream. Overall, it's a wonderful family film to watch on a rainy day, right between "The Apartment" and "Sideways". Well, you can enjoy it even it you haven't got a family. It still works.

    While this movie is certainly not one that stands out about all other Fox movies, it's entertaining nonetheless due to Michael J. Fox's innate charm and it's fun to see his attempts at juggling a demanding investor, eccentric clients and an eclectic group of co-workers all while trying to figure out if he should go for the girl... or the property he wants. The script is really quite weak but the way it's shot is brilliant and Sonnefeld's direction makes it flow quite effortlessly. It's an hour-and-a-half and change movie that only feels like it takes an hour to sit through. I agree with the others who said it's a good movie to watch on a rainy day, or just when you're in the mood for a feel-good (though granted not laugh-out-loud) comedy. The funniest scenes are with the elderly bellhop and the parrot. Incidentally, the parrot was almost as good as Michael J. Fox in this movie (that's not an insult to Fox, by the way; the bird is just that funny--- definitely something you have to see to believe). I recommend it, but will everyone like it? No, in fact, some won't be able to sit through it because it can get slightly boring in parts. If you have patience though and a true love for Fox's work, you'll find it quite charming. 6/10 stars.

    I have seen this film about 4 times and always enjoy it. Michael J. Fox is perfect as the hotel concierge that seems to know everyone and takes care of everyone but himself. The premise is not unrealistic and the support characters perfect NY caricatures. Lots of fun cameos and "big" little roles add up to an entertaining film that never gets boring. Great party scene at the Long Island mansion, wonderful interaction with bellman Fyvush Finkel and look for one of my favorite TV and movie small role players Erik Avari as a seedy jewelery/pawn shop owner. You'll win brownie points with the wife or girlfriend by renting this one and it's funny enough to keep the guys happy as well.

    Michael J. Fox offers one of his strongest performances in FOR LOVE OR MONEY, a predictable yet entertaining comedy that bears more than a passing resemblance to the 1960 classic THE APARTMENT. Fox plays Doug, the slick concierge at a fancy Manhatten hotel who becomes caught between an unscrupulous businessman (Anthony Higgins), who he's hoping will help to finance his dream of his own hotel and his mistress (Gabrielle Anwar), a department store clerk and aspiring singer who refuses to accept the fact that the man is married and will never leave his wife. Fox gives his best performance since BACK TO TO THE FUTURE as a fast talking yet utterly charming con artist with impeccable people skills which have become both a benefit and a detriment where his work is concerned. Anwar is an attractive leading lady and Higgins is appropriately smarmy as the villain of the piece. An intelligent screenplay and noteworthy supporting turns by Michael Tucker as a hotel guest and Fyvesh Finkle as a senile bell hop are icing on the cake for this smart little comedy that went virtually unnoticed at the time of its release but provides breezy entertainment.

    I was on tour with my friend in Budapest. The Concierge was on one of the only two English speaking channels in the hotel. We watched it 5 times in a row. We then went out to eat at a vegetarian restaurant that was also a college. We then played a concert, returned to the hotel and watched it 5 more times! I am not kidding. This movie is terrific and very comforting and nice. See it over and over again like Breaking Away, War Games, Alien or Contempt. MJF is very sincere in this film. I have never forgotten it. Not in the same way I have never forgotten Don't BE AFRAID OF THE DARK! Beware of that movie. This is the perfect MJK film it is like the first BTTF movie or the Frighteners in that it has a sincere cohesion. This is a small unsung film but will be celebrated in the future as a classic.

    I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time I'd be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization. This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. In short it does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments.

    When I knew that Michael J. Fox, made another romantic movie in 1993 (after doc Hollywood) I really got excited. So, all I wanted to do, was to found this movie. I saw trailer and I thought it was very interesting to watch. And NOW I DID IT. Anyway, I think that it's a very good movie, I always liked Michael J. Fox, but the truth is that I expected a little bit more of romance. I was missing something. I do not know if you are agree with me, but the real Michael J. Fox is found in TV series, I mean, Family Ties and Spin City are ten times better. But I can't deny the fact that I love when he is romantic. Bye.

    This is one of the few additions in the vast boring arena of calm romantic comedies that's worth a watch in a relaxing mind. I really like Michael J. Fox as an actor and I think he's done a good job here. It's a pity a versatile actor such as him has decided not to make any movies further. Gabrielle Anwar ("Body Snatchers") also looks and acts quite nicely. The story, however, has no surprise elements, it's told for like thousand times. But still, due to smart screenplay and decent acting by the two lead actors, the film never gets tiresome to watch. And the funny parts, if not hilarious, not irritating either and fit nicely with the film's quiet mood.

    Doug Ireland (Fox), the bellhop of a ritzy hotel, has a dream to develop his own hotel. His best hope for a sponsor to raise the three million he needs by the deadline is Christian Hanover, but things get complicated when Christian asks Doug to look after his girlfriend (Gabrielle Anwar), who Doug is in love with. We know this story as "The Concierge" in Australia. Its a great fun romantic comedy and family movie - great for a weekend home with the family, or its a sure bet for a video at home with your partner. The chemistry between Michael J Fox and gorgeous Gabrielle Anwar (the girl Pacino does that famous tango with in Scent of a Woman) is precious - and its great to see them both as leads in a movie. 8/10.

"I am not going to be a 59 year old bellhop", says Doug. "Concierge"... - corrects him Andy. The roles are reversed here, before Doug had insisted to be called "concierge" instead of "bellhop" and now Andy calls him that. We see how, for the first time, Andy realizes that Doug is not her lover's "puppet", but an individual, a person with a great hope and a great dream. Overall, it's a wonderful family film to watch on a rainy day, right between "The Apartment" and "Sideways". Well, you can enjoy it even it you haven't got a family. It still works.

    While this movie is certainly not one that stands out about all other Fox movies, it's entertaining nonetheless due to Michael J. Fox's innate charm and it's fun to see his attempts at juggling a demanding investor, eccentric clients and an eclectic group of co-workers all while trying to figure out if he should go for the girl... or the property he wants. The script is really quite weak but the way it's shot is brilliant and Sonnefeld's direction makes it flow quite effortlessly. It's an hour-and-a-half and change movie that only feels like it takes an hour to sit through. I agree with the others who said it's a good movie to watch on a rainy day, or just when you're in the mood for a feel-good (though granted not laugh-out-loud) comedy. The funniest scenes are with the elderly bellhop and the parrot. Incidentally, the parrot was almost as good as Michael J. Fox in this movie (that's not an insult to Fox, by the way; the bird is just that funny--- definitely something you have to see to believe). I recommend it, but will everyone like it? No, in fact, some won't be able to sit through it because it can get slightly boring in parts. If you have patience though and a true love for Fox's work, you'll find it quite charming. 6/10 stars.

    I have seen this film about 4 times and always enjoy it. Michael J. Fox is perfect as the hotel concierge that seems to know everyone and takes care of everyone but himself. The premise is not unrealistic and the support characters perfect NY caricatures. Lots of fun cameos and "big" little roles add up to an entertaining film that never gets boring. Great party scene at the Long Island mansion, wonderful interaction with bellman Fyvush Finkel and look for one of my favorite TV and movie small role players Erik Avari as a seedy jewelery/pawn shop owner. You'll win brownie points with the wife or girlfriend by renting this one and it's funny enough to keep the guys happy as well.

    Michael J. Fox offers one of his strongest performances in FOR LOVE OR MONEY, a predictable yet entertaining comedy that bears more than a passing resemblance to the 1960 classic THE APARTMENT. Fox plays Doug, the slick concierge at a fancy Manhatten hotel who becomes caught between an unscrupulous businessman (Anthony Higgins), who he's hoping will help to finance his dream of his own hotel and his mistress (Gabrielle Anwar), a department store clerk and aspiring singer who refuses to accept the fact that the man is married and will never leave his wife. Fox gives his best performance since BACK TO TO THE FUTURE as a fast talking yet utterly charming con artist with impeccable people skills which have become both a benefit and a detriment where his work is concerned. Anwar is an attractive leading lady and Higgins is appropriately smarmy as the villain of the piece. An intelligent screenplay and noteworthy supporting turns by Michael Tucker as a hotel guest and Fyvesh Finkle as a senile bell hop are icing on the cake for this smart little comedy that went virtually unnoticed at the time of its release but provides breezy entertainment.

    I was on tour with my friend in Budapest. The Concierge was on one of the only two English speaking channels in the hotel. We watched it 5 times in a row. We then went out to eat at a vegetarian restaurant that was also a college. We then played a concert, returned to the hotel and watched it 5 more times! I am not kidding. This movie is terrific and very comforting and nice. See it over and over again like Breaking Away, War Games, Alien or Contempt. MJF is very sincere in this film. I have never forgotten it. Not in the same way I have never forgotten Don't BE AFRAID OF THE DARK! Beware of that movie. This is the perfect MJK film it is like the first BTTF movie or the Frighteners in that it has a sincere cohesion. This is a small unsung film but will be celebrated in the future as a classic.

    I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time I'd be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization. This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. In short it does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments.

    When I knew that Michael J. Fox, made another romantic movie in 1993 (after doc Hollywood) I really got excited. So, all I wanted to do, was to found this movie. I saw trailer and I thought it was very interesting to watch. And NOW I DID IT. Anyway, I think that it's a very good movie, I always liked Michael J. Fox, but the truth is that I expected a little bit more of romance. I was missing something. I do not know if you are agree with me, but the real Michael J. Fox is found in TV series, I mean, Family Ties and Spin City are ten times better. But I can't deny the fact that I love when he is romantic. Bye.

    This is one of the few additions in the vast boring arena of calm romantic comedies that's worth a watch in a relaxing mind. I really like Michael J. Fox as an actor and I think he's done a good job here. It's a pity a versatile actor such as him has decided not to make any movies further. Gabrielle Anwar ("Body Snatchers") also looks and acts quite nicely. The story, however, has no surprise elements, it's told for like thousand times. But still, due to smart screenplay and decent acting by the two lead actors, the film never gets tiresome to watch. And the funny parts, if not hilarious, not irritating either and fit nicely with the film's quiet mood.

    Doug Ireland (Fox), the bellhop of a ritzy hotel, has a dream to develop his own hotel. His best hope for a sponsor to raise the three million he needs by the deadline is Christian Hanover, but things get complicated when Christian asks Doug to look after his girlfriend (Gabrielle Anwar), who Doug is in love with. We know this story as "The Concierge" in Australia. Its a great fun romantic comedy and family movie - great for a weekend home with the family, or its a sure bet for a video at home with your partner. The chemistry between Michael J Fox and gorgeous Gabrielle Anwar (the girl Pacino does that famous tango with in Scent of a Woman) is precious - and its great to see them both as leads in a movie. 8/10.
