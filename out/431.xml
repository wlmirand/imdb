 <sinopse>
  An immortal Scottish swordsman must confront the last of his immortal opponent, a murderously brutal barbarian who lusts for the fabled "Prize".
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Born in the Highlands of Scotland in 1518, Connor Macleod is immortal. When he is wounded in battle but does not die, he is banished from his village. He meets another like himself, Ramirez, who teaches him swordsmanship--the only way to kill another immortal is to take his head--and the ways of the immortals.

    Highlander to me represents everything that is wrong with movies - cheesy acting, poor fight choreography, a share of pointless characters and motives, a lot of plot holes and really odd directional choices - yet for some reason I watch it every couple of weeks. Without spoiling it, the movie deals with a group of people who are deemed "immortal" and thus cannot die unless they are killed by another immortal. The last immortal standing wins the mysterious "prize" and I'll say no more than that, but be prepared for a lot of sword fighting, the immortals weapon of choice, simply because they can only be killed by loosing their heads - literally! There is something very charming in this film, and I can only really explain it in its pacing. This film has possibly some of the best editing and pacing in any movie. It sets up every scene well, we know who is doing what and why, it takes time to explain via flashbacks (poorly acted and shot flashbacks true!) all its concepts and meanings. At no point in the film are we ever confused as to what an "immortal" is, and it explains well concepts like "the quickening", granted these are incredibly stupid and bizarre concepts that are largely laughable, but the movie clearly isn't taking itself that seriously. One appeal of the movie is in itself its poor approach to acting. A lot has been said about how awful the acting is in this movie, yet for some reason I find it somewhat appropriate to the whole theme of the film. In some ways it adds laughable charm. The villain of the movie is delightfully over the top making him one of the films most appealing aspects. High art this is not, a well thought-out and developed, albeit it crappy story can always provide me with entrainment. I always recommend this movie simply because, to me at least, its a perfect example of a movie that has a silly idea, but sticks to its guns and delivers it so well. At no point does the movie ever cut its losses and even attempt to return to something conventional - and for that I have to give it credit!

    Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is banished from his Scottish village in the 16th century after surviving a fatal injury (and thus believed to be in league with the devil). He meets Ramirez (Sean Connery), who reveals they are both Immortals; he becomes a mentor for Connor, even teaching him swordsmanship. In the present day, all Immortals are drawn together and have to fight until only one is left... This very creative and entertaining 80's fantasy/adventure was created by Gregory Widen, who would later also make another excellent fantasy 'The Prophecy'. An excellent and creative mind he is, a pity he doesn't make many films or screenplays. The director, Russell Mulcahy, is a former music video director; as such, the action scenes are frantic and the film is quite fast-paced. Surprisingly, this is not a negative point here. 'Highlander' feels, in many ways, as two separate films: there is the modern storyline, and the past 'flashbacks' where most of the story aspects are detailed. The quality varies a lot between them, too. The past is the best part. The scenes are livelier, being actually shot in the Scottish Highlands; there is a substantial amount of character development and, despite Lambert's limited acting ability, Connor truly starts growing on the viewer. Furthermore, Sean Connery lends much charm and wit as the Immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez (who is Egyptian but acts like a Spaniard). It is in this part that Widen's ingenuity is at its best; even the special effects, while very dated even at the time, end up being somewhat charming. 9/10 On the other hand, the modern parts take place in New York. They are often nighttime scenes, with a gloomy and dark mood that reminds more of a dystopian reality than the run-down parts of New York. The action sequences are good, but the special effects this time around end up being a negative point; furthermore, a weak supporting cast (which includes Roxanne Hart and Alan North), as well as the Immortal villain played by Clancy Brown (whose better moments are fighting Connery in the past scenes) hinders this portion of the story. 5/10 The final fight and conclusion are decent, though, and appropriately concludes the story (tying together major plot points, while leaving enough questions to light the viewer's imagination). In both 'stories', there is a fun and often witty dialogue. Also an excellent soundtrack by Queen which includes 'A Kind of Magic' and the 'Highlander's trademark 'Who Wants to Live Forever'. This is one film that, even if not remembered as a masterpiece, will always remain a classic. 'There can only be one!' Why couldn't the producers follow the Immortals' advice, and stray from making the awful sequels that only ended up staining the original's reputation?

    After many years I watched again Highlander. I didn't remember much of it, except that the last time I saw it I came away with a so-so kind of impression. Well, this time it was worse. The movie, or I, didn't age well. Probably both. Obviously, it's an action flick, so the plot is paper thin, something to do with immortals trying to chop each other's heads off for reasons the writers had the good grace to mostly leave in the dark, and at some point the central conflict gets a little more personal anyway. The plot isn't the problem, by the standards of the genre it's as good as any. And, of course, being made in the 80ies there is only so much one can expect in terms of technical perfection. The fight scenes are a bit tedious, and the special effects funny, but that, too, isn't really the problem. One problem is that the acting is uniformly bad. In fact, it's been a while since I saw a cast that failed at their jobs in almost perfect harmony. To be fair, the script doesn't provide a awful lot of opportunity for great acting, but all major actors even fail at the most basic emotions, much less the few instances where some complexity might have been nice. In part that is also the fault of script, direction, and photography; a good example is a very emotional moment between our hero and his wife, which is filled with stilted monologue, quick glances at Lambert's expressionless face, and then sweeping landscape shots to illustrate the enormity of the emotion that the actor didn't. The story itself is confused, and the characters are difficult to care for, and cartoonish. A few immortals pop into (and often quickly out of, in ways that make a mockery of the concept of "immortal") the storyline, but we never really learn much about them (with the exception of a little bit of background on Connery's character). The modern love story is contrived and ludicrous, and as much just a pretext for a little bit of mild nudity and humping as the rest is for the fight scenes. It's a carelessly strung together collection of stuff that is best not taken too seriously. Another small annoyance is the music --- good pieces by Queen, but as a soundtrack to a movie too intrusive. I guess it might still work for fans, but I doubt a modern viewer will get much pleasure from this movie. The premise is good enough for an action flick, but the execution just isn't very good.

    What a terrible film. It's interesting that the sequels have a reputation for lowering the standards of the series because this one is just as bad. The ropey plot, excruciating dialogue and terrible acting are outdone only by the atrocious animation effects - the finale looks as though someone accidentally spilled paint all over the negative. The almost demented incoherence with which this film has been flung together can be summed up by the fact that Christopher Lambert plays a Scot and Sean Connery plays a frickin' Spaniard! Who the hell cast this film? The only positives on display here are Russell Mulcahy's flashy direction and the inventive transitions between the flashbacks and the present day. There's nothing else on offer to keep you awake, and even the Queen songs are lousy.

    A Frenchman who is a Scots. A Scotsman who is Portuguese, songs by Queen, welcome to the world of Highlander. The film opens in New York and you soon go from a wrestling match to a sword fight. Via flashbacks we find out about Connor Macleod, how he has gone through the centuries making friends with immortals and fighting other immortals who are less than friendly in their search for the ultimate prize. As long as they do not lose their head, hence why they carry swords and try to decapitate each other in order to steal their power. We see Christopher Lambert falling in love, train with Sean Connery who explains to him, who he really is, duel with French aristocrats, fight Nazis and now in New York fight maybe the last remaining enemy, the evil Kurgen. The film was largely shot in the UK, at the time part of the film was like an extended pop promo, then again director Russell Mulcahy was better known for pop videos. The film was not a box office success but gained an audience on video. The film had a mix of a novel story, humour, violence, romance, songs, MTV style editing and rapidly gained a cult following. It is a classic.

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction. The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach. He has a tendency to use low shots, tracking shots and there was plenty of smoke and fog effects. New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites. When we see the battle in the Highlands looked very much like a music video, particularly with the Krugan dressed in a skull. The transitions to the flashbacks are done with tricks like pans, such as from a fish tank to a loch and the screen smashing like glass to go back to World War II. For an action film, Highlander is disappointing. The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands. When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Now first of all lets get the whole 'sequels' business out of the way. They're atrocious, boring, make no sense and were clearly spawned out of the imagination of over exuberant bankers! Now, for this amazing piece of work. Its brilliant. In every way, shape and form. The camera work is superb (and ahead of its time), the locations are excellently picked, the casting truly genius and the soundtrack and score truly fantastic (i may run out of superlatives by the end of this). *contains spoilers* The plot is unique given its part of the fantasy genre. Immortals born from no one knows or how (its never explained in the film), but yet none of this matters. They are invincible save for decapitation. They are drawn to one another till only one remains and this one immortal will gain 'the prize' infinite power and knowledge. Many have cast aspersions over the casting of Sean Connery as a Spanish/Egyptian who mentors our hero Christopher Lambert. But its superb, Connery is, as always, brilliant. Lambert is perfect as the Highlander from 'lots of different places'. But the real soup stealer is Clancy Brown as the Kurgen - he's the epitome of bad guy, knows he's powerful and takes full advantage,with no cage to bind him. The Queen soundtrack is incredible! Every song completes its scene. This is one of the best films ever made and certainly one of the best from the eighties. Yes its cheesy, yes its a bit camp, but boy does it do what films are supposed to do and really entertain!!

    Connor Macleod was born in 1518. After facing an evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, Macleod meets Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches him truth. He is immortal, and when one immortal takes the head of another, the loser's power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches Macleod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is killed by Connor's ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize, a signed copy of the soundtrack by Queen...... This has to be one of the strangest franchises of all time, and to be fair, the first movie really isn't the best thing, but what makes the franchise so popular is the notorious second entry, which is bad, but entertaining none the less. This is a good story, and a really good narrative, but Lambert is a really boring screen presence, spending the majority of the film staring into space with his boss eyes, while people like Connery, Brown and Imrie act him off the screen. If they had cast someone like Bridges, or even Liam Neeson, this could have been something special, rather than something that relies on a bad sequel to garner interest. All in all, its a great story, with some reasonable set pieces, but Lambert ruins it.

    I went in to this movie with low expectations,thinking it was going to be a bland adventure flick like "Conan:The Destroyer" or "Season of the witch".I was surprised to find out that "Highlander" is a very well made film.The idea is innovative,the story sucks you in very quickly and the acting is pretty good too.The film transitions between the modern time and the middle ages as it unfolds the history of our protagonist and the immortals as a whole.Plus there is a fantastic soundtrack to go along the way.The thing that kinda ruined the film for me were some of the unnecessarily long and over-the-top fight scenes,that served as an excuse to show off some fancy special effects,however,I admit,they were impressive for the time.I strongly recommend "Highlander",even to those who aren't adventure movie fans.

    I have seen this movie a few times, I still don't know why I don't see it more often? This isn't a bad movie by any stretch - it only got the reputation of being bad from the sequels(What sequels? Thats my attitude). I like the drama of this film as well as the swordplay. The drama is incredibly well set up, most people glorify immortality when Connor lost Heather, the woman he loved. The swordplay/action has to be spoken for. They are incredibly well choreographed, It should come as no surprise that the guy that made those fight scenes possible was the same guy that choreographed the fight scenes in Star Wars, the recent Zorro attempts and Pirates Of The Caribbean. Bob Anderson was a fantastic fencer, I know because I've been learning fencing for nearly 7 years. I call this one of the best films of the 1980's. I hope you enjoy it. Before I go I recommend the movie Highlander: The Search For Vengeance It is by far the best continuation of this series that it has ever had. I haven't seen the TV show though. I'm just throwing it out there.

    A Frenchman who is a Scots. A Scotsman who is Portuguese, songs by Queen, welcome to the world of Highlander. The film opens in New York and you soon go from a wrestling match to a sword fight. Via flashbacks we find out about Connor Macleod, how he has gone through the centuries making friends with immortals and fighting other immortals who are less than friendly in their search for the ultimate prize. As long as they do not lose their head, hence why they carry swords and try to decapitate each other in order to steal their power. We see Christopher Lambert falling in love, train with Sean Connery who explains to him, who he really is, duel with French aristocrats, fight Nazis and now in New York fight maybe the last remaining enemy, the evil Kurgen. The film was largely shot in the UK, at the time part of the film was like an extended pop promo, then again director Russell Mulcahy was better known for pop videos. The film was not a box office success but gained an audience on video. The film had a mix of a novel story, humour, violence, romance, songs, MTV style editing and rapidly gained a cult following. It is a classic.

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction. The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach. He has a tendency to use low shots, tracking shots and there was plenty of smoke and fog effects. New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites. When we see the battle in the Highlands looked very much like a music video, particularly with the Krugan dressed in a skull. The transitions to the flashbacks are done with tricks like pans, such as from a fish tank to a loch and the screen smashing like glass to go back to World War II. For an action film, Highlander is disappointing. The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands. When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Now first of all lets get the whole 'sequels' business out of the way. They're atrocious, boring, make no sense and were clearly spawned out of the imagination of over exuberant bankers! Now, for this amazing piece of work. Its brilliant. In every way, shape and form. The camera work is superb (and ahead of its time), the locations are excellently picked, the casting truly genius and the soundtrack and score truly fantastic (i may run out of superlatives by the end of this). *contains spoilers* The plot is unique given its part of the fantasy genre. Immortals born from no one knows or how (its never explained in the film), but yet none of this matters. They are invincible save for decapitation. They are drawn to one another till only one remains and this one immortal will gain 'the prize' infinite power and knowledge. Many have cast aspersions over the casting of Sean Connery as a Spanish/Egyptian who mentors our hero Christopher Lambert. But its superb, Connery is, as always, brilliant. Lambert is perfect as the Highlander from 'lots of different places'. But the real soup stealer is Clancy Brown as the Kurgen - he's the epitome of bad guy, knows he's powerful and takes full advantage,with no cage to bind him. The Queen soundtrack is incredible! Every song completes its scene. This is one of the best films ever made and certainly one of the best from the eighties. Yes its cheesy, yes its a bit camp, but boy does it do what films are supposed to do and really entertain!!

    Connor Macleod was born in 1518. After facing an evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, Macleod meets Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches him truth. He is immortal, and when one immortal takes the head of another, the loser's power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches Macleod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is killed by Connor's ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize, a signed copy of the soundtrack by Queen...... This has to be one of the strangest franchises of all time, and to be fair, the first movie really isn't the best thing, but what makes the franchise so popular is the notorious second entry, which is bad, but entertaining none the less. This is a good story, and a really good narrative, but Lambert is a really boring screen presence, spending the majority of the film staring into space with his boss eyes, while people like Connery, Brown and Imrie act him off the screen. If they had cast someone like Bridges, or even Liam Neeson, this could have been something special, rather than something that relies on a bad sequel to garner interest. All in all, its a great story, with some reasonable set pieces, but Lambert ruins it.

    I went in to this movie with low expectations,thinking it was going to be a bland adventure flick like "Conan:The Destroyer" or "Season of the witch".I was surprised to find out that "Highlander" is a very well made film.The idea is innovative,the story sucks you in very quickly and the acting is pretty good too.The film transitions between the modern time and the middle ages as it unfolds the history of our protagonist and the immortals as a whole.Plus there is a fantastic soundtrack to go along the way.The thing that kinda ruined the film for me were some of the unnecessarily long and over-the-top fight scenes,that served as an excuse to show off some fancy special effects,however,I admit,they were impressive for the time.I strongly recommend "Highlander",even to those who aren't adventure movie fans.

    I have seen this movie a few times, I still don't know why I don't see it more often? This isn't a bad movie by any stretch - it only got the reputation of being bad from the sequels(What sequels? Thats my attitude). I like the drama of this film as well as the swordplay. The drama is incredibly well set up, most people glorify immortality when Connor lost Heather, the woman he loved. The swordplay/action has to be spoken for. They are incredibly well choreographed, It should come as no surprise that the guy that made those fight scenes possible was the same guy that choreographed the fight scenes in Star Wars, the recent Zorro attempts and Pirates Of The Caribbean. Bob Anderson was a fantastic fencer, I know because I've been learning fencing for nearly 7 years. I call this one of the best films of the 1980's. I hope you enjoy it. Before I go I recommend the movie Highlander: The Search For Vengeance It is by far the best continuation of this series that it has ever had. I haven't seen the TV show though. I'm just throwing it out there.

    Highlander to me represents everything that is wrong with movies - cheesy acting, poor fight choreography, a share of pointless characters and motives, a lot of plot holes and really odd directional choices - yet for some reason I watch it every couple of weeks. Without spoiling it, the movie deals with a group of people who are deemed "immortal" and thus cannot die unless they are killed by another immortal. The last immortal standing wins the mysterious "prize" and I'll say no more than that, but be prepared for a lot of sword fighting, the immortals weapon of choice, simply because they can only be killed by loosing their heads - literally! There is something very charming in this film, and I can only really explain it in its pacing. This film has possibly some of the best editing and pacing in any movie. It sets up every scene well, we know who is doing what and why, it takes time to explain via flashbacks (poorly acted and shot flashbacks true!) all its concepts and meanings. At no point in the film are we ever confused as to what an "immortal" is, and it explains well concepts like "the quickening", granted these are incredibly stupid and bizarre concepts that are largely laughable, but the movie clearly isn't taking itself that seriously. One appeal of the movie is in itself its poor approach to acting. A lot has been said about how awful the acting is in this movie, yet for some reason I find it somewhat appropriate to the whole theme of the film. In some ways it adds laughable charm. The villain of the movie is delightfully over the top making him one of the films most appealing aspects. High art this is not, a well thought-out and developed, albeit it crappy story can always provide me with entrainment. I always recommend this movie simply because, to me at least, its a perfect example of a movie that has a silly idea, but sticks to its guns and delivers it so well. At no point does the movie ever cut its losses and even attempt to return to something conventional - and for that I have to give it credit!

    Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is banished from his Scottish village in the 16th century after surviving a fatal injury (and thus believed to be in league with the devil). He meets Ramirez (Sean Connery), who reveals they are both Immortals; he becomes a mentor for Connor, even teaching him swordsmanship. In the present day, all Immortals are drawn together and have to fight until only one is left... This very creative and entertaining 80's fantasy/adventure was created by Gregory Widen, who would later also make another excellent fantasy 'The Prophecy'. An excellent and creative mind he is, a pity he doesn't make many films or screenplays. The director, Russell Mulcahy, is a former music video director; as such, the action scenes are frantic and the film is quite fast-paced. Surprisingly, this is not a negative point here. 'Highlander' feels, in many ways, as two separate films: there is the modern storyline, and the past 'flashbacks' where most of the story aspects are detailed. The quality varies a lot between them, too. The past is the best part. The scenes are livelier, being actually shot in the Scottish Highlands; there is a substantial amount of character development and, despite Lambert's limited acting ability, Connor truly starts growing on the viewer. Furthermore, Sean Connery lends much charm and wit as the Immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez (who is Egyptian but acts like a Spaniard). It is in this part that Widen's ingenuity is at its best; even the special effects, while very dated even at the time, end up being somewhat charming. 9/10 On the other hand, the modern parts take place in New York. They are often nighttime scenes, with a gloomy and dark mood that reminds more of a dystopian reality than the run-down parts of New York. The action sequences are good, but the special effects this time around end up being a negative point; furthermore, a weak supporting cast (which includes Roxanne Hart and Alan North), as well as the Immortal villain played by Clancy Brown (whose better moments are fighting Connery in the past scenes) hinders this portion of the story. 5/10 The final fight and conclusion are decent, though, and appropriately concludes the story (tying together major plot points, while leaving enough questions to light the viewer's imagination). In both 'stories', there is a fun and often witty dialogue. Also an excellent soundtrack by Queen which includes 'A Kind of Magic' and the 'Highlander's trademark 'Who Wants to Live Forever'. This is one film that, even if not remembered as a masterpiece, will always remain a classic. 'There can only be one!' Why couldn't the producers follow the Immortals' advice, and stray from making the awful sequels that only ended up staining the original's reputation?

    After many years I watched again Highlander. I didn't remember much of it, except that the last time I saw it I came away with a so-so kind of impression. Well, this time it was worse. The movie, or I, didn't age well. Probably both. Obviously, it's an action flick, so the plot is paper thin, something to do with immortals trying to chop each other's heads off for reasons the writers had the good grace to mostly leave in the dark, and at some point the central conflict gets a little more personal anyway. The plot isn't the problem, by the standards of the genre it's as good as any. And, of course, being made in the 80ies there is only so much one can expect in terms of technical perfection. The fight scenes are a bit tedious, and the special effects funny, but that, too, isn't really the problem. One problem is that the acting is uniformly bad. In fact, it's been a while since I saw a cast that failed at their jobs in almost perfect harmony. To be fair, the script doesn't provide a awful lot of opportunity for great acting, but all major actors even fail at the most basic emotions, much less the few instances where some complexity might have been nice. In part that is also the fault of script, direction, and photography; a good example is a very emotional moment between our hero and his wife, which is filled with stilted monologue, quick glances at Lambert's expressionless face, and then sweeping landscape shots to illustrate the enormity of the emotion that the actor didn't. The story itself is confused, and the characters are difficult to care for, and cartoonish. A few immortals pop into (and often quickly out of, in ways that make a mockery of the concept of "immortal") the storyline, but we never really learn much about them (with the exception of a little bit of background on Connery's character). The modern love story is contrived and ludicrous, and as much just a pretext for a little bit of mild nudity and humping as the rest is for the fight scenes. It's a carelessly strung together collection of stuff that is best not taken too seriously. Another small annoyance is the music --- good pieces by Queen, but as a soundtrack to a movie too intrusive. I guess it might still work for fans, but I doubt a modern viewer will get much pleasure from this movie. The premise is good enough for an action flick, but the execution just isn't very good.

    What a terrible film. It's interesting that the sequels have a reputation for lowering the standards of the series because this one is just as bad. The ropey plot, excruciating dialogue and terrible acting are outdone only by the atrocious animation effects - the finale looks as though someone accidentally spilled paint all over the negative. The almost demented incoherence with which this film has been flung together can be summed up by the fact that Christopher Lambert plays a Scot and Sean Connery plays a frickin' Spaniard! Who the hell cast this film? The only positives on display here are Russell Mulcahy's flashy direction and the inventive transitions between the flashbacks and the present day. There's nothing else on offer to keep you awake, and even the Queen songs are lousy.

    A Frenchman who is a Scots. A Scotsman who is Portuguese, songs by Queen, welcome to the world of Highlander. The film opens in New York and you soon go from a wrestling match to a sword fight. Via flashbacks we find out about Connor Macleod, how he has gone through the centuries making friends with immortals and fighting other immortals who are less than friendly in their search for the ultimate prize. As long as they do not lose their head, hence why they carry swords and try to decapitate each other in order to steal their power. We see Christopher Lambert falling in love, train with Sean Connery who explains to him, who he really is, duel with French aristocrats, fight Nazis and now in New York fight maybe the last remaining enemy, the evil Kurgen. The film was largely shot in the UK, at the time part of the film was like an extended pop promo, then again director Russell Mulcahy was better known for pop videos. The film was not a box office success but gained an audience on video. The film had a mix of a novel story, humour, violence, romance, songs, MTV style editing and rapidly gained a cult following. It is a classic.

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks.

    Highlander to me represents everything that is wrong with movies - cheesy acting, poor fight choreography, a share of pointless characters and motives, a lot of plot holes and really odd directional choices - yet for some reason I watch it every couple of weeks. Without spoiling it, the movie deals with a group of people who are deemed "immortal" and thus cannot die unless they are killed by another immortal. The last immortal standing wins the mysterious "prize" and I'll say no more than that, but be prepared for a lot of sword fighting, the immortals weapon of choice, simply because they can only be killed by loosing their heads - literally! There is something very charming in this film, and I can only really explain it in its pacing. This film has possibly some of the best editing and pacing in any movie. It sets up every scene well, we know who is doing what and why, it takes time to explain via flashbacks (poorly acted and shot flashbacks true!) all its concepts and meanings. At no point in the film are we ever confused as to what an "immortal" is, and it explains well concepts like "the quickening", granted these are incredibly stupid and bizarre concepts that are largely laughable, but the movie clearly isn't taking itself that seriously. One appeal of the movie is in itself its poor approach to acting. A lot has been said about how awful the acting is in this movie, yet for some reason I find it somewhat appropriate to the whole theme of the film. In some ways it adds laughable charm. The villain of the movie is delightfully over the top making him one of the films most appealing aspects. High art this is not, a well thought-out and developed, albeit it crappy story can always provide me with entrainment. I always recommend this movie simply because, to me at least, its a perfect example of a movie that has a silly idea, but sticks to its guns and delivers it so well. At no point does the movie ever cut its losses and even attempt to return to something conventional - and for that I have to give it credit!

    Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is banished from his Scottish village in the 16th century after surviving a fatal injury (and thus believed to be in league with the devil). He meets Ramirez (Sean Connery), who reveals they are both Immortals; he becomes a mentor for Connor, even teaching him swordsmanship. In the present day, all Immortals are drawn together and have to fight until only one is left... This very creative and entertaining 80's fantasy/adventure was created by Gregory Widen, who would later also make another excellent fantasy 'The Prophecy'. An excellent and creative mind he is, a pity he doesn't make many films or screenplays. The director, Russell Mulcahy, is a former music video director; as such, the action scenes are frantic and the film is quite fast-paced. Surprisingly, this is not a negative point here. 'Highlander' feels, in many ways, as two separate films: there is the modern storyline, and the past 'flashbacks' where most of the story aspects are detailed. The quality varies a lot between them, too. The past is the best part. The scenes are livelier, being actually shot in the Scottish Highlands; there is a substantial amount of character development and, despite Lambert's limited acting ability, Connor truly starts growing on the viewer. Furthermore, Sean Connery lends much charm and wit as the Immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez (who is Egyptian but acts like a Spaniard). It is in this part that Widen's ingenuity is at its best; even the special effects, while very dated even at the time, end up being somewhat charming. 9/10 On the other hand, the modern parts take place in New York. They are often nighttime scenes, with a gloomy and dark mood that reminds more of a dystopian reality than the run-down parts of New York. The action sequences are good, but the special effects this time around end up being a negative point; furthermore, a weak supporting cast (which includes Roxanne Hart and Alan North), as well as the Immortal villain played by Clancy Brown (whose better moments are fighting Connery in the past scenes) hinders this portion of the story. 5/10 The final fight and conclusion are decent, though, and appropriately concludes the story (tying together major plot points, while leaving enough questions to light the viewer's imagination). In both 'stories', there is a fun and often witty dialogue. Also an excellent soundtrack by Queen which includes 'A Kind of Magic' and the 'Highlander's trademark 'Who Wants to Live Forever'. This is one film that, even if not remembered as a masterpiece, will always remain a classic. 'There can only be one!' Why couldn't the producers follow the Immortals' advice, and stray from making the awful sequels that only ended up staining the original's reputation?

    After many years I watched again Highlander. I didn't remember much of it, except that the last time I saw it I came away with a so-so kind of impression. Well, this time it was worse. The movie, or I, didn't age well. Probably both. Obviously, it's an action flick, so the plot is paper thin, something to do with immortals trying to chop each other's heads off for reasons the writers had the good grace to mostly leave in the dark, and at some point the central conflict gets a little more personal anyway. The plot isn't the problem, by the standards of the genre it's as good as any. And, of course, being made in the 80ies there is only so much one can expect in terms of technical perfection. The fight scenes are a bit tedious, and the special effects funny, but that, too, isn't really the problem. One problem is that the acting is uniformly bad. In fact, it's been a while since I saw a cast that failed at their jobs in almost perfect harmony. To be fair, the script doesn't provide a awful lot of opportunity for great acting, but all major actors even fail at the most basic emotions, much less the few instances where some complexity might have been nice. In part that is also the fault of script, direction, and photography; a good example is a very emotional moment between our hero and his wife, which is filled with stilted monologue, quick glances at Lambert's expressionless face, and then sweeping landscape shots to illustrate the enormity of the emotion that the actor didn't. The story itself is confused, and the characters are difficult to care for, and cartoonish. A few immortals pop into (and often quickly out of, in ways that make a mockery of the concept of "immortal") the storyline, but we never really learn much about them (with the exception of a little bit of background on Connery's character). The modern love story is contrived and ludicrous, and as much just a pretext for a little bit of mild nudity and humping as the rest is for the fight scenes. It's a carelessly strung together collection of stuff that is best not taken too seriously. Another small annoyance is the music --- good pieces by Queen, but as a soundtrack to a movie too intrusive. I guess it might still work for fans, but I doubt a modern viewer will get much pleasure from this movie. The premise is good enough for an action flick, but the execution just isn't very good.

    What a terrible film. It's interesting that the sequels have a reputation for lowering the standards of the series because this one is just as bad. The ropey plot, excruciating dialogue and terrible acting are outdone only by the atrocious animation effects - the finale looks as though someone accidentally spilled paint all over the negative. The almost demented incoherence with which this film has been flung together can be summed up by the fact that Christopher Lambert plays a Scot and Sean Connery plays a frickin' Spaniard! Who the hell cast this film? The only positives on display here are Russell Mulcahy's flashy direction and the inventive transitions between the flashbacks and the present day. There's nothing else on offer to keep you awake, and even the Queen songs are lousy.

    A Frenchman who is a Scots. A Scotsman who is Portuguese, songs by Queen, welcome to the world of Highlander. The film opens in New York and you soon go from a wrestling match to a sword fight. Via flashbacks we find out about Connor Macleod, how he has gone through the centuries making friends with immortals and fighting other immortals who are less than friendly in their search for the ultimate prize. As long as they do not lose their head, hence why they carry swords and try to decapitate each other in order to steal their power. We see Christopher Lambert falling in love, train with Sean Connery who explains to him, who he really is, duel with French aristocrats, fight Nazis and now in New York fight maybe the last remaining enemy, the evil Kurgen. The film was largely shot in the UK, at the time part of the film was like an extended pop promo, then again director Russell Mulcahy was better known for pop videos. The film was not a box office success but gained an audience on video. The film had a mix of a novel story, humour, violence, romance, songs, MTV style editing and rapidly gained a cult following. It is a classic.

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction. The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach. He has a tendency to use low shots, tracking shots and there was plenty of smoke and fog effects. New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites. When we see the battle in the Highlands looked very much like a music video, particularly with the Krugan dressed in a skull. The transitions to the flashbacks are done with tricks like pans, such as from a fish tank to a loch and the screen smashing like glass to go back to World War II. For an action film, Highlander is disappointing. The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands. When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Now first of all lets get the whole 'sequels' business out of the way. They're atrocious, boring, make no sense and were clearly spawned out of the imagination of over exuberant bankers! Now, for this amazing piece of work. Its brilliant. In every way, shape and form. The camera work is superb (and ahead of its time), the locations are excellently picked, the casting truly genius and the soundtrack and score truly fantastic (i may run out of superlatives by the end of this). *contains spoilers* The plot is unique given its part of the fantasy genre. Immortals born from no one knows or how (its never explained in the film), but yet none of this matters. They are invincible save for decapitation. They are drawn to one another till only one remains and this one immortal will gain 'the prize' infinite power and knowledge. Many have cast aspersions over the casting of Sean Connery as a Spanish/Egyptian who mentors our hero Christopher Lambert. But its superb, Connery is, as always, brilliant. Lambert is perfect as the Highlander from 'lots of different places'. But the real soup stealer is Clancy Brown as the Kurgen - he's the epitome of bad guy, knows he's powerful and takes full advantage,with no cage to bind him. The Queen soundtrack is incredible! Every song completes its scene. This is one of the best films ever made and certainly one of the best from the eighties. Yes its cheesy, yes its a bit camp, but boy does it do what films are supposed to do and really entertain!!

    Connor Macleod was born in 1518. After facing an evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, Macleod meets Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches him truth. He is immortal, and when one immortal takes the head of another, the loser's power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches Macleod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is killed by Connor's ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize, a signed copy of the soundtrack by Queen...... This has to be one of the strangest franchises of all time, and to be fair, the first movie really isn't the best thing, but what makes the franchise so popular is the notorious second entry, which is bad, but entertaining none the less. This is a good story, and a really good narrative, but Lambert is a really boring screen presence, spending the majority of the film staring into space with his boss eyes, while people like Connery, Brown and Imrie act him off the screen. If they had cast someone like Bridges, or even Liam Neeson, this could have been something special, rather than something that relies on a bad sequel to garner interest. All in all, its a great story, with some reasonable set pieces, but Lambert ruins it.

    I went in to this movie with low expectations,thinking it was going to be a bland adventure flick like "Conan:The Destroyer" or "Season of the witch".I was surprised to find out that "Highlander" is a very well made film.The idea is innovative,the story sucks you in very quickly and the acting is pretty good too.The film transitions between the modern time and the middle ages as it unfolds the history of our protagonist and the immortals as a whole.Plus there is a fantastic soundtrack to go along the way.The thing that kinda ruined the film for me were some of the unnecessarily long and over-the-top fight scenes,that served as an excuse to show off some fancy special effects,however,I admit,they were impressive for the time.I strongly recommend "Highlander",even to those who aren't adventure movie fans.

    I have seen this movie a few times, I still don't know why I don't see it more often? This isn't a bad movie by any stretch - it only got the reputation of being bad from the sequels(What sequels? Thats my attitude). I like the drama of this film as well as the swordplay. The drama is incredibly well set up, most people glorify immortality when Connor lost Heather, the woman he loved. The swordplay/action has to be spoken for. They are incredibly well choreographed, It should come as no surprise that the guy that made those fight scenes possible was the same guy that choreographed the fight scenes in Star Wars, the recent Zorro attempts and Pirates Of The Caribbean. Bob Anderson was a fantastic fencer, I know because I've been learning fencing for nearly 7 years. I call this one of the best films of the 1980's. I hope you enjoy it. Before I go I recommend the movie Highlander: The Search For Vengeance It is by far the best continuation of this series that it has ever had. I haven't seen the TV show though. I'm just throwing it out there.

    Highlander to me represents everything that is wrong with movies - cheesy acting, poor fight choreography, a share of pointless characters and motives, a lot of plot holes and really odd directional choices - yet for some reason I watch it every couple of weeks. Without spoiling it, the movie deals with a group of people who are deemed "immortal" and thus cannot die unless they are killed by another immortal. The last immortal standing wins the mysterious "prize" and I'll say no more than that, but be prepared for a lot of sword fighting, the immortals weapon of choice, simply because they can only be killed by loosing their heads - literally! There is something very charming in this film, and I can only really explain it in its pacing. This film has possibly some of the best editing and pacing in any movie. It sets up every scene well, we know who is doing what and why, it takes time to explain via flashbacks (poorly acted and shot flashbacks true!) all its concepts and meanings. At no point in the film are we ever confused as to what an "immortal" is, and it explains well concepts like "the quickening", granted these are incredibly stupid and bizarre concepts that are largely laughable, but the movie clearly isn't taking itself that seriously. One appeal of the movie is in itself its poor approach to acting. A lot has been said about how awful the acting is in this movie, yet for some reason I find it somewhat appropriate to the whole theme of the film. In some ways it adds laughable charm. The villain of the movie is delightfully over the top making him one of the films most appealing aspects. High art this is not, a well thought-out and developed, albeit it crappy story can always provide me with entrainment. I always recommend this movie simply because, to me at least, its a perfect example of a movie that has a silly idea, but sticks to its guns and delivers it so well.

This very creative and entertaining 80's fantasy/adventure was created by Gregory Widen, who would later also make another excellent fantasy 'The Prophecy'. An excellent and creative mind he is, a pity he doesn't make many films or screenplays.

It is in this part that Widen's ingenuity is at its best; even the special effects, while very dated even at the time, end up being somewhat charming. 9/10 On the other hand, the modern parts take place in New York. They are often nighttime scenes, with a gloomy and dark mood that reminds more of a dystopian reality than the run-down parts of New York. The action sequences are good, but the special effects this time around end up being a negative point; furthermore, a weak supporting cast (which includes Roxanne Hart and Alan North), as well as the Immortal villain played by Clancy Brown (whose better moments are fighting Connery in the past scenes) hinders this portion of the story. 5/10 The final fight and conclusion are decent, though, and appropriately concludes the story (tying together major plot points, while leaving enough questions to light the viewer's imagination). In both 'stories', there is a fun and often witty dialogue. Also an excellent soundtrack by Queen which includes 'A Kind of Magic' and the 'Highlander's trademark 'Who Wants to Live Forever'. This is one film that, even if not remembered as a masterpiece, will always remain a classic. 'There can only be one!' Why couldn't the producers follow the Immortals' advice, and stray from making the awful sequels that only ended up staining the original's reputation?

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction.

The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands. When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Now first of all lets get the whole 'sequels' business out of the way. They're atrocious, boring, make no sense and were clearly spawned out of the imagination of over exuberant bankers! Now, for this amazing piece of work. Its brilliant. In every way, shape and form. The camera work is superb (and ahead of its time), the locations are excellently picked, the casting truly genius and the soundtrack and score truly fantastic (i may run out of superlatives by the end of this). *contains spoilers* The plot is unique given its part of the fantasy genre. Immortals born from no one knows or how (its never explained in the film), but yet none of this matters. They are invincible save for decapitation. They are drawn to one another till only one remains and this one immortal will gain 'the prize' infinite power and knowledge. Many have cast aspersions over the casting of Sean Connery as a Spanish/Egyptian who mentors our hero Christopher Lambert. But its superb, Connery is, as always, brilliant. Lambert is perfect as the Highlander from 'lots of different places'. But the real soup stealer is Clancy Brown as the Kurgen - he's the epitome of bad guy, knows he's powerful and takes full advantage,with no cage to bind him. The Queen soundtrack is incredible! Every song completes its scene. This is one of the best films ever made and certainly one of the best from the eighties. Yes its cheesy, yes its a bit camp, but boy does it do what films are supposed to do and really entertain!!

    Connor Macleod was born in 1518. After facing an evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, Macleod meets Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches him truth. He is immortal, and when one immortal takes the head of another, the loser's power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches Macleod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is killed by Connor's ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize, a signed copy of the soundtrack by Queen...... This has to be one of the strangest franchises of all time, and to be fair, the first movie really isn't the best thing, but what makes the franchise so popular is the notorious second entry, which is bad, but entertaining none the less. This is a good story, and a really good narrative, but Lambert is a really boring screen presence, spending the majority of the film staring into space with his boss eyes, while people like Connery, Brown and Imrie act him off the screen. If they had cast someone like Bridges, or even Liam Neeson, this could have been something special, rather than something that relies on a bad sequel to garner interest. All in all, its a great story, with some reasonable set pieces, but Lambert ruins it.

    I went in to this movie with low expectations,thinking it was going to be a bland adventure flick like "Conan:The Destroyer" or "Season of the witch".I was surprised to find out that "Highlander" is a very well made film.The idea is innovative,the story sucks you in very quickly and the acting is pretty good too.The film transitions between the modern time and the middle ages as it unfolds the history of our protagonist and the immortals as a whole.Plus there is a fantastic soundtrack to go along the way.The thing that kinda ruined the film for me were some of the unnecessarily long and over-the-top fight scenes,that served as an excuse to show off some fancy special effects,however,I admit,they were impressive for the time.I strongly recommend "Highlander",even to those who aren't adventure movie fans.

    I have seen this movie a few times, I still don't know why I don't see it more often? This isn't a bad movie by any stretch - it only got the reputation of being bad from the sequels(What sequels? Thats my attitude). I like the drama of this film as well as the swordplay. The drama is incredibly well set up, most people glorify immortality when Connor lost Heather, the woman he loved. The swordplay/action has to be spoken for. They are incredibly well choreographed, It should come as no surprise that the guy that made those fight scenes possible was the same guy that choreographed the fight scenes in Star Wars, the recent Zorro attempts and Pirates Of The Caribbean. Bob Anderson was a fantastic fencer, I know because I've been learning fencing for nearly 7 years. I call this one of the best films of the 1980's. I hope you enjoy it. Before I go I recommend the movie Highlander: The Search For Vengeance It is by far the best continuation of this series that it has ever had. I haven't seen the TV show though. I'm just throwing it out there.

    Highlander to me represents everything that is wrong with movies - cheesy acting, poor fight choreography, a share of pointless characters and motives, a lot of plot holes and really odd directional choices - yet for some reason I watch it every couple of weeks. Without spoiling it, the movie deals with a group of people who are deemed "immortal" and thus cannot die unless they are killed by another immortal. The last immortal standing wins the mysterious "prize" and I'll say no more than that, but be prepared for a lot of sword fighting, the immortals weapon of choice, simply because they can only be killed by loosing their heads - literally! There is something very charming in this film, and I can only really explain it in its pacing. This film has possibly some of the best editing and pacing in any movie. It sets up every scene well, we know who is doing what and why, it takes time to explain via flashbacks (poorly acted and shot flashbacks true!) all its concepts and meanings. At no point in the film are we ever confused as to what an "immortal" is, and it explains well concepts like "the quickening", granted these are incredibly stupid and bizarre concepts that are largely laughable, but the movie clearly isn't taking itself that seriously. One appeal of the movie is in itself its poor approach to acting. A lot has been said about how awful the acting is in this movie, yet for some reason I find it somewhat appropriate to the whole theme of the film. In some ways it adds laughable charm. The villain of the movie is delightfully over the top making him one of the films most appealing aspects. High art this is not, a well thought-out and developed, albeit it crappy story can always provide me with entrainment. I always recommend this movie simply because, to me at least, its a perfect example of a movie that has a silly idea, but sticks to its guns and delivers it so well. At no point does the movie ever cut its losses and even attempt to return to something conventional - and for that I have to give it credit!

    Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is banished from his Scottish village in the 16th century after surviving a fatal injury (and thus believed to be in league with the devil). He meets Ramirez (Sean Connery), who reveals they are both Immortals; he becomes a mentor for Connor, even teaching him swordsmanship. In the present day, all Immortals are drawn together and have to fight until only one is left... This very creative and entertaining 80's fantasy/adventure was created by Gregory Widen, who would later also make another excellent fantasy 'The Prophecy'. An excellent and creative mind he is, a pity he doesn't make many films or screenplays. The director, Russell Mulcahy, is a former music video director; as such, the action scenes are frantic and the film is quite fast-paced. Surprisingly, this is not a negative point here. 'Highlander' feels, in many ways, as two separate films: there is the modern storyline, and the past 'flashbacks' where most of the story aspects are detailed. The quality varies a lot between them, too. The past is the best part. The scenes are livelier, being actually shot in the Scottish Highlands; there is a substantial amount of character development and, despite Lambert's limited acting ability, Connor truly starts growing on the viewer. Furthermore, Sean Connery lends much charm and wit as the Immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez (who is Egyptian but acts like a Spaniard). It is in this part that Widen's ingenuity is at its best; even the special effects, while very dated even at the time, end up being somewhat charming. 9/10 On the other hand, the modern parts take place in New York. They are often nighttime scenes, with a gloomy and dark mood that reminds more of a dystopian reality than the run-down parts of New York. The action sequences are good, but the special effects this time around end up being a negative point; furthermore, a weak supporting cast (which includes Roxanne Hart and Alan North), as well as the Immortal villain played by Clancy Brown (whose better moments are fighting Connery in the past scenes) hinders this portion of the story. 5/10 The final fight and conclusion are decent, though, and appropriately concludes the story (tying together major plot points, while leaving enough questions to light the viewer's imagination). In both 'stories', there is a fun and often witty dialogue. Also an excellent soundtrack by Queen which includes 'A Kind of Magic' and the 'Highlander's trademark 'Who Wants to Live Forever'. This is one film that, even if not remembered as a masterpiece, will always remain a classic. 'There can only be one!' Why couldn't the producers follow the Immortals' advice, and stray from making the awful sequels that only ended up staining the original's reputation?

    After many years I watched again Highlander. I didn't remember much of it, except that the last time I saw it I came away with a so-so kind of impression. Well, this time it was worse. The movie, or I, didn't age well. Probably both. Obviously, it's an action flick, so the plot is paper thin, something to do with immortals trying to chop each other's heads off for reasons the writers had the good grace to mostly leave in the dark, and at some point the central conflict gets a little more personal anyway. The plot isn't the problem, by the standards of the genre it's as good as any. And, of course, being made in the 80ies there is only so much one can expect in terms of technical perfection. The fight scenes are a bit tedious, and the special effects funny, but that, too, isn't really the problem. One problem is that the acting is uniformly bad. In fact, it's been a while since I saw a cast that failed at their jobs in almost perfect harmony. To be fair, the script doesn't provide a awful lot of opportunity for great acting, but all major actors even fail at the most basic emotions, much less the few instances where some complexity might have been nice. In part that is also the fault of script, direction, and photography; a good example is a very emotional moment between our hero and his wife, which is filled with stilted monologue, quick glances at Lambert's expressionless face, and then sweeping landscape shots to illustrate the enormity of the emotion that the actor didn't. The story itself is confused, and the characters are difficult to care for, and cartoonish. A few immortals pop into (and often quickly out of, in ways that make a mockery of the concept of "immortal") the storyline, but we never really learn much about them (with the exception of a little bit of background on Connery's character). The modern love story is contrived and ludicrous, and as much just a pretext for a little bit of mild nudity and humping as the rest is for the fight scenes. It's a carelessly strung together collection of stuff that is best not taken too seriously. Another small annoyance is the music --- good pieces by Queen, but as a soundtrack to a movie too intrusive. I guess it might still work for fans, but I doubt a modern viewer will get much pleasure from this movie. The premise is good enough for an action flick, but the execution just isn't very good.

    What a terrible film. It's interesting that the sequels have a reputation for lowering the standards of the series because this one is just as bad. The ropey plot, excruciating dialogue and terrible acting are outdone only by the atrocious animation effects - the finale looks as though someone accidentally spilled paint all over the negative. The almost demented incoherence with which this film has been flung together can be summed up by the fact that Christopher Lambert plays a Scot and Sean Connery plays a frickin' Spaniard! Who the hell cast this film? The only positives on display here are Russell Mulcahy's flashy direction and the inventive transitions between the flashbacks and the present day. There's nothing else on offer to keep you awake, and even the Queen songs are lousy.

    A Frenchman who is a Scots. A Scotsman who is Portuguese, songs by Queen, welcome to the world of Highlander. The film opens in New York and you soon go from a wrestling match to a sword fight. Via flashbacks we find out about Connor Macleod, how he has gone through the centuries making friends with immortals and fighting other immortals who are less than friendly in their search for the ultimate prize. As long as they do not lose their head, hence why they carry swords and try to decapitate each other in order to steal their power. We see Christopher Lambert falling in love, train with Sean Connery who explains to him, who he really is, duel with French aristocrats, fight Nazis and now in New York fight maybe the last remaining enemy, the evil Kurgen. The film was largely shot in the UK, at the time part of the film was like an extended pop promo, then again director Russell Mulcahy was better known for pop videos. The film was not a box office success but gained an audience on video. The film had a mix of a novel story, humour, violence, romance, songs, MTV style editing and rapidly gained a cult following. It is a classic.

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction. The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach. He has a tendency to use low shots, tracking shots and there was plenty of smoke and fog effects. New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites. When we see the battle in the Highlands looked very much like a music video, particularly with the Krugan dressed in a skull. The transitions to the flashbacks are done with tricks like pans, such as from a fish tank to a loch and the screen smashing like glass to go back to World War II. For an action film, Highlander is disappointing. The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands. When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Highlander to me represents everything that is wrong with movies - cheesy acting, poor fight choreography, a share of pointless characters and motives, a lot of plot holes and really odd directional choices - yet for some reason I watch it every couple of weeks. Without spoiling it, the movie deals with a group of people who are deemed "immortal" and thus cannot die unless they are killed by another immortal. The last immortal standing wins the mysterious "prize" and I'll say no more than that, but be prepared for a lot of sword fighting, the immortals weapon of choice, simply because they can only be killed by loosing their heads - literally! There is something very charming in this film, and I can only really explain it in its pacing. This film has possibly some of the best editing and pacing in any movie. It sets up every scene well, we know who is doing what and why, it takes time to explain via flashbacks (poorly acted and shot flashbacks true!) all its concepts and meanings. At no point in the film are we ever confused as to what an "immortal" is, and it explains well concepts like "the quickening", granted these are incredibly stupid and bizarre concepts that are largely laughable, but the movie clearly isn't taking itself that seriously.

    Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is banished from his Scottish village in the 16th century after surviving a fatal injury (and thus believed to be in league with the devil). He meets Ramirez (Sean Connery), who reveals they are both Immortals; he becomes a mentor for Connor, even teaching him swordsmanship. In the present day, all Immortals are drawn together and have to fight until only one is left... This very creative and entertaining 80's fantasy/adventure was created by Gregory Widen, who would later also make another excellent fantasy 'The Prophecy'. An excellent and creative mind he is, a pity he doesn't make many films or screenplays. The director, Russell Mulcahy, is a former music video director; as such, the action scenes are frantic and the film is quite fast-paced. Surprisingly, this is not a negative point here. 'Highlander' feels, in many ways, as two separate films: there is the modern storyline, and the past 'flashbacks' where most of the story aspects are detailed. The quality varies a lot between them, too. The past is the best part. The scenes are livelier, being actually shot in the Scottish Highlands; there is a substantial amount of character development and, despite Lambert's limited acting ability, Connor truly starts growing on the viewer. Furthermore, Sean Connery lends much charm and wit as the Immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez (who is Egyptian but acts like a Spaniard). It is in this part that Widen's ingenuity is at its best; even the special effects, while very dated even at the time, end up being somewhat charming. 9/10 On the other hand, the modern parts take place in New York. They are often nighttime scenes, with a gloomy and dark mood that reminds more of a dystopian reality than the run-down parts of New York. The action sequences are good, but the special effects this time around end up being a negative point; furthermore, a weak supporting cast (which includes Roxanne Hart and Alan North), as well as the Immortal villain played by Clancy Brown (whose better moments are fighting Connery in the past scenes) hinders this portion of the story. 5/10 The final fight and conclusion are decent, though, and appropriately concludes the story (tying together major plot points, while leaving enough questions to light the viewer's imagination). In both 'stories', there is a fun and often witty dialogue. Also an excellent soundtrack by Queen which includes 'A Kind of Magic' and the 'Highlander's trademark 'Who Wants to Live Forever'. This is one film that, even if not remembered as a masterpiece, will always remain a classic. 'There can only be one!' Why couldn't the producers follow the Immortals' advice, and stray from making the awful sequels that only ended up staining the original's reputation?

    After many years I watched again Highlander. I didn't remember much of it, except that the last time I saw it I came away with a so-so kind of impression. Well, this time it was worse. The movie, or I, didn't age well. Probably both. Obviously, it's an action flick, so the plot is paper thin, something to do with immortals trying to chop each other's heads off for reasons the writers had the good grace to mostly leave in the dark, and at some point the central conflict gets a little more personal anyway. The plot isn't the problem, by the standards of the genre it's as good as any. And, of course, being made in the 80ies there is only so much one can expect in terms of technical perfection. The fight scenes are a bit tedious, and the special effects funny, but that, too, isn't really the problem. One problem is that the acting is uniformly bad. In fact, it's been a while since I saw a cast that failed at their jobs in almost perfect harmony. To be fair, the script doesn't provide a awful lot of opportunity for great acting, but all major actors even fail at the most basic emotions, much less the few instances where some complexity might have been nice. In part that is also the fault of script, direction, and photography; a good example is a very emotional moment between our hero and his wife, which is filled with stilted monologue, quick glances at Lambert's expressionless face, and then sweeping landscape shots to illustrate the enormity of the emotion that the actor didn't. The story itself is confused, and the characters are difficult to care for, and cartoonish. A few immortals pop into (and often quickly out of, in ways that make a mockery of the concept of "immortal") the storyline, but we never really learn much about them (with the exception of a little bit of background on Connery's character). The modern love story is contrived and ludicrous, and as much just a pretext for a little bit of mild nudity and humping as the rest is for the fight scenes. It's a carelessly strung together collection of stuff that is best not taken too seriously. Another small annoyance is the music --- good pieces by Queen, but as a soundtrack to a movie too intrusive. I guess it might still work for fans, but I doubt a modern viewer will get much pleasure from this movie. The premise is good enough for an action flick, but the execution just isn't very good.

    What a terrible film. It's interesting that the sequels have a reputation for lowering the standards of the series because this one is just as bad. The ropey plot, excruciating dialogue and terrible acting are outdone only by the atrocious animation effects - the finale looks as though someone accidentally spilled paint all over the negative. The almost demented incoherence with which this film has been flung together can be summed up by the fact that Christopher Lambert plays a Scot and Sean Connery plays a frickin' Spaniard! Who the hell cast this film? The only positives on display here are Russell Mulcahy's flashy direction and the inventive transitions between the flashbacks and the present day. There's nothing else on offer to keep you awake, and even the Queen songs are lousy.

    A Frenchman who is a Scots. A Scotsman who is Portuguese, songs by Queen, welcome to the world of Highlander. The film opens in New York and you soon go from a wrestling match to a sword fight. Via flashbacks we find out about Connor Macleod, how he has gone through the centuries making friends with immortals and fighting other immortals who are less than friendly in their search for the ultimate prize. As long as they do not lose their head, hence why they carry swords and try to decapitate each other in order to steal their power. We see Christopher Lambert falling in love, train with Sean Connery who explains to him, who he really is, duel with French aristocrats, fight Nazis and now in New York fight maybe the last remaining enemy, the evil Kurgen. The film was largely shot in the UK, at the time part of the film was like an extended pop promo, then again director Russell Mulcahy was better known for pop videos. The film was not a box office success but gained an audience on video. The film had a mix of a novel story, humour, violence, romance, songs, MTV style editing and rapidly gained a cult following. It is a classic.

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction. The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach. He has a tendency to use low shots, tracking shots and there was plenty of smoke and fog effects. New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites. When we see the battle in the Highlands looked very much like a music video, particularly with the Krugan dressed in a skull. The transitions to the flashbacks are done with tricks like pans, such as from a fish tank to a loch and the screen smashing like glass to go back to World War II. For an action film, Highlander is disappointing. The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands. When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Now first of all lets get the whole 'sequels' business out of the way. They're atrocious, boring, make no sense and were clearly spawned out of the imagination of over exuberant bankers! Now, for this amazing piece of work. Its brilliant. In every way, shape and form. The camera work is superb (and ahead of its time), the locations are excellently picked, the casting truly genius and the soundtrack and score truly fantastic (i may run out of superlatives by the end of this). *contains spoilers* The plot is unique given its part of the fantasy genre. Immortals born from no one knows or how (its never explained in the film), but yet none of this matters. They are invincible save for decapitation. They are drawn to one another till only one remains and this one immortal will gain 'the prize' infinite power and knowledge. Many have cast aspersions over the casting of Sean Connery as a Spanish/Egyptian who mentors our hero Christopher Lambert. But its superb, Connery is, as always, brilliant. Lambert is perfect as the Highlander from 'lots of different places'. But the real soup stealer is Clancy Brown as the Kurgen - he's the epitome of bad guy, knows he's powerful and takes full advantage,with no cage to bind him. The Queen soundtrack is incredible! Every song completes its scene. This is one of the best films ever made and certainly one of the best from the eighties. Yes its cheesy, yes its a bit camp, but boy does it do what films are supposed to do and really entertain!!

    Connor Macleod was born in 1518. After facing an evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, Macleod meets Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches him truth. He is immortal, and when one immortal takes the head of another, the loser's power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches Macleod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is killed by Connor's ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize, a signed copy of the soundtrack by Queen...... This has to be one of the strangest franchises of all time, and to be fair, the first movie really isn't the best thing, but what makes the franchise so popular is the notorious second entry, which is bad, but entertaining none the less. This is a good story, and a really good narrative, but Lambert is a really boring screen presence, spending the majority of the film staring into space with his boss eyes, while people like Connery, Brown and Imrie act him off the screen. If they had cast someone like Bridges, or even Liam Neeson, this could have been something special, rather than something that relies on a bad sequel to garner interest. All in all, its a great story, with some reasonable set pieces, but Lambert ruins it.

    I went in to this movie with low expectations,thinking it was going to be a bland adventure flick like "Conan:The Destroyer" or "Season of the witch".I was surprised to find out that "Highlander" is a very well made film.The idea is innovative,the story sucks you in very quickly and the acting is pretty good too.The film transitions between the modern time and the middle ages as it unfolds the history of our protagonist and the immortals as a whole.Plus there is a fantastic soundtrack to go along the way.The thing that kinda ruined the film for me were some of the unnecessarily long and over-the-top fight scenes,that served as an excuse to show off some fancy special effects,however,I admit,they were impressive for the time.I strongly recommend "Highlander",even to those who aren't adventure movie fans.

    I have seen this movie a few times, I still don't know why I don't see it more often? This isn't a bad movie by any stretch - it only got the reputation of being bad from the sequels(What sequels? Thats my attitude). I like the drama of this film as well as the swordplay. The drama is incredibly well set up, most people glorify immortality when Connor lost Heather, the woman he loved. The swordplay/action has to be spoken for. They are incredibly well choreographed, It should come as no surprise that the guy that made those fight scenes possible was the same guy that choreographed the fight scenes in Star Wars, the recent Zorro attempts and Pirates Of The Caribbean. Bob Anderson was a fantastic fencer, I know because I've been learning fencing for nearly 7 years. I call this one of the best films of the 1980's. I hope you enjoy it. Before I go I recommend the movie Highlander: The Search For Vengeance It is by far the best continuation of this series that it has ever had. I haven't seen the TV show though. I'm just throwing it out there.

    Highlander to me represents everything that is wrong with movies - cheesy acting, poor fight choreography, a share of pointless characters and motives, a lot of plot holes and really odd directional choices - yet for some reason I watch it every couple of weeks. Without spoiling it, the movie deals with a group of people who are deemed "immortal" and thus cannot die unless they are killed by another immortal. The last immortal standing wins the mysterious "prize" and I'll say no more than that, but be prepared for a lot of sword fighting, the immortals weapon of choice, simply because they can only be killed by loosing their heads - literally! There is something very charming in this film, and I can only really explain it in its pacing. This film has possibly some of the best editing and pacing in any movie. It sets up every scene well, we know who is doing what and why, it takes time to explain via flashbacks (poorly acted and shot flashbacks true!) all its concepts and meanings. At no point in the film are we ever confused as to what an "immortal" is, and it explains well concepts like "the quickening", granted these are incredibly stupid and bizarre concepts that are largely laughable, but the movie clearly isn't taking itself that seriously. One appeal of the movie is in itself its poor approach to acting. A lot has been said about how awful the acting is in this movie, yet for some reason I find it somewhat appropriate to the whole theme of the film. In some ways it adds laughable charm. The villain of the movie is delightfully over the top making him one of the films most appealing aspects. High art this is not, a well thought-out and developed, albeit it crappy story can always provide me with entrainment. I always recommend this movie simply because, to me at least, its a perfect example of a movie that has a silly idea, but sticks to its guns and delivers it so well. At no point does the movie ever cut its losses and even attempt to return to something conventional - and for that I have to give it credit!

    Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is banished from his Scottish village in the 16th century after surviving a fatal injury (and thus believed to be in league with the devil). He meets Ramirez (Sean Connery), who reveals they are both Immortals; he becomes a mentor for Connor, even teaching him swordsmanship. In the present day, all Immortals are drawn together and have to fight until only one is left... This very creative and entertaining 80's fantasy/adventure was created by Gregory Widen, who would later also make another excellent fantasy 'The Prophecy'. An excellent and creative mind he is, a pity he doesn't make many films or screenplays. The director, Russell Mulcahy, is a former music video director; as such, the action scenes are frantic and the film is quite fast-paced. Surprisingly, this is not a negative point here. 'Highlander' feels, in many ways, as two separate films: there is the modern storyline, and the past 'flashbacks' where most of the story aspects are detailed. The quality varies a lot between them, too. The past is the best part. The scenes are livelier, being actually shot in the Scottish Highlands; there is a substantial amount of character development and, despite Lambert's limited acting ability, Connor truly starts growing on the viewer. Furthermore, Sean Connery lends much charm and wit as the Immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez (who is Egyptian but acts like a Spaniard). It is in this part that Widen's ingenuity is at its best; even the special effects, while very dated even at the time, end up being somewhat charming. 9/10 On the other hand, the modern parts take place in New York. They are often nighttime scenes, with a gloomy and dark mood that reminds more of a dystopian reality than the run-down parts of New York. The action sequences are good, but the special effects this time around end up being a negative point; furthermore, a weak supporting cast (which includes Roxanne Hart and Alan North), as well as the Immortal villain played by Clancy Brown (whose better moments are fighting Connery in the past scenes) hinders this portion of the story. 5/10 The final fight and conclusion are decent, though, and appropriately concludes the story (tying together major plot points, while leaving enough questions to light the viewer's imagination). In both 'stories', there is a fun and often witty dialogue. Also an excellent soundtrack by Queen which includes 'A Kind of Magic' and the 'Highlander's trademark 'Who Wants to Live Forever'. This is one film that, even if not remembered as a masterpiece, will always remain a classic. 'There can only be one!' Why couldn't the producers follow the Immortals' advice, and stray from making the awful sequels that only ended up staining the original's reputation?

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction. The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach.

New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites.

The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands.

In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Connor Macleod was born in 1518. After facing an evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, Macleod meets Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches him truth. He is immortal, and when one immortal takes the head of another, the loser's power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches Macleod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is killed by Connor's ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize, a signed copy of the soundtrack by Queen...... This has to be one of the strangest franchises of all time, and to be fair, the first movie really isn't the best thing, but what makes the franchise so popular is the notorious second entry, which is bad, but entertaining none the less. This is a good story, and a really good narrative, but Lambert is a really boring screen presence, spending the majority of the film staring into space with his boss eyes, while people like Connery, Brown and Imrie act him off the screen. If they had cast someone like Bridges, or even Liam Neeson, this could have been something special, rather than something that relies on a bad sequel to garner interest. All in all, its a great story, with some reasonable set pieces, but Lambert ruins it.

    I went in to this movie with low expectations,thinking it was going to be a bland adventure flick like "Conan:The Destroyer" or "Season of the witch".I was surprised to find out that "Highlander" is a very well made film.The idea is innovative,the story sucks you in very quickly and the acting is pretty good too.The film transitions between the modern time and the middle ages as it unfolds the history of our protagonist and the immortals as a whole.Plus there is a fantastic soundtrack to go along the way.The thing that kinda ruined the film for me were some of the unnecessarily long and over-the-top fight scenes,that served as an excuse to show off some fancy special effects,however,I admit,they were impressive for the time.I strongly recommend "Highlander",even to those who aren't adventure movie fans.

    I have seen this movie a few times, I still don't know why I don't see it more often? This isn't a bad movie by any stretch - it only got the reputation of being bad from the sequels(What sequels? Thats my attitude). I like the drama of this film as well as the swordplay. The drama is incredibly well set up, most people glorify immortality when Connor lost Heather, the woman he loved. The swordplay/action has to be spoken for. They are incredibly well choreographed, It should come as no surprise that the guy that made those fight scenes possible was the same guy that choreographed the fight scenes in Star Wars, the recent Zorro attempts and Pirates Of The Caribbean. Bob Anderson was a fantastic fencer, I know because I've been learning fencing for nearly 7 years. I call this one of the best films of the 1980's. I hope you enjoy it. Before I go I recommend the movie Highlander: The Search For Vengeance It is by far the best continuation of this series that it has ever had. I haven't seen the TV show though. I'm just throwing it out there.

    Highlander to me represents everything that is wrong with movies - cheesy acting, poor fight choreography, a share of pointless characters and motives, a lot of plot holes and really odd directional choices - yet for some reason I watch it every couple of weeks. Without spoiling it, the movie deals with a group of people who are deemed "immortal" and thus cannot die unless they are killed by another immortal. The last immortal standing wins the mysterious "prize" and I'll say no more than that, but be prepared for a lot of sword fighting, the immortals weapon of choice, simply because they can only be killed by loosing their heads - literally! There is something very charming in this film, and I can only really explain it in its pacing. This film has possibly some of the best editing and pacing in any movie. It sets up every scene well, we know who is doing what and why, it takes time to explain via flashbacks (poorly acted and shot flashbacks true!) all its concepts and meanings. At no point in the film are we ever confused as to what an "immortal" is, and it explains well concepts like "the quickening", granted these are incredibly stupid and bizarre concepts that are largely laughable, but the movie clearly isn't taking itself that seriously. One appeal of the movie is in itself its poor approach to acting. A lot has been said about how awful the acting is in this movie, yet for some reason I find it somewhat appropriate to the whole theme of the film. In some ways it adds laughable charm. The villain of the movie is delightfully over the top making him one of the films most appealing aspects. High art this is not, a well thought-out and developed, albeit it crappy story can always provide me with entrainment. I always recommend this movie simply because, to me at least, its a perfect example of a movie that has a silly idea, but sticks to its guns and delivers it so well. At no point does the movie ever cut its losses and even attempt to return to something conventional - and for that I have to give it credit!

    Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is banished from his Scottish village in the 16th century after surviving a fatal injury (and thus believed to be in league with the devil). He meets Ramirez (Sean Connery), who reveals they are both Immortals; he becomes a mentor for Connor, even teaching him swordsmanship. In the present day, all Immortals are drawn together and have to fight until only one is left... This very creative and entertaining 80's fantasy/adventure was created by Gregory Widen, who would later also make another excellent fantasy 'The Prophecy'. An excellent and creative mind he is, a pity he doesn't make many films or screenplays. The director, Russell Mulcahy, is a former music video director; as such, the action scenes are frantic and the film is quite fast-paced. Surprisingly, this is not a negative point here. 'Highlander' feels, in many ways, as two separate films: there is the modern storyline, and the past 'flashbacks' where most of the story aspects are detailed. The quality varies a lot between them, too. The past is the best part. The scenes are livelier, being actually shot in the Scottish Highlands; there is a substantial amount of character development and, despite Lambert's limited acting ability, Connor truly starts growing on the viewer. Furthermore, Sean Connery lends much charm and wit as the Immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez (who is Egyptian but acts like a Spaniard). It is in this part that Widen's ingenuity is at its best; even the special effects, while very dated even at the time, end up being somewhat charming. 9/10 On the other hand, the modern parts take place in New York. They are often nighttime scenes, with a gloomy and dark mood that reminds more of a dystopian reality than the run-down parts of New York. The action sequences are good, but the special effects this time around end up being a negative point; furthermore, a weak supporting cast (which includes Roxanne Hart and Alan North), as well as the Immortal villain played by Clancy Brown (whose better moments are fighting Connery in the past scenes) hinders this portion of the story. 5/10 The final fight and conclusion are decent, though, and appropriately concludes the story (tying together major plot points, while leaving enough questions to light the viewer's imagination). In both 'stories', there is a fun and often witty dialogue. Also an excellent soundtrack by Queen which includes 'A Kind of Magic' and the 'Highlander's trademark 'Who Wants to Live Forever'. This is one film that, even if not remembered as a masterpiece, will always remain a classic. 'There can only be one!' Why couldn't the producers follow the Immortals' advice, and stray from making the awful sequels that only ended up staining the original's reputation?

    After many years I watched again Highlander. I didn't remember much of it, except that the last time I saw it I came away with a so-so kind of impression. Well, this time it was worse. The movie, or I, didn't age well. Probably both. Obviously, it's an action flick, so the plot is paper thin, something to do with immortals trying to chop each other's heads off for reasons the writers had the good grace to mostly leave in the dark, and at some point the central conflict gets a little more personal anyway. The plot isn't the problem, by the standards of the genre it's as good as any. And, of course, being made in the 80ies there is only so much one can expect in terms of technical perfection. The fight scenes are a bit tedious, and the special effects funny, but that, too, isn't really the problem. One problem is that the acting is uniformly bad. In fact, it's been a while since I saw a cast that failed at their jobs in almost perfect harmony. To be fair, the script doesn't provide a awful lot of opportunity for great acting, but all major actors even fail at the most basic emotions, much less the few instances where some complexity might have been nice. In part that is also the fault of script, direction, and photography; a good example is a very emotional moment between our hero and his wife, which is filled with stilted monologue, quick glances at Lambert's expressionless face, and then sweeping landscape shots to illustrate the enormity of the emotion that the actor didn't. The story itself is confused, and the characters are difficult to care for, and cartoonish. A few immortals pop into (and often quickly out of, in ways that make a mockery of the concept of "immortal") the storyline, but we never really learn much about them (with the exception of a little bit of background on Connery's character). The modern love story is contrived and ludicrous, and as much just a pretext for a little bit of mild nudity and humping as the rest is for the fight scenes. It's a carelessly strung together collection of stuff that is best not taken too seriously. Another small annoyance is the music --- good pieces by Queen, but as a soundtrack to a movie too intrusive. I guess it might still work for fans, but I doubt a modern viewer will get much pleasure from this movie. The premise is good enough for an action flick, but the execution just isn't very good.

    What a terrible film. It's interesting that the sequels have a reputation for lowering the standards of the series because this one is just as bad. The ropey plot, excruciating dialogue and terrible acting are outdone only by the atrocious animation effects - the finale looks as though someone accidentally spilled paint all over the negative. The almost demented incoherence with which this film has been flung together can be summed up by the fact that Christopher Lambert plays a Scot and Sean Connery plays a frickin' Spaniard! Who the hell cast this film? The only positives on display here are Russell Mulcahy's flashy direction and the inventive transitions between the flashbacks and the present day. There's nothing else on offer to keep you awake, and even the Queen songs are lousy.

    A Frenchman who is a Scots. A Scotsman who is Portuguese, songs by Queen, welcome to the world of Highlander. The film opens in New York and you soon go from a wrestling match to a sword fight. Via flashbacks we find out about Connor Macleod, how he has gone through the centuries making friends with immortals and fighting other immortals who are less than friendly in their search for the ultimate prize. As long as they do not lose their head, hence why they carry swords and try to decapitate each other in order to steal their power. We see Christopher Lambert falling in love, train with Sean Connery who explains to him, who he really is, duel with French aristocrats, fight Nazis and now in New York fight maybe the last remaining enemy, the evil Kurgen. The film was largely shot in the UK, at the time part of the film was like an extended pop promo, then again director Russell Mulcahy was better known for pop videos. The film was not a box office success but gained an audience on video. The film had a mix of a novel story, humour, violence, romance, songs, MTV style editing and rapidly gained a cult following. It is a classic.

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction. The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach. He has a tendency to use low shots, tracking shots and there was plenty of smoke and fog effects. New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites. When we see the battle in the Highlands looked very much like a music video, particularly with the Krugan dressed in a skull. The transitions to the flashbacks are done with tricks like pans, such as from a fish tank to a loch and the screen smashing like glass to go back to World War II. For an action film, Highlander is disappointing. The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands. When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Now first of all lets get the whole 'sequels' business out of the way. They're atrocious, boring, make no sense and were clearly spawned out of the imagination of over exuberant bankers! Now, for this amazing piece of work. Its brilliant. In every way, shape and form. The camera work is superb (and ahead of its time), the locations are excellently picked, the casting truly genius and the soundtrack and score truly fantastic (i may run out of superlatives by the end of this). *contains spoilers* The plot is unique given its part of the fantasy genre. Immortals born from no one knows or how (its never explained in the film), but yet none of this matters. They are invincible save for decapitation. They are drawn to one another till only one remains and this one immortal will gain 'the prize' infinite power and knowledge. Many have cast aspersions over the casting of Sean Connery as a Spanish/Egyptian who mentors our hero Christopher Lambert. But its superb, Connery is, as always, brilliant. Lambert is perfect as the Highlander from 'lots of different places'. But the real soup stealer is Clancy Brown as the Kurgen - he's the epitome of bad guy, knows he's powerful and takes full advantage,with no cage to bind him. The Queen soundtrack is incredible! Every song completes its scene. This is one of the best films ever made and certainly one of the best from the eighties. Yes its cheesy, yes its a bit camp, but boy does it do what films are supposed to do and really entertain!!

    What a terrible film. It's interesting that the sequels have a reputation for lowering the standards of the series because this one is just as bad. The ropey plot, excruciating dialogue and terrible acting are outdone only by the atrocious animation effects - the finale looks as though someone accidentally spilled paint all over the negative. The almost demented incoherence with which this film has been flung together can be summed up by the fact that Christopher Lambert plays a Scot and Sean Connery plays a frickin' Spaniard! Who the hell cast this film? The only positives on display here are Russell Mulcahy's flashy direction and the inventive transitions between the flashbacks and the present day. There's nothing else on offer to keep you awake, and even the Queen songs are lousy.

    A Frenchman who is a Scots. A Scotsman who is Portuguese, songs by Queen, welcome to the world of Highlander. The film opens in New York and you soon go from a wrestling match to a sword fight. Via flashbacks we find out about Connor Macleod, how he has gone through the centuries making friends with immortals and fighting other immortals who are less than friendly in their search for the ultimate prize. As long as they do not lose their head, hence why they carry swords and try to decapitate each other in order to steal their power. We see Christopher Lambert falling in love, train with Sean Connery who explains to him, who he really is, duel with French aristocrats, fight Nazis and now in New York fight maybe the last remaining enemy, the evil Kurgen. The film was largely shot in the UK, at the time part of the film was like an extended pop promo, then again director Russell Mulcahy was better known for pop videos. The film was not a box office success but gained an audience on video. The film had a mix of a novel story, humour, violence, romance, songs, MTV style editing and rapidly gained a cult following. It is a classic.

    Highlander is a cult classic from the 1980s with many fans and for better and for worst spawned a franchise. It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped. Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize. Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction. The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach. He has a tendency to use low shots, tracking shots and there was plenty of smoke and fog effects. New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites. When we see the battle in the Highlands looked very much like a music video, particularly with the Krugan dressed in a skull. The transitions to the flashbacks are done with tricks like pans, such as from a fish tank to a loch and the screen smashing like glass to go back to World War II. For an action film, Highlander is disappointing. The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands. When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath. Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene. The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners. Highlander is by no means a bad film, but it is not an almighty classic either and it has not stood the test of time like The Terminator has.

    Now first of all lets get the whole 'sequels' business out of the way. They're atrocious, boring, make no sense and were clearly spawned out of the imagination of over exuberant bankers! Now, for this amazing piece of work. Its brilliant. In every way, shape and form. The camera work is superb (and ahead of its time), the locations are excellently picked, the casting truly genius and the soundtrack and score truly fantastic (i may run out of superlatives by the end of this). *contains spoilers* The plot is unique given its part of the fantasy genre. Immortals born from no one knows or how (its never explained in the film), but yet none of this matters. They are invincible save for decapitation. They are drawn to one another till only one remains and this one immortal will gain 'the prize' infinite power and knowledge. Many have cast aspersions over the casting of Sean Connery as a Spanish/Egyptian who mentors our hero Christopher Lambert. But its superb, Connery is, as always, brilliant. Lambert is perfect as the Highlander from 'lots of different places'. But the real soup stealer is Clancy Brown as the Kurgen - he's the epitome of bad guy, knows he's powerful and takes full advantage,with no cage to bind him. The Queen soundtrack is incredible! Every song completes its scene. This is one of the best films ever made and certainly one of the best from the eighties. Yes its cheesy, yes its a bit camp, but boy does it do what films are supposed to do and really entertain!!

    Connor Macleod was born in 1518. After facing an evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, Macleod meets Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches him truth. He is immortal, and when one immortal takes the head of another, the loser's power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches Macleod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is killed by Connor's ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize, a signed copy of the soundtrack by Queen...... This has to be one of the strangest franchises of all time, and to be fair, the first movie really isn't the best thing, but what makes the franchise so popular is the notorious second entry, which is bad, but entertaining none the less. This is a good story, and a really good narrative, but Lambert is a really boring screen presence, spending the majority of the film staring into space with his boss eyes, while people like Connery, Brown and Imrie act him off the screen. If they had cast someone like Bridges, or even Liam Neeson, this could have been something special, rather than something that relies on a bad sequel to garner interest. All in all, its a great story, with some reasonable set pieces, but Lambert ruins it.

    I went in to this movie with low expectations,thinking it was going to be a bland adventure flick like "Conan:The Destroyer" or "Season of the witch".I was surprised to find out that "Highlander" is a very well made film.The idea is innovative,the story sucks you in very quickly and the acting is pretty good too.The film transitions between the modern time and the middle ages as it unfolds the history of our protagonist and the immortals as a whole.Plus there is a fantastic soundtrack to go along the way.The thing that kinda ruined the film for me were some of the unnecessarily long and over-the-top fight scenes,that served as an excuse to show off some fancy special effects,however,I admit,they were impressive for the time.I strongly recommend "Highlander",even to those who aren't adventure movie fans.

    I have seen this movie a few times, I still don't know why I don't see it more often? This isn't a bad movie by any stretch - it only got the reputation of being bad from the sequels(What sequels? Thats my attitude). I like the drama of this film as well as the swordplay. The drama is incredibly well set up, most people glorify immortality when Connor lost Heather, the woman he loved. The swordplay/action has to be spoken for. They are incredibly well choreographed, It should come as no surprise that the guy that made those fight scenes possible was the same guy that choreographed the fight scenes in Star Wars, the recent Zorro attempts and Pirates Of The Caribbean. Bob Anderson was a fantastic fencer, I know because I've been learning fencing for nearly 7 years. I call this one of the best films of the 1980's. I hope you enjoy it. Before I go I recommend the movie Highlander: The Search For Vengeance It is by far the best continuation of this series that it has ever had. I haven't seen the TV show though. I'm just throwing it out there.
