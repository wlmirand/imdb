    This movie was, well, a little nutty. It was fairly funny and erratic but overall good. It was mostly a hodgepodge of nutty characters (a transvestite, a psychotic santa, a suicide hotline staff, a very pregnant lady, your typical Adam Sandler character, etc.) and a bunch of strange situations. (a lady gets trapped in an elevator, they are about to shut down the hotline and evict them, the santa keeps tripping over a Christmas tree, Steve Martin dances with the transvestite, etc.) The movie mostly takes place on Christmas eve at a crisis hotline. It reminded me a little bit of Noises Off. If you have time to kill and enjoy a decent comedy-this is the movie for you! ** out of ****

    Mixed Nuts reads like it should be a huge home-run. I think most people would agree it is pretty hard to make a bad Christmas movie. As long as you put all the pieces in place and make people feel good and display some sort of "magic of Christmas" concept, you're pretty much golden. Then factor in the Ephron sisters having written this adaptation, Nora Ephron directing and an ensemble casts of various comedians and Hollywood talent all led by the amazing Steve Martin. It reads like a zany madcap holiday adventure not unlike National Lampoon's classic Christmas vacation. The problem is that this is where it all falls apart. It is simply missing something, an x-factor that leaves you feeling unfulfilled and really not having as much fun as you should be having. I think part of the problem is that it simply tries too hard. There is so much going on and it tries to incorporate all of these loud boisterous characters that you get overwhelmed. It perhaps feels more, at times, like a TV pilot to a crazy sitcom than a holiday movie. I love Steve Martin, especially his early work. He is a legendary comedian for a reason. He tries very hard to lead this cast and he does well playing the no-nonsense and almost uppity leader of the hot-line. He even gets a chance, albeit in very small doses, to show off that legendary physical comedy that I love. But he doesn't really get to shine and somehow seems stuck. Madeline Kahn is good but very stereotypical as the shrill and very uppity Mrs. Munchnik. I enjoy her but she doesn't really get a lot of character development to make her character go anywhere. Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia are lovers stuck in a perpetual battle against each other. Their banter is good and I think I would have preferred to watch more of them than everyone else. Both are very good in their roles. Liev Schreiber probably steals the show as cross-dresser Chris. He is the one character that really stands out and has some great scenes and is such a quirky and fun character that you can't help but like him. Rita Wilson is Catherine, a dreamer who is in love with Steve Martin's character. Wilson is fun and has some great charisma on screen and her and Martin are good together but like Martin, her character is left unexplored and without enough depth. You will spot a lot of very familiar faces in the supporting cast including a young Adam Sandler being the same Adam Sandler he has always been, complete with that stupid voice that has never been funny. Rob Reiner in a small cameo role that doesn't really stand out but he's always fun to see and Robert Klein in an even smaller cameo role. I think Mixed Nuts just simply has way too much going on. I think the Ephron sisters were a little ambitious and tried to cram too many ideas into one small story. They could have focused more closely on the key characters and maybe cut out some of the more chaotic scenes and Mixed Nuts would have felt more balanced. I mean, Nora Ephron knows comedy and romance and even drama and they just felt like a half hearted attempt all around. It wasn't completely un-enjoyable. It did have its moments and has some genuinely fun scenes but I honestly didn't even find myself laughing at much of it and this is the type of movie that should have you in stitches. Its just an okay entry in the holiday movie genre and with such a crowded genre with so many classic favourites...you have to be better than just okay. 6/10

    This may be the worse Christmas movie ever made. Plot was really bad, so the brilliant cast had no where to go but up, but really couldn't overcome the story. It is really amazing that according to IMDb the budget of $15M was spent on this rather than helping the homeless. Steve Martin is a name draw that you would expect to have at least a passable script to accept. Jon Stewart of the Daily Show is in this along with Parker Posey, but they have bit roles and I assume it was before either of them were known. We have a pile of Christmas movies that we reserve every year for getting together with family, and hoped that maybe this would be an addition to that. I think the verdict is clear, forget it.

    There isn't really much to this by way of story. It's Christmas Eve, and what story there is revolves around the crazy goings on at a suicide hotline centre run by Philip (Steve Martin) and staffed by Catherine (Rita Wilson) and Mrs. Munchnick (Madeine Kahn). Once you throw in Catherine's friends Gracie and Felix (Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia), an irritating neighbour (Adam Sandler) a depressed transvestite (Liev Schreiber), the landlord who's about to throw them all out (Garry Shandling) and a veterinarian who seems to spend most of his time treating people (Rob Reiner) along with a subplot (and can you really even have a "sub" plot when there's no real "plot" to speak of?) about a serial killer on the loose you know what you're going to get - a pretty silly movie. There are some scenes in this that are very funny. Schreiber's role did make me laugh a couple of times and the scenes between Martin and Wilson were generally pretty good. Sandler did what Sandler usually does for me - which is irritate me. Aside from those few scenes that made me laugh, though, this isn't outrageously funny. It's not a bad movie to waste some time with, but it's not something you're going to remember for very long. (6/10)

    This movie holds up really really well to repeated viewing. We have watched it every Christmas Eve for about 10 years and the whole family knows most of it by heart. It's funnier every time. With its large cast of wacky characters who make the story unfold like a pinball game, it has a lot in common with "You Can't Take It With You", another family favorite. I simply can't understand why it is so little known: it's a classic screwball comedy, with hilarious ensemble work by some of our greatest comic actors. Madeline Kahn's performance alone should put "Mixed Nuts" in every comedy lover's DVD library, since her untimely death so cruelly limited her wonderful body of work. She's at her absolute best here. Some of the actors were at a relatively early stage in their careers when this was made, and it is a testament to the judgment of the casting director that they were chosen."Mixed Nuts" introduced our family to Liev Schreiber, who plays a gloriously funny role that, taken with the work he's better known for, illustrates marvelous range. It's surprising to me that, as a big fan of snowy, wintry Christmases, my favorite Christmas movie is set in sunny L.A. But that is part of its charm: it is a story that gets its power from the interplay of innocence and irony. And the winner is: the audience.

    I have a collection of Christmas movies that I watch between Thanksgiving and Christmas. "Mixed Nuts" has been in the rotation since the day I bought it. Madeline Kahn was a genius. Liev Schrieber cracked me up. Rita Wilson was adorable and Steve Martin is, well, Steve Martin. I understand that many folks didn't like this movie and that's OK. Not every movie needs to get 10 stars. Many reviewers say that the movie is too over the top. My answer is "So?". Shall I break out a Marx Brothers movie for you? Over the top made them very famous. So, if this isn't for you, I understand. However, for me and my family, this is a Christmas classic along with "The Ref" and "Scrooged" among a couple dozen more traditional films.

    After seeing this movie, I consulted the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to hear of a "superior" 1982 French version. The surprise was short-lived. It is not better. There are interesting points of contrast: the French have more artistic cinematography, better gastronomy, and less formulaic denouement. A particular shot of the leading man lying on a couch with clothes and upholstery perfectly synchronized was unquestionably tasteful. But the Americans deserve credit too. Kahn lends her character far more depth than her French colleague. She undergoes a moving transformation that is not evident in Pere Noel. Martin equals L'Hermitte's commendable effort. Wilson surpasses her predecessor in both charm and feeling; she's more deserving of our sympathy. Sandler is funnier and far less nauseating than his French counterpart. And the real surprise is Lewis. Her rendition of the crazed pregnant lady is far more dignified than the Frenchwoman's, who was as unlikable as Lewis in her earlier turn as a Griswald in Christmas Vacation. But the real fork in the road is the conclusion. Whereas the French plunge into macabre darkness, the Americans end on several high notes. A Christmas movie must be jovial, and this version leaves me feeling better. Sometimes, even the worst catastrophes and deepest despair are followed immediately by pure jubilation.

    This is possibly Steve Martin's worst film. From the bad dye job (WHY?) to the bad acting to the bad writing to the poor direction to the crappy sets to the cheap costumes to the unfunny gags to the unsuccessful attempts at physical comedy to the sheer waste of great talent to the incredible, unbelievable, mind-blowing amount of sheer BOREDOM contained within, Mixed Nuts has it all. The jokes fall flat, the music is embarrassing and cartoonish, the characters are uninteresting...ugh, I'm bored even writing this review. I am stunned by how bad this was. It's nearly impossible to believe that the brains behind When Harry Met Sally directed this total failure of a movie. That was 90 minutes I will never get back.

    I can understand the negative reviews by those who compare it to the original film (which I haven't seen), but some of the other reviews are just ridiculous. This is a truly charming film with some singularly quirky and entertaining performances, as well as more cameos than you can shake a stick at. And yeah, it's a dark film set during the holidays - a time when suicides go up, so what's more appropriate than a comedy featuring a suicide hotline? Yeah, the movie is a bit slow and even a bit of a downer at times, but that's non profit work for you. It does eventually arrives at a happy ending, but it earns it. This is EASILY Adam Sandler's best film - he's funny, goofy and charming - and Madeline Kahn is hilarious in this as well. I love grape jelly!

    I hate to say it, but this is a Steve Martin superdud. I saw it in the theater amidst a sparse crowd, none of whom was laughing either. I've seen it in video stores since then, Steve Martin all over the cover. That makes sense because he's the only possible selling point; nobody you know is likely to recommend you watch it. Come to think of it, that's why I went to see it. I like most of Martin's stuff. The first few minutes (poking fun at SoCal Christmas) was the funniest part of the film...mildly funny. From there it just got worse -- incoherent, disjointed, at times just disturbing. It's one of the few movies I walked out of halfway through. Go ahead and watch this flick if: You've seen every other movie ever made and need to complete your record. You like Steve Martin so much that can't recognize when one of his movies sucks. Uhh...I can't think of another reason.

Go ahead and watch this flick if: You've seen every other movie ever made and need to complete your record. You like Steve Martin so much that can't recognize when one of his movies sucks. Uhh...I can't think of another reason.

    This movie was, well, a little nutty. It was fairly funny and erratic but overall good. It was mostly a hodgepodge of nutty characters (a transvestite, a psychotic santa, a suicide hotline staff, a very pregnant lady, your typical Adam Sandler character, etc.) and a bunch of strange situations. (a lady gets trapped in an elevator, they are about to shut down the hotline and evict them, the santa keeps tripping over a Christmas tree, Steve Martin dances with the transvestite, etc.) The movie mostly takes place on Christmas eve at a crisis hotline. It reminded me a little bit of Noises Off. If you have time to kill and enjoy a decent comedy-this is the movie for you! ** out of ****

    Mixed Nuts reads like it should be a huge home-run. I think most people would agree it is pretty hard to make a bad Christmas movie. As long as you put all the pieces in place and make people feel good and display some sort of "magic of Christmas" concept, you're pretty much golden. Then factor in the Ephron sisters having written this adaptation, Nora Ephron directing and an ensemble casts of various comedians and Hollywood talent all led by the amazing Steve Martin. It reads like a zany madcap holiday adventure not unlike National Lampoon's classic Christmas vacation. The problem is that this is where it all falls apart. It is simply missing something, an x-factor that leaves you feeling unfulfilled and really not having as much fun as you should be having. I think part of the problem is that it simply tries too hard. There is so much going on and it tries to incorporate all of these loud boisterous characters that you get overwhelmed. It perhaps feels more, at times, like a TV pilot to a crazy sitcom than a holiday movie. I love Steve Martin, especially his early work. He is a legendary comedian for a reason. He tries very hard to lead this cast and he does well playing the no-nonsense and almost uppity leader of the hot-line. He even gets a chance, albeit in very small doses, to show off that legendary physical comedy that I love. But he doesn't really get to shine and somehow seems stuck. Madeline Kahn is good but very stereotypical as the shrill and very uppity Mrs. Munchnik. I enjoy her but she doesn't really get a lot of character development to make her character go anywhere. Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia are lovers stuck in a perpetual battle against each other. Their banter is good and I think I would have preferred to watch more of them than everyone else. Both are very good in their roles. Liev Schreiber probably steals the show as cross-dresser Chris. He is the one character that really stands out and has some great scenes and is such a quirky and fun character that you can't help but like him. Rita Wilson is Catherine, a dreamer who is in love with Steve Martin's character. Wilson is fun and has some great charisma on screen and her and Martin are good together but like Martin, her character is left unexplored and without enough depth. You will spot a lot of very familiar faces in the supporting cast including a young Adam Sandler being the same Adam Sandler he has always been, complete with that stupid voice that has never been funny. Rob Reiner in a small cameo role that doesn't really stand out but he's always fun to see and Robert Klein in an even smaller cameo role. I think Mixed Nuts just simply has way too much going on. I think the Ephron sisters were a little ambitious and tried to cram too many ideas into one small story. They could have focused more closely on the key characters and maybe cut out some of the more chaotic scenes and Mixed Nuts would have felt more balanced. I mean, Nora Ephron knows comedy and romance and even drama and they just felt like a half hearted attempt all around. It wasn't completely un-enjoyable. It did have its moments and has some genuinely fun scenes but I honestly didn't even find myself laughing at much of it and this is the type of movie that should have you in stitches. Its just an okay entry in the holiday movie genre and with such a crowded genre with so many classic favourites...you have to be better than just okay. 6/10

    This may be the worse Christmas movie ever made. Plot was really bad, so the brilliant cast had no where to go but up, but really couldn't overcome the story. It is really amazing that according to IMDb the budget of $15M was spent on this rather than helping the homeless. Steve Martin is a name draw that you would expect to have at least a passable script to accept. Jon Stewart of the Daily Show is in this along with Parker Posey, but they have bit roles and I assume it was before either of them were known. We have a pile of Christmas movies that we reserve every year for getting together with family, and hoped that maybe this would be an addition to that. I think the verdict is clear, forget it.

    There isn't really much to this by way of story. It's Christmas Eve, and what story there is revolves around the crazy goings on at a suicide hotline centre run by Philip (Steve Martin) and staffed by Catherine (Rita Wilson) and Mrs. Munchnick (Madeine Kahn). Once you throw in Catherine's friends Gracie and Felix (Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia), an irritating neighbour (Adam Sandler) a depressed transvestite (Liev Schreiber), the landlord who's about to throw them all out (Garry Shandling) and a veterinarian who seems to spend most of his time treating people (Rob Reiner) along with a subplot (and can you really even have a "sub" plot when there's no real "plot" to speak of?) about a serial killer on the loose you know what you're going to get - a pretty silly movie. There are some scenes in this that are very funny. Schreiber's role did make me laugh a couple of times and the scenes between Martin and Wilson were generally pretty good. Sandler did what Sandler usually does for me - which is irritate me. Aside from those few scenes that made me laugh, though, this isn't outrageously funny. It's not a bad movie to waste some time with, but it's not something you're going to remember for very long. (6/10)

    This movie holds up really really well to repeated viewing. We have watched it every Christmas Eve for about 10 years and the whole family knows most of it by heart. It's funnier every time. With its large cast of wacky characters who make the story unfold like a pinball game, it has a lot in common with "You Can't Take It With You", another family favorite. I simply can't understand why it is so little known: it's a classic screwball comedy, with hilarious ensemble work by some of our greatest comic actors. Madeline Kahn's performance alone should put "Mixed Nuts" in every comedy lover's DVD library, since her untimely death so cruelly limited her wonderful body of work. She's at her absolute best here. Some of the actors were at a relatively early stage in their careers when this was made, and it is a testament to the judgment of the casting director that they were chosen."Mixed Nuts" introduced our family to Liev Schreiber, who plays a gloriously funny role that, taken with the work he's better known for, illustrates marvelous range. It's surprising to me that, as a big fan of snowy, wintry Christmases, my favorite Christmas movie is set in sunny L.A. But that is part of its charm: it is a story that gets its power from the interplay of innocence and irony. And the winner is: the audience.

    I have a collection of Christmas movies that I watch between Thanksgiving and Christmas. "Mixed Nuts" has been in the rotation since the day I bought it. Madeline Kahn was a genius. Liev Schrieber cracked me up. Rita Wilson was adorable and Steve Martin is, well, Steve Martin. I understand that many folks didn't like this movie and that's OK. Not every movie needs to get 10 stars. Many reviewers say that the movie is too over the top. My answer is "So?". Shall I break out a Marx Brothers movie for you? Over the top made them very famous. So, if this isn't for you, I understand. However, for me and my family, this is a Christmas classic along with "The Ref" and "Scrooged" among a couple dozen more traditional films.

    After seeing this movie, I consulted the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to hear of a "superior" 1982 French version. The surprise was short-lived. It is not better. There are interesting points of contrast: the French have more artistic cinematography, better gastronomy, and less formulaic denouement. A particular shot of the leading man lying on a couch with clothes and upholstery perfectly synchronized was unquestionably tasteful. But the Americans deserve credit too. Kahn lends her character far more depth than her French colleague. She undergoes a moving transformation that is not evident in Pere Noel. Martin equals L'Hermitte's commendable effort. Wilson surpasses her predecessor in both charm and feeling; she's more deserving of our sympathy. Sandler is funnier and far less nauseating than his French counterpart. And the real surprise is Lewis. Her rendition of the crazed pregnant lady is far more dignified than the Frenchwoman's, who was as unlikable as Lewis in her earlier turn as a Griswald in Christmas Vacation. But the real fork in the road is the conclusion. Whereas the French plunge into macabre darkness, the Americans end on several high notes. A Christmas movie must be jovial, and this version leaves me feeling better. Sometimes, even the worst catastrophes and deepest despair are followed immediately by pure jubilation.

    This is possibly Steve Martin's worst film. From the bad dye job (WHY?) to the bad acting to the bad writing to the poor direction to the crappy sets to the cheap costumes to the unfunny gags to the unsuccessful attempts at physical comedy to the sheer waste of great talent to the incredible, unbelievable, mind-blowing amount of sheer BOREDOM contained within, Mixed Nuts has it all. The jokes fall flat, the music is embarrassing and cartoonish, the characters are uninteresting...ugh, I'm bored even writing this review. I am stunned by how bad this was. It's nearly impossible to believe that the brains behind When Harry Met Sally directed this total failure of a movie. That was 90 minutes I will never get back.

    I can understand the negative reviews by those who compare it to the original film (which I haven't seen), but some of the other reviews are just ridiculous. This is a truly charming film with some singularly quirky and entertaining performances, as well as more cameos than you can shake a stick at. And yeah, it's a dark film set during the holidays - a time when suicides go up, so what's more appropriate than a comedy featuring a suicide hotline? Yeah, the movie is a bit slow and even a bit of a downer at times, but that's non profit work for you. It does eventually arrives at a happy ending, but it earns it. This is EASILY Adam Sandler's best film - he's funny, goofy and charming - and Madeline Kahn is hilarious in this as well. I love grape jelly!

    I hate to say it, but this is a Steve Martin superdud. I saw it in the theater amidst a sparse crowd, none of whom was laughing either. I've seen it in video stores since then, Steve Martin all over the cover. That makes sense because he's the only possible selling point; nobody you know is likely to recommend you watch it. Come to think of it, that's why I went to see it. I like most of Martin's stuff. The first few minutes (poking fun at SoCal Christmas) was the funniest part of the film...mildly funny.

    Mixed Nuts reads like it should be a huge home-run. I think most people would agree it is pretty hard to make a bad Christmas movie. As long as you put all the pieces in place and make people feel good and display some sort of "magic of Christmas" concept, you're pretty much golden. Then factor in the Ephron sisters having written this adaptation, Nora Ephron directing and an ensemble casts of various comedians and Hollywood talent all led by the amazing Steve Martin. It reads like a zany madcap holiday adventure not unlike National Lampoon's classic Christmas vacation. The problem is that this is where it all falls apart. It is simply missing something, an x-factor that leaves you feeling unfulfilled and really not having as much fun as you should be having. I think part of the problem is that it simply tries too hard. There is so much going on and it tries to incorporate all of these loud boisterous characters that you get overwhelmed. It perhaps feels more, at times, like a TV pilot to a crazy sitcom than a holiday movie. I love Steve Martin, especially his early work. He is a legendary comedian for a reason. He tries very hard to lead this cast and he does well playing the no-nonsense and almost uppity leader of the hot-line. He even gets a chance, albeit in very small doses, to show off that legendary physical comedy that I love. But he doesn't really get to shine and somehow seems stuck. Madeline Kahn is good but very stereotypical as the shrill and very uppity Mrs. Munchnik. I enjoy her but she doesn't really get a lot of character development to make her character go anywhere. Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia are lovers stuck in a perpetual battle against each other. Their banter is good and I think I would have preferred to watch more of them than everyone else. Both are very good in their roles. Liev Schreiber probably steals the show as cross-dresser Chris. He is the one character that really stands out and has some great scenes and is such a quirky and fun character that you can't help but like him. Rita Wilson is Catherine, a dreamer who is in love with Steve Martin's character. Wilson is fun and has some great charisma on screen and her and Martin are good together but like Martin, her character is left unexplored and without enough depth. You will spot a lot of very familiar faces in the supporting cast including a young Adam Sandler being the same Adam Sandler he has always been, complete with that stupid voice that has never been funny. Rob Reiner in a small cameo role that doesn't really stand out but he's always fun to see and Robert Klein in an even smaller cameo role. I think Mixed Nuts just simply has way too much going on. I think the Ephron sisters were a little ambitious and tried to cram too many ideas into one small story. They could have focused more closely on the key characters and maybe cut out some of the more chaotic scenes and Mixed Nuts would have felt more balanced. I mean, Nora Ephron knows comedy and romance and even drama and they just felt like a half hearted attempt all around. It wasn't completely un-enjoyable. It did have its moments and has some genuinely fun scenes but I honestly didn't even find myself laughing at much of it and this is the type of movie that should have you in stitches. Its just an okay entry in the holiday movie genre and with such a crowded genre with so many classic favourites...you have to be better than just okay. 6/10

    This may be the worse Christmas movie ever made. Plot was really bad, so the brilliant cast had no where to go but up, but really couldn't overcome the story. It is really amazing that according to IMDb the budget of $15M was spent on this rather than helping the homeless. Steve Martin is a name draw that you would expect to have at least a passable script to accept. Jon Stewart of the Daily Show is in this along with Parker Posey, but they have bit roles and I assume it was before either of them were known. We have a pile of Christmas movies that we reserve every year for getting together with family, and hoped that maybe this would be an addition to that. I think the verdict is clear, forget it.

    There isn't really much to this by way of story. It's Christmas Eve, and what story there is revolves around the crazy goings on at a suicide hotline centre run by Philip (Steve Martin) and staffed by Catherine (Rita Wilson) and Mrs. Munchnick (Madeine Kahn). Once you throw in Catherine's friends Gracie and Felix (Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia), an irritating neighbour (Adam Sandler) a depressed transvestite (Liev Schreiber), the landlord who's about to throw them all out (Garry Shandling) and a veterinarian who seems to spend most of his time treating people (Rob Reiner) along with a subplot (and can you really even have a "sub" plot when there's no real "plot" to speak of?) about a serial killer on the loose you know what you're going to get - a pretty silly movie. There are some scenes in this that are very funny. Schreiber's role did make me laugh a couple of times and the scenes between Martin and Wilson were generally pretty good. Sandler did what Sandler usually does for me - which is irritate me. Aside from those few scenes that made me laugh, though, this isn't outrageously funny. It's not a bad movie to waste some time with, but it's not something you're going to remember for very long. (6/10)

    This movie holds up really really well to repeated viewing. We have watched it every Christmas Eve for about 10 years and the whole family knows most of it by heart. It's funnier every time. With its large cast of wacky characters who make the story unfold like a pinball game, it has a lot in common with "You Can't Take It With You", another family favorite. I simply can't understand why it is so little known: it's a classic screwball comedy, with hilarious ensemble work by some of our greatest comic actors. Madeline Kahn's performance alone should put "Mixed Nuts" in every comedy lover's DVD library, since her untimely death so cruelly limited her wonderful body of work. She's at her absolute best here. Some of the actors were at a relatively early stage in their careers when this was made, and it is a testament to the judgment of the casting director that they were chosen."Mixed Nuts" introduced our family to Liev Schreiber, who plays a gloriously funny role that, taken with the work he's better known for, illustrates marvelous range. It's surprising to me that, as a big fan of snowy, wintry Christmases, my favorite Christmas movie is set in sunny L.A. But that is part of its charm: it is a story that gets its power from the interplay of innocence and irony. And the winner is: the audience.

    I have a collection of Christmas movies that I watch between Thanksgiving and Christmas. "Mixed Nuts" has been in the rotation since the day I bought it. Madeline Kahn was a genius. Liev Schrieber cracked me up. Rita Wilson was adorable and Steve Martin is, well, Steve Martin. I understand that many folks didn't like this movie and that's OK. Not every movie needs to get 10 stars. Many reviewers say that the movie is too over the top. My answer is "So?". Shall I break out a Marx Brothers movie for you? Over the top made them very famous. So, if this isn't for you, I understand. However, for me and my family, this is a Christmas classic along with "The Ref" and "Scrooged" among a couple dozen more traditional films.

    After seeing this movie, I consulted the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to hear of a "superior" 1982 French version. The surprise was short-lived. It is not better. There are interesting points of contrast: the French have more artistic cinematography, better gastronomy, and less formulaic denouement. A particular shot of the leading man lying on a couch with clothes and upholstery perfectly synchronized was unquestionably tasteful. But the Americans deserve credit too. Kahn lends her character far more depth than her French colleague. She undergoes a moving transformation that is not evident in Pere Noel. Martin equals L'Hermitte's commendable effort. Wilson surpasses her predecessor in both charm and feeling; she's more deserving of our sympathy. Sandler is funnier and far less nauseating than his French counterpart. And the real surprise is Lewis. Her rendition of the crazed pregnant lady is far more dignified than the Frenchwoman's, who was as unlikable as Lewis in her earlier turn as a Griswald in Christmas Vacation. But the real fork in the road is the conclusion. Whereas the French plunge into macabre darkness, the Americans end on several high notes. A Christmas movie must be jovial, and this version leaves me feeling better. Sometimes, even the worst catastrophes and deepest despair are followed immediately by pure jubilation.

    This is possibly Steve Martin's worst film. From the bad dye job (WHY?) to the bad acting to the bad writing to the poor direction to the crappy sets to the cheap costumes to the unfunny gags to the unsuccessful attempts at physical comedy to the sheer waste of great talent to the incredible, unbelievable, mind-blowing amount of sheer BOREDOM contained within, Mixed Nuts has it all. The jokes fall flat, the music is embarrassing and cartoonish, the characters are uninteresting...ugh, I'm bored even writing this review. I am stunned by how bad this was. It's nearly impossible to believe that the brains behind When Harry Met Sally directed this total failure of a movie. That was 90 minutes I will never get back.

    I can understand the negative reviews by those who compare it to the original film (which I haven't seen), but some of the other reviews are just ridiculous. This is a truly charming film with some singularly quirky and entertaining performances, as well as more cameos than you can shake a stick at. And yeah, it's a dark film set during the holidays - a time when suicides go up, so what's more appropriate than a comedy featuring a suicide hotline? Yeah, the movie is a bit slow and even a bit of a downer at times, but that's non profit work for you. It does eventually arrives at a happy ending, but it earns it. This is EASILY Adam Sandler's best film - he's funny, goofy and charming - and Madeline Kahn is hilarious in this as well. I love grape jelly!

    I hate to say it, but this is a Steve Martin superdud. I saw it in the theater amidst a sparse crowd, none of whom was laughing either. I've seen it in video stores since then, Steve Martin all over the cover. That makes sense because he's the only possible selling point; nobody you know is likely to recommend you watch it. Come to think of it, that's why I went to see it. I like most of Martin's stuff. The first few minutes (poking fun at SoCal Christmas) was the funniest part of the film...mildly funny. From there it just got worse -- incoherent, disjointed, at times just disturbing. It's one of the few movies I walked out of halfway through. Go ahead and watch this flick if: You've seen every other movie ever made and need to complete your record. You like Steve Martin so much that can't recognize when one of his movies sucks. Uhh...I can't think of another reason.

    This movie was, well, a little nutty. It was fairly funny and erratic but overall good. It was mostly a hodgepodge of nutty characters (a transvestite, a psychotic santa, a suicide hotline staff, a very pregnant lady, your typical Adam Sandler character, etc.) and a bunch of strange situations. (a lady gets trapped in an elevator, they are about to shut down the hotline and evict them, the santa keeps tripping over a Christmas tree, Steve Martin dances with the transvestite, etc.) The movie mostly takes place on Christmas eve at a crisis hotline. It reminded me a little bit of Noises Off. If you have time to kill and enjoy a decent comedy-this is the movie for you! ** out of ****

Wilson is fun and has some great charisma on screen and her and Martin are good together but like Martin, her character is left unexplored and without enough depth. You will spot a lot of very familiar faces in the supporting cast including a young Adam Sandler being the same Adam Sandler he has always been, complete with that stupid voice that has never been funny. Rob Reiner in a small cameo role that doesn't really stand out but he's always fun to see and Robert Klein in an even smaller cameo role. I think Mixed Nuts just simply has way too much going on. I think the Ephron sisters were a little ambitious and tried to cram too many ideas into one small story. They could have focused more closely on the key characters and maybe cut out some of the more chaotic scenes and Mixed Nuts would have felt more balanced. I mean, Nora Ephron knows comedy and romance and even drama and they just felt like a half hearted attempt all around. It wasn't completely un-enjoyable. It did have its moments and has some genuinely fun scenes but I honestly didn't even find myself laughing at much of it and this is the type of movie that should have you in stitches. Its just an okay entry in the holiday movie genre and with such a crowded genre with so many classic favourites...you have to be better than just okay. 6/10

    This may be the worse Christmas movie ever made. Plot was really bad, so the brilliant cast had no where to go but up, but really couldn't overcome the story. It is really amazing that according to IMDb the budget of $15M was spent on this rather than helping the homeless. Steve Martin is a name draw that you would expect to have at least a passable script to accept. Jon Stewart of the Daily Show is in this along with Parker Posey, but they have bit roles and I assume it was before either of them were known. We have a pile of Christmas movies that we reserve every year for getting together with family, and hoped that maybe this would be an addition to that. I think the verdict is clear, forget it.

    There isn't really much to this by way of story. It's Christmas Eve, and what story there is revolves around the crazy goings on at a suicide hotline centre run by Philip (Steve Martin) and staffed by Catherine (Rita Wilson) and Mrs. Munchnick (Madeine Kahn). Once you throw in Catherine's friends Gracie and Felix (Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia), an irritating neighbour (Adam Sandler) a depressed transvestite (Liev Schreiber), the landlord who's about to throw them all out (Garry Shandling) and a veterinarian who seems to spend most of his time treating people (Rob Reiner) along with a subplot (and can you really even have a "sub" plot when there's no real "plot" to speak of?) about a serial killer on the loose you know what you're going to get - a pretty silly movie. There are some scenes in this that are very funny. Schreiber's role did make me laugh a couple of times and the scenes between Martin and Wilson were generally pretty good. Sandler did what Sandler usually does for me - which is irritate me. Aside from those few scenes that made me laugh, though, this isn't outrageously funny. It's not a bad movie to waste some time with, but it's not something you're going to remember for very long. (6/10)

    This movie holds up really really well to repeated viewing. We have watched it every Christmas Eve for about 10 years and the whole family knows most of it by heart. It's funnier every time. With its large cast of wacky characters who make the story unfold like a pinball game, it has a lot in common with "You Can't Take It With You", another family favorite. I simply can't understand why it is so little known: it's a classic screwball comedy, with hilarious ensemble work by some of our greatest comic actors. Madeline Kahn's performance alone should put "Mixed Nuts" in every comedy lover's DVD library, since her untimely death so cruelly limited her wonderful body of work. She's at her absolute best here. Some of the actors were at a relatively early stage in their careers when this was made, and it is a testament to the judgment of the casting director that they were chosen."Mixed Nuts" introduced our family to Liev Schreiber, who plays a gloriously funny role that, taken with the work he's better known for, illustrates marvelous range. It's surprising to me that, as a big fan of snowy, wintry Christmases, my favorite Christmas movie is set in sunny L.A. But that is part of its charm: it is a story that gets its power from the interplay of innocence and irony. And the winner is: the audience.

    I have a collection of Christmas movies that I watch between Thanksgiving and Christmas. "Mixed Nuts" has been in the rotation since the day I bought it. Madeline Kahn was a genius. Liev Schrieber cracked me up. Rita Wilson was adorable and Steve Martin is, well, Steve Martin. I understand that many folks didn't like this movie and that's OK. Not every movie needs to get 10 stars. Many reviewers say that the movie is too over the top. My answer is "So?". Shall I break out a Marx Brothers movie for you? Over the top made them very famous. So, if this isn't for you, I understand. However, for me and my family, this is a Christmas classic along with "The Ref" and "Scrooged" among a couple dozen more traditional films.

    After seeing this movie, I consulted the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to hear of a "superior" 1982 French version. The surprise was short-lived. It is not better. There are interesting points of contrast: the French have more artistic cinematography, better gastronomy, and less formulaic denouement. A particular shot of the leading man lying on a couch with clothes and upholstery perfectly synchronized was unquestionably tasteful. But the Americans deserve credit too. Kahn lends her character far more depth than her French colleague. She undergoes a moving transformation that is not evident in Pere Noel. Martin equals L'Hermitte's commendable effort. Wilson surpasses her predecessor in both charm and feeling; she's more deserving of our sympathy. Sandler is funnier and far less nauseating than his French counterpart. And the real surprise is Lewis. Her rendition of the crazed pregnant lady is far more dignified than the Frenchwoman's, who was as unlikable as Lewis in her earlier turn as a Griswald in Christmas Vacation. But the real fork in the road is the conclusion. Whereas the French plunge into macabre darkness, the Americans end on several high notes. A Christmas movie must be jovial, and this version leaves me feeling better. Sometimes, even the worst catastrophes and deepest despair are followed immediately by pure jubilation.

    This is possibly Steve Martin's worst film. From the bad dye job (WHY?) to the bad acting to the bad writing to the poor direction to the crappy sets to the cheap costumes to the unfunny gags to the unsuccessful attempts at physical comedy to the sheer waste of great talent to the incredible, unbelievable, mind-blowing amount of sheer BOREDOM contained within, Mixed Nuts has it all. The jokes fall flat, the music is embarrassing and cartoonish, the characters are uninteresting...ugh, I'm bored even writing this review. I am stunned by how bad this was. It's nearly impossible to believe that the brains behind When Harry Met Sally directed this total failure of a movie. That was 90 minutes I will never get back.

    I can understand the negative reviews by those who compare it to the original film (which I haven't seen), but some of the other reviews are just ridiculous. This is a truly charming film with some singularly quirky and entertaining performances, as well as more cameos than you can shake a stick at. And yeah, it's a dark film set during the holidays - a time when suicides go up, so what's more appropriate than a comedy featuring a suicide hotline? Yeah, the movie is a bit slow and even a bit of a downer at times, but that's non profit work for you. It does eventually arrives at a happy ending, but it earns it. This is EASILY Adam Sandler's best film - he's funny, goofy and charming - and Madeline Kahn is hilarious in this as well. I love grape jelly!

    I hate to say it, but this is a Steve Martin superdud. I saw it in the theater amidst a sparse crowd, none of whom was laughing either. I've seen it in video stores since then, Steve Martin all over the cover. That makes sense because he's the only possible selling point; nobody you know is likely to recommend you watch it. Come to think of it, that's why I went to see it. I like most of Martin's stuff. The first few minutes (poking fun at SoCal Christmas) was the funniest part of the film...mildly funny. From there it just got worse -- incoherent, disjointed, at times just disturbing. It's one of the few movies I walked out of halfway through. Go ahead and watch this flick if: You've seen every other movie ever made and need to complete your record. You like Steve Martin so much that can't recognize when one of his movies sucks. Uhh...I can't think of another reason.

    This movie was, well, a little nutty. It was fairly funny and erratic but overall good. It was mostly a hodgepodge of nutty characters (a transvestite, a psychotic santa, a suicide hotline staff, a very pregnant lady, your typical Adam Sandler character, etc.) and a bunch of strange situations. (a lady gets trapped in an elevator, they are about to shut down the hotline and evict them, the santa keeps tripping over a Christmas tree, Steve Martin dances with the transvestite, etc.) The movie mostly takes place on Christmas eve at a crisis hotline. It reminded me a little bit of Noises Off. If you have time to kill and enjoy a decent comedy-this is the movie for you! ** out of ****

    Mixed Nuts reads like it should be a huge home-run. I think most people would agree it is pretty hard to make a bad Christmas movie. As long as you put all the pieces in place and make people feel good and display some sort of "magic of Christmas" concept, you're pretty much golden. Then factor in the Ephron sisters having written this adaptation, Nora Ephron directing and an ensemble casts of various comedians and Hollywood talent all led by the amazing Steve Martin. It reads like a zany madcap holiday adventure not unlike National Lampoon's classic Christmas vacation. The problem is that this is where it all falls apart. It is simply missing something, an x-factor that leaves you feeling unfulfilled and really not having as much fun as you should be having. I think part of the problem is that it simply tries too hard. There is so much going on and it tries to incorporate all of these loud boisterous characters that you get overwhelmed. It perhaps feels more, at times, like a TV pilot to a crazy sitcom than a holiday movie. I love Steve Martin, especially his early work. He is a legendary comedian for a reason. He tries very hard to lead this cast and he does well playing the no-nonsense and almost uppity leader of the hot-line. He even gets a chance, albeit in very small doses, to show off that legendary physical comedy that I love. But he doesn't really get to shine and somehow seems stuck. Madeline Kahn is good but very stereotypical as the shrill and very uppity Mrs. Munchnik. I enjoy her but she doesn't really get a lot of character development to make her character go anywhere. Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia are lovers stuck in a perpetual battle against each other. Their banter is good and I think I would have preferred to watch more of them than everyone else. Both are very good in their roles. Liev Schreiber probably steals the show as cross-dresser Chris. He is the one character that really stands out and has some great scenes and is such a quirky and fun character that you can't help but like him. Rita Wilson is Catherine, a dreamer who is in love with Steve Martin's character.

Steve Martin is a name draw that you would expect to have at least a passable script to accept. Jon Stewart of the Daily Show is in this along with Parker Posey, but they have bit roles and I assume it was before either of them were known. We have a pile of Christmas movies that we reserve every year for getting together with family, and hoped that maybe this would be an addition to that. I think the verdict is clear, forget it.

    There isn't really much to this by way of story. It's Christmas Eve, and what story there is revolves around the crazy goings on at a suicide hotline centre run by Philip (Steve Martin) and staffed by Catherine (Rita Wilson) and Mrs. Munchnick (Madeine Kahn). Once you throw in Catherine's friends Gracie and Felix (Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia), an irritating neighbour (Adam Sandler) a depressed transvestite (Liev Schreiber), the landlord who's about to throw them all out (Garry Shandling) and a veterinarian who seems to spend most of his time treating people (Rob Reiner) along with a subplot (and can you really even have a "sub" plot when there's no real "plot" to speak of?) about a serial killer on the loose you know what you're going to get - a pretty silly movie. There are some scenes in this that are very funny. Schreiber's role did make me laugh a couple of times and the scenes between Martin and Wilson were generally pretty good. Sandler did what Sandler usually does for me - which is irritate me. Aside from those few scenes that made me laugh, though, this isn't outrageously funny. It's not a bad movie to waste some time with, but it's not something you're going to remember for very long. (6/10)

    This movie holds up really really well to repeated viewing. We have watched it every Christmas Eve for about 10 years and the whole family knows most of it by heart. It's funnier every time. With its large cast of wacky characters who make the story unfold like a pinball game, it has a lot in common with "You Can't Take It With You", another family favorite. I simply can't understand why it is so little known: it's a classic screwball comedy, with hilarious ensemble work by some of our greatest comic actors. Madeline Kahn's performance alone should put "Mixed Nuts" in every comedy lover's DVD library, since her untimely death so cruelly limited her wonderful body of work. She's at her absolute best here. Some of the actors were at a relatively early stage in their careers when this was made, and it is a testament to the judgment of the casting director that they were chosen."Mixed Nuts" introduced our family to Liev Schreiber, who plays a gloriously funny role that, taken with the work he's better known for, illustrates marvelous range. It's surprising to me that, as a big fan of snowy, wintry Christmases, my favorite Christmas movie is set in sunny L.A. But that is part of its charm: it is a story that gets its power from the interplay of innocence and irony. And the winner is: the audience.

    I have a collection of Christmas movies that I watch between Thanksgiving and Christmas. "Mixed Nuts" has been in the rotation since the day I bought it. Madeline Kahn was a genius. Liev Schrieber cracked me up. Rita Wilson was adorable and Steve Martin is, well, Steve Martin. I understand that many folks didn't like this movie and that's OK. Not every movie needs to get 10 stars. Many reviewers say that the movie is too over the top. My answer is "So?". Shall I break out a Marx Brothers movie for you? Over the top made them very famous. So, if this isn't for you, I understand. However, for me and my family, this is a Christmas classic along with "The Ref" and "Scrooged" among a couple dozen more traditional films.

    After seeing this movie, I consulted the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to hear of a "superior" 1982 French version. The surprise was short-lived. It is not better. There are interesting points of contrast: the French have more artistic cinematography, better gastronomy, and less formulaic denouement. A particular shot of the leading man lying on a couch with clothes and upholstery perfectly synchronized was unquestionably tasteful. But the Americans deserve credit too. Kahn lends her character far more depth than her French colleague. She undergoes a moving transformation that is not evident in Pere Noel. Martin equals L'Hermitte's commendable effort. Wilson surpasses her predecessor in both charm and feeling; she's more deserving of our sympathy. Sandler is funnier and far less nauseating than his French counterpart. And the real surprise is Lewis. Her rendition of the crazed pregnant lady is far more dignified than the Frenchwoman's, who was as unlikable as Lewis in her earlier turn as a Griswald in Christmas Vacation. But the real fork in the road is the conclusion. Whereas the French plunge into macabre darkness, the Americans end on several high notes. A Christmas movie must be jovial, and this version leaves me feeling better. Sometimes, even the worst catastrophes and deepest despair are followed immediately by pure jubilation.

    This is possibly Steve Martin's worst film. From the bad dye job (WHY?) to the bad acting to the bad writing to the poor direction to the crappy sets to the cheap costumes to the unfunny gags to the unsuccessful attempts at physical comedy to the sheer waste of great talent to the incredible, unbelievable, mind-blowing amount of sheer BOREDOM contained within, Mixed Nuts has it all. The jokes fall flat, the music is embarrassing and cartoonish, the characters are uninteresting...ugh, I'm bored even writing this review. I am stunned by how bad this was. It's nearly impossible to believe that the brains behind When Harry Met Sally directed this total failure of a movie. That was 90 minutes I will never get back.

    I can understand the negative reviews by those who compare it to the original film (which I haven't seen), but some of the other reviews are just ridiculous. This is a truly charming film with some singularly quirky and entertaining performances, as well as more cameos than you can shake a stick at. And yeah, it's a dark film set during the holidays - a time when suicides go up, so what's more appropriate than a comedy featuring a suicide hotline? Yeah, the movie is a bit slow and even a bit of a downer at times, but that's non profit work for you. It does eventually arrives at a happy ending, but it earns it. This is EASILY Adam Sandler's best film - he's funny, goofy and charming - and Madeline Kahn is hilarious in this as well. I love grape jelly!

    I hate to say it, but this is a Steve Martin superdud. I saw it in the theater amidst a sparse crowd, none of whom was laughing either. I've seen it in video stores since then, Steve Martin all over the cover. That makes sense because he's the only possible selling point; nobody you know is likely to recommend you watch it. Come to think of it, that's why I went to see it. I like most of Martin's stuff. The first few minutes (poking fun at SoCal Christmas) was the funniest part of the film...mildly funny. From there it just got worse -- incoherent, disjointed, at times just disturbing. It's one of the few movies I walked out of halfway through. Go ahead and watch this flick if: You've seen every other movie ever made and need to complete your record. You like Steve Martin so much that can't recognize when one of his movies sucks. Uhh...I can't think of another reason.

    This movie was, well, a little nutty. It was fairly funny and erratic but overall good. It was mostly a hodgepodge of nutty characters (a transvestite, a psychotic santa, a suicide hotline staff, a very pregnant lady, your typical Adam Sandler character, etc.) and a bunch of strange situations. (a lady gets trapped in an elevator, they are about to shut down the hotline and evict them, the santa keeps tripping over a Christmas tree, Steve Martin dances with the transvestite, etc.) The movie mostly takes place on Christmas eve at a crisis hotline. It reminded me a little bit of Noises Off. If you have time to kill and enjoy a decent comedy-this is the movie for you! ** out of ****

    Mixed Nuts reads like it should be a huge home-run. I think most people would agree it is pretty hard to make a bad Christmas movie. As long as you put all the pieces in place and make people feel good and display some sort of "magic of Christmas" concept, you're pretty much golden. Then factor in the Ephron sisters having written this adaptation, Nora Ephron directing and an ensemble casts of various comedians and Hollywood talent all led by the amazing Steve Martin. It reads like a zany madcap holiday adventure not unlike National Lampoon's classic Christmas vacation. The problem is that this is where it all falls apart. It is simply missing something, an x-factor that leaves you feeling unfulfilled and really not having as much fun as you should be having. I think part of the problem is that it simply tries too hard. There is so much going on and it tries to incorporate all of these loud boisterous characters that you get overwhelmed. It perhaps feels more, at times, like a TV pilot to a crazy sitcom than a holiday movie. I love Steve Martin, especially his early work. He is a legendary comedian for a reason. He tries very hard to lead this cast and he does well playing the no-nonsense and almost uppity leader of the hot-line. He even gets a chance, albeit in very small doses, to show off that legendary physical comedy that I love. But he doesn't really get to shine and somehow seems stuck. Madeline Kahn is good but very stereotypical as the shrill and very uppity Mrs. Munchnik. I enjoy her but she doesn't really get a lot of character development to make her character go anywhere. Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia are lovers stuck in a perpetual battle against each other. Their banter is good and I think I would have preferred to watch more of them than everyone else. Both are very good in their roles. Liev Schreiber probably steals the show as cross-dresser Chris. He is the one character that really stands out and has some great scenes and is such a quirky and fun character that you can't help but like him. Rita Wilson is Catherine, a dreamer who is in love with Steve Martin's character. Wilson is fun and has some great charisma on screen and her and Martin are good together but like Martin, her character is left unexplored and without enough depth. You will spot a lot of very familiar faces in the supporting cast including a young Adam Sandler being the same Adam Sandler he has always been, complete with that stupid voice that has never been funny. Rob Reiner in a small cameo role that doesn't really stand out but he's always fun to see and Robert Klein in an even smaller cameo role. I think Mixed Nuts just simply has way too much going on. I think the Ephron sisters were a little ambitious and tried to cram too many ideas into one small story. They could have focused more closely on the key characters and maybe cut out some of the more chaotic scenes and Mixed Nuts would have felt more balanced. I mean, Nora Ephron knows comedy and romance and even drama and they just felt like a half hearted attempt all around. It wasn't completely un-enjoyable. It did have its moments and has some genuinely fun scenes but I honestly didn't even find myself laughing at much of it and this is the type of movie that should have you in stitches. Its just an okay entry in the holiday movie genre and with such a crowded genre with so many classic favourites...you have to be better than just okay. 6/10
