    For the most part, I really liked this film (more on that later), so I was surprised to see it get such low ratings. In reading up on the film, I learned it was supposed to be based on the life of Jessica Savitch, a newscaster I remember quite well, although I forgot how she died. I have a feeling the producers/director were in a damned if we do, and damned if we don't situation here. They were inspired by Savitch's life story, but wanted to make a love story, instead. If they just told the love story, and weren't open about the Savitch angle, they'd be criticized. If they made it clear the story came from the Savitch bio, but didn't make it a documentary/fiction story, they'd be criticized as well. They should have just shut up about where the inspiration for the story came from. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Now, as to saying that I really liked this film, there is a huge "except" here. I see no reason in a romantic story like this to kill of one of the two major characters. Yes, I (and apparently most people) wanted a happy ending. I was disappointed to see Redford killed at the end...and I see no good reason that was the way it ended. The film just edged down a notch for me. But, perhaps the problem with the film is that when you begin watching it you think it's one thing -- a romance story with some humor...but then it turns deadly serious. Another thing that would have helped would have been some timelines, particularly in Tally's time in Miami. It was difficult to get a sense of how long it took her to go from desk work, to weather, to reporter, etc. The acting here is superb. Redford, who was pretty much always at the top of his game, was here, also. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent, as well. It's too bad she's not been in such wonderful roles in recent years. This is very much Redford's and Pfeiffer's film. Sure there are supporting actors, but none that have memorable roles, although their performances are all very good. It seems as if this film suffered from a bit of an identity confusion. But I still liked it...very much...except for the ending.

    I love Michelle Pfeiffer. Robert Redford is a superstar. Which is why I shelled out for a cinema ticket in 1996 while I was working in Canberra. The first clue should have been the turnout. There were 5 other people in the theatre. 2 left about halfway through. The recent movie that jogged my mind about Up Close and Personal was "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World". Steve Carell and Keira Knightly...how could you go wrong? At the end of that movie, and after I'd said "is that it?" I remembered 1996. 2 big stars of the moment, an interesting premise, but a total turkey. What the 2 movies had in common was a couple of actors walking through their lines with as much feeling and believability as the bored woman who sold me the tickets at the counter. Absolutely no chemistry, no connection with the audience; you could almost hear Pfeiffer and Redford thinking 'is this over yet?' Contrast this with Pfeiffer's other 1996 effort One Fine Day, and you see that her heart is still in it. Whereas Redford's efforts since this stinker have been mediocre at best. Up Close & Personal was so bad that it took nearly 17 years for Carell's non-effort to knock it off my Worst Movie mantle.

    It goes on, and on, and on, the same thread repeated ad nauseum: will he (Robert Redford) get her (Michelle Pfeiffer)? Does Santa's lady still darn socks? Mr Redford seems to have run out of gas. He's the one who mentors the pretty news girl, but where's their personal situation going,up or down? Before long, this viewer didn't care--their characters weren't strong enough to build or deserve any empathy with the audience. Ms Pfeiffer, as all know,rose to prominence as a model, and it has been her stronger suite; she reached modest heights as an actress, and now in her 50s, still has a very busy movie schedule. Mr Redford plays much the same role in each of his (fewer and fewer) movies, that of the movie actor Robert Redford. This viewer went from disinterested to bored and then sleep before exiting. It's the worst response you can give any film, save burning down the cinema or local DVD outlet.

    Technically this is a well done movie. The scenes are constructed well, the cinematography is excellent, the acting is fine. At the end of the day what one is left with is a LifeTime Movie Network movie. A pretty LMN film that is better than most of the material the network runs...but it is LMN fare. **SPOILER** The end says it all: Cat Woman is at an office farewell party. She is the glory of the party. Everyone hangs on her every word describing the events that have just been witnessed. The TV is turned on and the dramatic build of the death of Jeremiah Johnson occurs where at first Mrs. Montana is the only person to realize who's sole of who's shoe laying on the ground. The dramatic build is heightened by...by...a glass of champagne falling at hitting the ground!!!!! WOW!!!!!!! Then comes the obligatory shameless acting cry and wail. Can't you just feel the tears jerking out of the audience!!!! Play it as it Lays, Michelle, Play it hard. Play it like Susan Lucci! If you think that this is life you need to get one. If you like this soapy teary weepy waily incredibly constructed climax then this is a 10 max film for you.

    There is an advantage when the fare on television is so bland that the box of purchased DVDs comes out of the closet: some of those oldies are so good that they make the current crop of contemporary comedy/drama love stories inept. Such is the case in viewing the very popular 1996 film UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, a film whose nidus is Alanna Nash's expos&eacute; book 'Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch' adapted and remolded for the screen by no less than Joan Didion and John Gregroy Dunne, under the careful and tidy direction of Jon Avnet, and starring two of screen's most popular talents Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. The film suggests the Jessica Savitch story, the newswoman who, in the 1970's, became the "First Woman Anchor". Sally/Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is from the other side of the tracks in Reno who is obsessed with becoming a news star. She fakes her r&eacute;sum&eacute;, barges into an important television studio run by the indomitable Warren Justice, fakes is and fails as a weather forecaster, yet is so refreshingly purposeful that she is taken under the wing of Warren in a Miami newsroom, given not only a makeover in appearance, but also the chance to make a difference in a news story involving the sad plight of Cuban exiles swimming to freedom in Florida, and becomes a news star on TV. There is a chemistry between the two and despite Warren's tendency to marry and divorce frequently the two fall in love. Yet despite her love for Warren, she takes the big chance and moves on to Philadelphia, where he follows to rescue her faltering career at the cost of his own - as she rises he falls. It is a love story and more - a Pygmalion reshaping of a true tale. Both Redford and Pfeiffer look and act great and they are surrounded by a fine cast of extras - Stockard Channing, Kate Nelligan, Joe Mantegna, etc. Nice to remember when love stories were not just about potty mouth derring-do, but instead were well written and well crafted little films.

    I don't know how anyone could watch this movie and not love it. The line up of actors in the move are amazing and maybe that's why some people expected a different kind of movie. The movie moves a long perfectly, telling the story in a great time line. It doesn't drag and there is not one part of the story that doesn't fit. It's as if a friend is telling you the main highlights of a friends' love life. I gave it a ten - Redford an Pfieffer make a great, believable couple and you can tell they put their heart into this movie. They both play people who are intelligent and aren't afraid to fight for what they believe it, something we all strive for. Get a tissue, you'll need it.

    I find it ironic, that the movie recommendations given by IMDb for other movies "similar" to "Up Close and Personal" are NONE of the other versions of it. (A Star is Born, 1937, A Star is Born, 1954, A Star is Born, 1976. And... now I have to add something else, because my short comment, though to the point, is not long enough to leave as a comment. "Your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text." How do you figure out how much to say, when you have said enough? Should I make out my Christmas wish list? Or Maybe... I can make suggestions for new couples that can be hired to remake this re-make? mmmmm... George Clooney. Yeah... Thats good...

    As someone who works in the news business, I cringe, laugh and cry when I watch Up Close and Personal. It bears almost no resemblance except for a broad outline of what life in local and network TV news is all about. Broadcast News is a far more apt portrayal of the real pressures of a newsroom. And yet, Up Close and Personal is more fun to watch, especially on a rainy afternoon with a big bucket of popcorn and some Kleenex nearby. Robert Redford, Stockard Channing and Kate Nelligan give good performances while Joe Mantegna has one of the most delightful character names ever in a movie: Bucky Terranova. Michelle Pfeiffer is the weakest link and her prison scenes are ludicrous, but her Miami wardrobe and hair are stunning. She plays well off Robert Redford, who for once loses his wooden quality and actually seems to have some chemistry with her. It's hard to imagine that Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne actually wrote this movie, since it's such a potboiler and nothing like their finest work. But on the other hand, it proves that they really were romantics. I put this in the same category as "The Best of Everything" and "Designing Woman" (the original, starring Lauren Bacall.) You can't call them great movies, but they have charm of their own.

    Usually I like to research a movie for fun before watching it. I don't like to waste time watching a movie for 2 or 3 hours. What I learned is that this movie is based on "Jessica Savitch" who in the 1970s became the first female American anchor on television. The movie was based on the book " Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch" written by Alanna Nash. The movie is said not to be as accurate in detail and also over dramatize and exaggerate events. Also emphasizing on aspects that are debatable. So the movie might be leaning more towards fiction, then of true events. But that's debatable. I didn't give the movie a rating because after 20 minutes i couldn't bare to watch anymore. The movie had nothing to draw me in at all. Nothing to captivate me into sitting there and watching it for free. I suppose if you are the type that like to judge a movie after watching it then the best thing for you to do is watch the whole thing.

    ...the fact that the interaction between the characters at times is very stilted. A particular scene in which Warren Justice (Robert Redford) is telling Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) how to put a news story together is particularly telling. Their dialogue is an interaction that has a noticeable pause between each line, and it made me think that perhaps it had not been well directed. The scenes don't always seems a smooth continuance. The sub-story regarding the siege at Holbrook Prison was lengthy and took a large part of the movie. Whilst it portrayed Tally's growing talent and removal from Justice's Svengali-like influence, it, for me, broke the continuancy of the movie. But despite this, the movie really struck a chord with me. It is one of the few movies I bought on DVD that I watch repeatedly. For some enigmatic reason, I love the movie despite the obvious flaws.

A particular scene in which Warren Justice (Robert Redford) is telling Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) how to put a news story together is particularly telling. Their dialogue is an interaction that has a noticeable pause between each line, and it made me think that perhaps it had not been well directed. The scenes don't always seems a smooth continuance. The sub-story regarding the siege at Holbrook Prison was lengthy and took a large part of the movie. Whilst it portrayed Tally's growing talent and removal from Justice's Svengali-like influence, it, for me, broke the continuancy of the movie. But despite this, the movie really struck a chord with me. It is one of the few movies I bought on DVD that I watch repeatedly. For some enigmatic reason, I love the movie despite the obvious flaws.

    For the most part, I really liked this film (more on that later), so I was surprised to see it get such low ratings. In reading up on the film, I learned it was supposed to be based on the life of Jessica Savitch, a newscaster I remember quite well, although I forgot how she died. I have a feeling the producers/director were in a damned if we do, and damned if we don't situation here. They were inspired by Savitch's life story, but wanted to make a love story, instead. If they just told the love story, and weren't open about the Savitch angle, they'd be criticized. If they made it clear the story came from the Savitch bio, but didn't make it a documentary/fiction story, they'd be criticized as well. They should have just shut up about where the inspiration for the story came from. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Now, as to saying that I really liked this film, there is a huge "except" here. I see no reason in a romantic story like this to kill of one of the two major characters. Yes, I (and apparently most people) wanted a happy ending. I was disappointed to see Redford killed at the end...and I see no good reason that was the way it ended. The film just edged down a notch for me. But, perhaps the problem with the film is that when you begin watching it you think it's one thing -- a romance story with some humor...but then it turns deadly serious. Another thing that would have helped would have been some timelines, particularly in Tally's time in Miami. It was difficult to get a sense of how long it took her to go from desk work, to weather, to reporter, etc. The acting here is superb. Redford, who was pretty much always at the top of his game, was here, also. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent, as well. It's too bad she's not been in such wonderful roles in recent years. This is very much Redford's and Pfeiffer's film. Sure there are supporting actors, but none that have memorable roles, although their performances are all very good. It seems as if this film suffered from a bit of an identity confusion. But I still liked it...very much...except for the ending.

    I love Michelle Pfeiffer. Robert Redford is a superstar. Which is why I shelled out for a cinema ticket in 1996 while I was working in Canberra. The first clue should have been the turnout. There were 5 other people in the theatre. 2 left about halfway through. The recent movie that jogged my mind about Up Close and Personal was "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World". Steve Carell and Keira Knightly...how could you go wrong? At the end of that movie, and after I'd said "is that it?" I remembered 1996. 2 big stars of the moment, an interesting premise, but a total turkey. What the 2 movies had in common was a couple of actors walking through their lines with as much feeling and believability as the bored woman who sold me the tickets at the counter. Absolutely no chemistry, no connection with the audience; you could almost hear Pfeiffer and Redford thinking 'is this over yet?' Contrast this with Pfeiffer's other 1996 effort One Fine Day, and you see that her heart is still in it. Whereas Redford's efforts since this stinker have been mediocre at best. Up Close & Personal was so bad that it took nearly 17 years for Carell's non-effort to knock it off my Worst Movie mantle.

    It goes on, and on, and on, the same thread repeated ad nauseum: will he (Robert Redford) get her (Michelle Pfeiffer)? Does Santa's lady still darn socks? Mr Redford seems to have run out of gas. He's the one who mentors the pretty news girl, but where's their personal situation going,up or down? Before long, this viewer didn't care--their characters weren't strong enough to build or deserve any empathy with the audience. Ms Pfeiffer, as all know,rose to prominence as a model, and it has been her stronger suite; she reached modest heights as an actress, and now in her 50s, still has a very busy movie schedule. Mr Redford plays much the same role in each of his (fewer and fewer) movies, that of the movie actor Robert Redford. This viewer went from disinterested to bored and then sleep before exiting. It's the worst response you can give any film, save burning down the cinema or local DVD outlet.

    Technically this is a well done movie. The scenes are constructed well, the cinematography is excellent, the acting is fine. At the end of the day what one is left with is a LifeTime Movie Network movie. A pretty LMN film that is better than most of the material the network runs...but it is LMN fare. **SPOILER** The end says it all: Cat Woman is at an office farewell party. She is the glory of the party. Everyone hangs on her every word describing the events that have just been witnessed. The TV is turned on and the dramatic build of the death of Jeremiah Johnson occurs where at first Mrs. Montana is the only person to realize who's sole of who's shoe laying on the ground. The dramatic build is heightened by...by...a glass of champagne falling at hitting the ground!!!!! WOW!!!!!!! Then comes the obligatory shameless acting cry and wail. Can't you just feel the tears jerking out of the audience!!!! Play it as it Lays, Michelle, Play it hard. Play it like Susan Lucci! If you think that this is life you need to get one. If you like this soapy teary weepy waily incredibly constructed climax then this is a 10 max film for you.

    There is an advantage when the fare on television is so bland that the box of purchased DVDs comes out of the closet: some of those oldies are so good that they make the current crop of contemporary comedy/drama love stories inept. Such is the case in viewing the very popular 1996 film UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, a film whose nidus is Alanna Nash's expos&eacute; book 'Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch' adapted and remolded for the screen by no less than Joan Didion and John Gregroy Dunne, under the careful and tidy direction of Jon Avnet, and starring two of screen's most popular talents Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. The film suggests the Jessica Savitch story, the newswoman who, in the 1970's, became the "First Woman Anchor". Sally/Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is from the other side of the tracks in Reno who is obsessed with becoming a news star. She fakes her r&eacute;sum&eacute;, barges into an important television studio run by the indomitable Warren Justice, fakes is and fails as a weather forecaster, yet is so refreshingly purposeful that she is taken under the wing of Warren in a Miami newsroom, given not only a makeover in appearance, but also the chance to make a difference in a news story involving the sad plight of Cuban exiles swimming to freedom in Florida, and becomes a news star on TV. There is a chemistry between the two and despite Warren's tendency to marry and divorce frequently the two fall in love. Yet despite her love for Warren, she takes the big chance and moves on to Philadelphia, where he follows to rescue her faltering career at the cost of his own - as she rises he falls. It is a love story and more - a Pygmalion reshaping of a true tale. Both Redford and Pfeiffer look and act great and they are surrounded by a fine cast of extras - Stockard Channing, Kate Nelligan, Joe Mantegna, etc. Nice to remember when love stories were not just about potty mouth derring-do, but instead were well written and well crafted little films.

    I don't know how anyone could watch this movie and not love it. The line up of actors in the move are amazing and maybe that's why some people expected a different kind of movie. The movie moves a long perfectly, telling the story in a great time line. It doesn't drag and there is not one part of the story that doesn't fit. It's as if a friend is telling you the main highlights of a friends' love life. I gave it a ten - Redford an Pfieffer make a great, believable couple and you can tell they put their heart into this movie. They both play people who are intelligent and aren't afraid to fight for what they believe it, something we all strive for. Get a tissue, you'll need it.

    I find it ironic, that the movie recommendations given by IMDb for other movies "similar" to "Up Close and Personal" are NONE of the other versions of it. (A Star is Born, 1937, A Star is Born, 1954, A Star is Born, 1976. And... now I have to add something else, because my short comment, though to the point, is not long enough to leave as a comment. "Your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text." How do you figure out how much to say, when you have said enough? Should I make out my Christmas wish list? Or Maybe... I can make suggestions for new couples that can be hired to remake this re-make? mmmmm... George Clooney. Yeah... Thats good...

    As someone who works in the news business, I cringe, laugh and cry when I watch Up Close and Personal. It bears almost no resemblance except for a broad outline of what life in local and network TV news is all about. Broadcast News is a far more apt portrayal of the real pressures of a newsroom. And yet, Up Close and Personal is more fun to watch, especially on a rainy afternoon with a big bucket of popcorn and some Kleenex nearby. Robert Redford, Stockard Channing and Kate Nelligan give good performances while Joe Mantegna has one of the most delightful character names ever in a movie: Bucky Terranova. Michelle Pfeiffer is the weakest link and her prison scenes are ludicrous, but her Miami wardrobe and hair are stunning. She plays well off Robert Redford, who for once loses his wooden quality and actually seems to have some chemistry with her. It's hard to imagine that Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne actually wrote this movie, since it's such a potboiler and nothing like their finest work. But on the other hand, it proves that they really were romantics. I put this in the same category as "The Best of Everything" and "Designing Woman" (the original, starring Lauren Bacall.) You can't call them great movies, but they have charm of their own.

    Usually I like to research a movie for fun before watching it. I don't like to waste time watching a movie for 2 or 3 hours. What I learned is that this movie is based on "Jessica Savitch" who in the 1970s became the first female American anchor on television. The movie was based on the book " Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch" written by Alanna Nash. The movie is said not to be as accurate in detail and also over dramatize and exaggerate events. Also emphasizing on aspects that are debatable. So the movie might be leaning more towards fiction, then of true events. But that's debatable. I didn't give the movie a rating because after 20 minutes i couldn't bare to watch anymore. The movie had nothing to draw me in at all. Nothing to captivate me into sitting there and watching it for free. I suppose if you are the type that like to judge a movie after watching it then the best thing for you to do is watch the whole thing.

In reading up on the film, I learned it was supposed to be based on the life of Jessica Savitch, a newscaster I remember quite well, although I forgot how she died. I have a feeling the producers/director were in a damned if we do, and damned if we don't situation here. They were inspired by Savitch's life story, but wanted to make a love story, instead. If they just told the love story, and weren't open about the Savitch angle, they'd be criticized. If they made it clear the story came from the Savitch bio, but didn't make it a documentary/fiction story, they'd be criticized as well. They should have just shut up about where the inspiration for the story came from. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Now, as to saying that I really liked this film, there is a huge "except" here. I see no reason in a romantic story like this to kill of one of the two major characters. Yes, I (and apparently most people) wanted a happy ending. I was disappointed to see Redford killed at the end...and I see no good reason that was the way it ended. The film just edged down a notch for me. But, perhaps the problem with the film is that when you begin watching it you think it's one thing -- a romance story with some humor...but then it turns deadly serious. Another thing that would have helped would have been some timelines, particularly in Tally's time in Miami. It was difficult to get a sense of how long it took her to go from desk work, to weather, to reporter, etc. The acting here is superb. Redford, who was pretty much always at the top of his game, was here, also. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent, as well. It's too bad she's not been in such wonderful roles in recent years. This is very much Redford's and Pfeiffer's film. Sure there are supporting actors, but none that have memorable roles, although their performances are all very good. It seems as if this film suffered from a bit of an identity confusion. But I still liked it...very much...except for the ending.

    I love Michelle Pfeiffer. Robert Redford is a superstar. Which is why I shelled out for a cinema ticket in 1996 while I was working in Canberra. The first clue should have been the turnout. There were 5 other people in the theatre. 2 left about halfway through. The recent movie that jogged my mind about Up Close and Personal was "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World". Steve Carell and Keira Knightly...how could you go wrong? At the end of that movie, and after I'd said "is that it?" I remembered 1996. 2 big stars of the moment, an interesting premise, but a total turkey. What the 2 movies had in common was a couple of actors walking through their lines with as much feeling and believability as the bored woman who sold me the tickets at the counter. Absolutely no chemistry, no connection with the audience; you could almost hear Pfeiffer and Redford thinking 'is this over yet?' Contrast this with Pfeiffer's other 1996 effort One Fine Day, and you see that her heart is still in it. Whereas Redford's efforts since this stinker have been mediocre at best. Up Close & Personal was so bad that it took nearly 17 years for Carell's non-effort to knock it off my Worst Movie mantle.

    It goes on, and on, and on, the same thread repeated ad nauseum: will he (Robert Redford) get her (Michelle Pfeiffer)? Does Santa's lady still darn socks? Mr Redford seems to have run out of gas. He's the one who mentors the pretty news girl, but where's their personal situation going,up or down? Before long, this viewer didn't care--their characters weren't strong enough to build or deserve any empathy with the audience. Ms Pfeiffer, as all know,rose to prominence as a model, and it has been her stronger suite; she reached modest heights as an actress, and now in her 50s, still has a very busy movie schedule. Mr Redford plays much the same role in each of his (fewer and fewer) movies, that of the movie actor Robert Redford. This viewer went from disinterested to bored and then sleep before exiting. It's the worst response you can give any film, save burning down the cinema or local DVD outlet.

    Technically this is a well done movie. The scenes are constructed well, the cinematography is excellent, the acting is fine. At the end of the day what one is left with is a LifeTime Movie Network movie. A pretty LMN film that is better than most of the material the network runs...but it is LMN fare. **SPOILER** The end says it all: Cat Woman is at an office farewell party. She is the glory of the party. Everyone hangs on her every word describing the events that have just been witnessed. The TV is turned on and the dramatic build of the death of Jeremiah Johnson occurs where at first Mrs. Montana is the only person to realize who's sole of who's shoe laying on the ground. The dramatic build is heightened by...by...a glass of champagne falling at hitting the ground!!!!! WOW!!!!!!! Then comes the obligatory shameless acting cry and wail. Can't you just feel the tears jerking out of the audience!!!! Play it as it Lays, Michelle, Play it hard. Play it like Susan Lucci! If you think that this is life you need to get one. If you like this soapy teary weepy waily incredibly constructed climax then this is a 10 max film for you.

    There is an advantage when the fare on television is so bland that the box of purchased DVDs comes out of the closet: some of those oldies are so good that they make the current crop of contemporary comedy/drama love stories inept. Such is the case in viewing the very popular 1996 film UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, a film whose nidus is Alanna Nash's expos&eacute; book 'Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch' adapted and remolded for the screen by no less than Joan Didion and John Gregroy Dunne, under the careful and tidy direction of Jon Avnet, and starring two of screen's most popular talents Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. The film suggests the Jessica Savitch story, the newswoman who, in the 1970's, became the "First Woman Anchor". Sally/Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is from the other side of the tracks in Reno who is obsessed with becoming a news star. She fakes her r&eacute;sum&eacute;, barges into an important television studio run by the indomitable Warren Justice, fakes is and fails as a weather forecaster, yet is so refreshingly purposeful that she is taken under the wing of Warren in a Miami newsroom, given not only a makeover in appearance, but also the chance to make a difference in a news story involving the sad plight of Cuban exiles swimming to freedom in Florida, and becomes a news star on TV. There is a chemistry between the two and despite Warren's tendency to marry and divorce frequently the two fall in love. Yet despite her love for Warren, she takes the big chance and moves on to Philadelphia, where he follows to rescue her faltering career at the cost of his own - as she rises he falls. It is a love story and more - a Pygmalion reshaping of a true tale. Both Redford and Pfeiffer look and act great and they are surrounded by a fine cast of extras - Stockard Channing, Kate Nelligan, Joe Mantegna, etc. Nice to remember when love stories were not just about potty mouth derring-do, but instead were well written and well crafted little films.

    I don't know how anyone could watch this movie and not love it. The line up of actors in the move are amazing and maybe that's why some people expected a different kind of movie. The movie moves a long perfectly, telling the story in a great time line. It doesn't drag and there is not one part of the story that doesn't fit. It's as if a friend is telling you the main highlights of a friends' love life. I gave it a ten - Redford an Pfieffer make a great, believable couple and you can tell they put their heart into this movie. They both play people who are intelligent and aren't afraid to fight for what they believe it, something we all strive for. Get a tissue, you'll need it.

    I find it ironic, that the movie recommendations given by IMDb for other movies "similar" to "Up Close and Personal" are NONE of the other versions of it. (A Star is Born, 1937, A Star is Born, 1954, A Star is Born, 1976. And... now I have to add something else, because my short comment, though to the point, is not long enough to leave as a comment. "Your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text." How do you figure out how much to say, when you have said enough? Should I make out my Christmas wish list? Or Maybe... I can make suggestions for new couples that can be hired to remake this re-make? mmmmm... George Clooney. Yeah... Thats good...

    As someone who works in the news business, I cringe, laugh and cry when I watch Up Close and Personal. It bears almost no resemblance except for a broad outline of what life in local and network TV news is all about. Broadcast News is a far more apt portrayal of the real pressures of a newsroom. And yet, Up Close and Personal is more fun to watch, especially on a rainy afternoon with a big bucket of popcorn and some Kleenex nearby. Robert Redford, Stockard Channing and Kate Nelligan give good performances while Joe Mantegna has one of the most delightful character names ever in a movie: Bucky Terranova. Michelle Pfeiffer is the weakest link and her prison scenes are ludicrous, but her Miami wardrobe and hair are stunning. She plays well off Robert Redford, who for once loses his wooden quality and actually seems to have some chemistry with her. It's hard to imagine that Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne actually wrote this movie, since it's such a potboiler and nothing like their finest work. But on the other hand, it proves that they really were romantics. I put this in the same category as "The Best of Everything" and "Designing Woman" (the original, starring Lauren Bacall.) You can't call them great movies, but they have charm of their own.

    Usually I like to research a movie for fun before watching it. I don't like to waste time watching a movie for 2 or 3 hours. What I learned is that this movie is based on "Jessica Savitch" who in the 1970s became the first female American anchor on television. The movie was based on the book " Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch" written by Alanna Nash. The movie is said not to be as accurate in detail and also over dramatize and exaggerate events. Also emphasizing on aspects that are debatable. So the movie might be leaning more towards fiction, then of true events. But that's debatable. I didn't give the movie a rating because after 20 minutes i couldn't bare to watch anymore. The movie had nothing to draw me in at all. Nothing to captivate me into sitting there and watching it for free. I suppose if you are the type that like to judge a movie after watching it then the best thing for you to do is watch the whole thing.

    ...the fact that the interaction between the characters at times is very stilted. A particular scene in which Warren Justice (Robert Redford) is telling Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) how to put a news story together is particularly telling. Their dialogue is an interaction that has a noticeable pause between each line, and it made me think that perhaps it had not been well directed. The scenes don't always seems a smooth continuance. The sub-story regarding the siege at Holbrook Prison was lengthy and took a large part of the movie. Whilst it portrayed Tally's growing talent and removal from Justice's Svengali-like influence, it, for me, broke the continuancy of the movie. But despite this, the movie really struck a chord with me. It is one of the few movies I bought on DVD that I watch repeatedly. For some enigmatic reason, I love the movie despite the obvious flaws.
