 <sinopse>
  The daughter of a Native American tribe chief and English soldier share a romance when English colonists invade 17th century Virginia.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Capt. John Smith leads a rag-tag band of English sailors & soldiers to the New World to plunder its riches for England (or, more precisely, for Governor Ratcliffe, who comes along for the ride). Meanwhile, in this "New World," Chief Powhatan has pledged his daughter, Pocahontas, to be married to the village's greatest warrior. Pocahontas, however, has other ideas. She has seen a vision of a spinning arrow, a vision she believes tells her change is coming. Her life does indeed change when the English ship lands near her village. Between Ratcliffe, who believes the "savages" are hiding the gold he expected to be plentiful, and Powhatan, who believes these pale newcomers will destroy their land, Smith and Pocahontas have a difficult time preventing all-out war, and saving their love for each other.

    I absolutely adore this movie. It's amazing and I am so pleased that I watched this movie. The thing that really opened my eyes was the fact that it's a true story although Disney added their own bits and pieces and of course the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. I try to forget that the second movie ever existed, I was so sad and disappointed when Pocahontas didn't leave with John but it also gave it a bittersweet ending and of course, fanfiction which I love. This movie deserves to be in the top 5 of Disney's greatest masterpieces. Instead of the typical happy lovey dovey ending, we're given a settling outburst of emotion, joy and love. Recommended for all ages.

    I really loved the music and how it moved... the orchestrations were very smart and at moments complex (polyphony) and the lyrics really contributed to the story's very serious undertone. The portrayal of Native Americans in the media has always been (and justly so) a sensitive subject but I am happy to report that it appears this movie has done it with great taste and respect for the culture. The animation is great and certain sequences (most notably "Colors of the Wind" are just masterful. I could actually feel the wind at the end! A great watch! An important film... not a popcorn Disney (like some recent ones) Bravo!

    After one viewing, I am not sure what I think about the story of this movie. It doesn't feel like a typical children's movie, although I watched it with a group of 5 year-olds, and it totally kept them interested (the rating should probably be PG because of the violence--one character is shot to death pretty prominently). I thought in terms of subject matter, things were handled well. My feeling on presenting history inaccurately is that you shouldn't be expecting Disney movies to be faithful to anything other than marketability. Where the movie surprised me is how amazing it was visually. You can tell that's where the work really went into, and the time spent developing the look of the characters totally paid off. I'll watch this one again.

    I recently just watched this movie and was shocked how great this movie really is. I'm surprised how negative everyone is about the historical accuracy. It's a Disney movie, an animated children's movie. Of course, it's not suppose to accurate. The point of the movie is to deliver a message to children, not to teach 6, 7, 8 year olds historical facts. Yes this movie is "hollywood-ized" but like I said it's a Disney film whose purpose is to entertain not to inform. It delivers a beautiful message especially with the song savages. Both sides sing the same song to show how similar they are. They had this message earlier with the song, "Colors of the Wind". Also, it teaches children to follow their hearts and not follow the crowd/mob mentality. If you're really judging this movie solely on historical accuracy, that is just plain dumb. I mean seriously, are you really trying to teach your kids history through a Disney movie.

    Underwhelming. That was my first thought after finishing Pocahontas. Granted, my expectations may have been a bit high, but this IS renaissance Disney after all. Frankly, Pocahontas is not one of Disney's greats, or even one of their goods. It's a mediocre film with some marvelous musical numbers placed between uninteresting filler. Loosely based off of the real story of Pocahontas, this romance is formula, formula, formula. Pocahontas is forced to marry an unwanted suitor. She falls in love with a forbidden man. In this case, that man is John Smith. John Smith, being European, and known for killing savages, is of course, initially opposed by the tribe Pocahontas comes from. But John Smith comes to understand the Indians as intelligent and resourceful people, though the villainous Governor Radcliffe is less easily convinced. Even at a lean run time of 84 minutes (I viewed the 10th anniversary version which includes one additional song, and some extra animation), Pocahontas feels far too long. Simply put, Pocahontas is a bit of a bore. Most of the time, I was just waiting for the next song to start, as they represented the only interesting parts of the film. Attempts at humor are few. Successful humor is even more rare. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story was more interesting, or the characters more unique. And yet, we have clich&eacute;d stereotypes, or even worse; completely personality-less individuals that seem to have little purpose in the film. Pocahontas is free-spirited and adventurous; in other words, she is completely indistinguishable with almost any of Disney's other princesses. John Smith has no personality, period. And Governor Radcliffe is the traditional evil villain, who has a distinctly and curiously lazy-feeling motive for his villainy. The musical numbers are superb, though. While not as catchy or as magical as the best Disney songs of this era, Pocahontas still boasts it's share of enjoyable songs. "The Virginia March" is a delightfully retro Disney song. It would've felt right at home in some of Disney's oldest films. "Just Around the Riverbend" is a lively and joyous number, while "Mine, Mine, Mine" has a wonderfully grand finish, and fun lyrics. "Colors of the Wind" is possibly the best song in the film, with great music, beautiful lyrics, and the best visuals in the film. The only song in the film I didn't enjoy was "If I Never Knew You." This number was specifically added for the 10th anniversary edition, and it's formulaic, dull, and instantly forgettable. The cast is weak. Irene Bedard and Mel Gibson provide generic and colorless voices for Pocahontas and John Smith respectively. Russel Means and James Fall were noticeably poor as key characters in Pocahontas' tribe. Only David Odgen Stiers (portraying Governor Radcliffe, and his servant Wiggins) shows any kind of energy in his performance. The animation is breath taking, not that I would expect anything less from Disney. There's one scene at the end where Pocahontas is racing to her village to stop a potential war that's simply stunning. If nothing else, Disney has not slouched in their animation department when making Pocahontas. The score by Alan Menken is predictably great. Applying the excellent themes from the various songs into the score, Menken has composed another success. It's beautifully written, and often outshines the events on screen. Not funny, not interesting, and terribly dull, Pocahontas is one of Disney's weaker films. While the songs are great, and the animation is gorgeous, Pocahontas can't capture the magic of other Disney films of the Disney Renaissance Era. The wonderful songs may stick in my memory, but the scenes inbetween are already being forgotten.

    Most of the animation movies are about immature girl falling in love with a stranger from another place and then leaving with the crush into his own world. Although that's where the movies end, i am always curious about what would happen after the movie!! This is where i found the ending of the movie very good. it showed, she has character, leadership, strength and is caring for her people. Another aspect I liked was how she sneaked out, and he sneaked out, and both tried to keep it secret, it makes it more realistic. Also I liked the honesty in the movie, how even a sincere guy thinks the natives are savages, uncivilized, and how the captain came for gold, greed and land, and who wanted to wipe out the "race". Although in reality that is exactly what happened, in the movie, things turned out better. At least it made me believe and hope that may be something like this actually happened, somewhere in the world. Remember British did not just come to America, they did colonize practically the whole world. And overall the lesson is good, just because we are different does not mean the others are savages, or inhuman. Just because a group has more technology, does not make them civilized either. And there is more to life, nature, spirituality, the 4th dimension, than just materials and wealth. And "sometimes the right thing to do is not always the easiest one". Its a good watch, but its definitely not for children, its more for thinking adults!

    Pocahontas is an amazing movie. I honestly don't think I'd be who I am today with out it. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. The animation's beautiful, the songs are to die for, and the story is great. Yes, it doesn't follow the true story, but that wouldn't really make a good kid's movie, would it? It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism. The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like "you will not hurt me"). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song "Colors of the Wind", my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by "Drums of War." I won't give away any more. But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes? Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing. I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well. This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a "kid's movie". I know I'll be showing my kids when I'm older!!!

    when i saw this movie the first time, i found it beautiful, it has been my favorite movie through all this years, it's just beautiful, i cant get it how the hell it is rated with 6.3 stars. because she is the most beautiful and the bravest girl of all time! i haven't seen this for a long long time, and i can tell you for sure that this is one of the best animations of all time, because this is full of teachings, a true love tale, and above all they leave us with a big expectation of what happens next, because, you see, it doesn't matter if there is a sequel, for me Pocahontas 2 is like it has never existed, because every time we see this movie we will think of how great the human spirit can be, how great this movie makes us feel. and i know that you may not understand or agree with all I'm saying but, this is from the bottom of my childish heart, and no matter what happens ever, i will let my intern child live, and my children, if someday i have some, they will certainly see this good all classics.

    I'll be honest, Pocahontas is the Disney movie of the 90's that appeals to me the least. For nearly a year, I've heard some negative statements about the movie from a couple of the teachers at my high school (they both teach history, keep in mind). In the past, Disney has been known for their adaptations of classic literature... but a historical figure was obviously not the best choice for their next movie after the immense success of The Lion King, and it shows. While the artwork is good, the music is good and such, the story is very weak and predictable. Note that this sort of plot has been used by various movies, including Avatar and Dances with Wolves. And on top of that, this film is a grossly inaccurate representation of Native American history, with the conflict between the British and Natives toned down to be little more than a simple fight between two sides that almost never happens thanks to Pocahontas saving John Smith. However, I do give the movie credit for casting First Nations actors to voice the Natives, such as the late Russell Means as Chief Powhatan and Gordon Tootoosis as Kekata. Sure the backgrounds and character designs for the humans are realistic and look great, but the story is also important for an animated movie, and in the case of a movie based on history or culture, historical and cultural accuracy. Fortunately, the film has a good message, "Everyone is different and people are people no matter how they look", but Disney has not always been good at teaching that to children, like The Fox and the Hound, which had a good message but in this case, it was not clear on target audience. On top of that, there should be better ways to teach children that it's OK to be different. So really, I don't know whether to recommend it or not. Maybe it would be best to watch it with children and explain some things about it later so that children aren't mislead by this movie.

    Pocahontas (1995) *** (out of 4) Disney's version of the relationship between Englishman John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson) and Pocahontas (voice of). This here was the studio's 33rd film and while it's far from a classic, overall the animation is good enough to make it worth sitting through. It should go without saying but history buffs might want to stay away from this but then again, this here is a Disney movie so I'm not sure why people should come into this wanting a documentary. I remember when the film was released there was a lot of promotional material about how respectful the film was going to be towards Native Americans and for the most part I think this is very true. I thought the film did a pretty good job at showing the good quality of both sides and the film managed to give enough of the history to where young kids should be able to enjoy the film as entertainment as well as get a fair idea of what happened during this period. I think what works best about the film is the animation, which shows the studio at the top of their game. I really loved the dim blue colors that highlight the majority of the film and especially the scenes inside the woods. The beautiful red skies is another major plus and there's no question that the characters all look extremely good and well-drawn. I thought Gibson did a very good job with his vocal work but the rest of the actors are fine as well. The animal creatures are another plus with the raccoon certainly being the standout. I think there are some major flaws here including every single song. There really wasn't a single one that impressed me and this is somewhat of a shock considering the hot streak that the studio was on. POCAHONTAS isn't classic Disney but fans of the company should at least be entertained by it.

It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism. The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like "you will not hurt me"). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song "Colors of the Wind", my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by "Drums of War." I won't give away any more. But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes? Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing. I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well. This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a "kid's movie". I know I'll be showing my kids when I'm older!!!

    when i saw this movie the first time, i found it beautiful, it has been my favorite movie through all this years, it's just beautiful, i cant get it how the hell it is rated with 6.3 stars. because she is the most beautiful and the bravest girl of all time! i haven't seen this for a long long time, and i can tell you for sure that this is one of the best animations of all time, because this is full of teachings, a true love tale, and above all they leave us with a big expectation of what happens next, because, you see, it doesn't matter if there is a sequel, for me Pocahontas 2 is like it has never existed, because every time we see this movie we will think of how great the human spirit can be, how great this movie makes us feel. and i know that you may not understand or agree with all I'm saying but, this is from the bottom of my childish heart, and no matter what happens ever, i will let my intern child live, and my children, if someday i have some, they will certainly see this good all classics.

    I'll be honest, Pocahontas is the Disney movie of the 90's that appeals to me the least. For nearly a year, I've heard some negative statements about the movie from a couple of the teachers at my high school (they both teach history, keep in mind). In the past, Disney has been known for their adaptations of classic literature... but a historical figure was obviously not the best choice for their next movie after the immense success of The Lion King, and it shows. While the artwork is good, the music is good and such, the story is very weak and predictable. Note that this sort of plot has been used by various movies, including Avatar and Dances with Wolves. And on top of that, this film is a grossly inaccurate representation of Native American history, with the conflict between the British and Natives toned down to be little more than a simple fight between two sides that almost never happens thanks to Pocahontas saving John Smith. However, I do give the movie credit for casting First Nations actors to voice the Natives, such as the late Russell Means as Chief Powhatan and Gordon Tootoosis as Kekata. Sure the backgrounds and character designs for the humans are realistic and look great, but the story is also important for an animated movie, and in the case of a movie based on history or culture, historical and cultural accuracy. Fortunately, the film has a good message, "Everyone is different and people are people no matter how they look", but Disney has not always been good at teaching that to children, like The Fox and the Hound, which had a good message but in this case, it was not clear on target audience. On top of that, there should be better ways to teach children that it's OK to be different. So really, I don't know whether to recommend it or not. Maybe it would be best to watch it with children and explain some things about it later so that children aren't mislead by this movie.

    Pocahontas (1995) *** (out of 4) Disney's version of the relationship between Englishman John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson) and Pocahontas (voice of). This here was the studio's 33rd film and while it's far from a classic, overall the animation is good enough to make it worth sitting through. It should go without saying but history buffs might want to stay away from this but then again, this here is a Disney movie so I'm not sure why people should come into this wanting a documentary. I remember when the film was released there was a lot of promotional material about how respectful the film was going to be towards Native Americans and for the most part I think this is very true. I thought the film did a pretty good job at showing the good quality of both sides and the film managed to give enough of the history to where young kids should be able to enjoy the film as entertainment as well as get a fair idea of what happened during this period. I think what works best about the film is the animation, which shows the studio at the top of their game. I really loved the dim blue colors that highlight the majority of the film and especially the scenes inside the woods. The beautiful red skies is another major plus and there's no question that the characters all look extremely good and well-drawn. I thought Gibson did a very good job with his vocal work but the rest of the actors are fine as well. The animal creatures are another plus with the raccoon certainly being the standout. I think there are some major flaws here including every single song. There really wasn't a single one that impressed me and this is somewhat of a shock considering the hot streak that the studio was on. POCAHONTAS isn't classic Disney but fans of the company should at least be entertained by it.

    I absolutely adore this movie. It's amazing and I am so pleased that I watched this movie. The thing that really opened my eyes was the fact that it's a true story although Disney added their own bits and pieces and of course the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. I try to forget that the second movie ever existed, I was so sad and disappointed when Pocahontas didn't leave with John but it also gave it a bittersweet ending and of course, fanfiction which I love. This movie deserves to be in the top 5 of Disney's greatest masterpieces. Instead of the typical happy lovey dovey ending, we're given a settling outburst of emotion, joy and love. Recommended for all ages.

    I really loved the music and how it moved... the orchestrations were very smart and at moments complex (polyphony) and the lyrics really contributed to the story's very serious undertone. The portrayal of Native Americans in the media has always been (and justly so) a sensitive subject but I am happy to report that it appears this movie has done it with great taste and respect for the culture. The animation is great and certain sequences (most notably "Colors of the Wind" are just masterful. I could actually feel the wind at the end! A great watch! An important film... not a popcorn Disney (like some recent ones) Bravo!

    After one viewing, I am not sure what I think about the story of this movie. It doesn't feel like a typical children's movie, although I watched it with a group of 5 year-olds, and it totally kept them interested (the rating should probably be PG because of the violence--one character is shot to death pretty prominently). I thought in terms of subject matter, things were handled well. My feeling on presenting history inaccurately is that you shouldn't be expecting Disney movies to be faithful to anything other than marketability. Where the movie surprised me is how amazing it was visually. You can tell that's where the work really went into, and the time spent developing the look of the characters totally paid off. I'll watch this one again.

    I recently just watched this movie and was shocked how great this movie really is. I'm surprised how negative everyone is about the historical accuracy. It's a Disney movie, an animated children's movie. Of course, it's not suppose to accurate. The point of the movie is to deliver a message to children, not to teach 6, 7, 8 year olds historical facts. Yes this movie is "hollywood-ized" but like I said it's a Disney film whose purpose is to entertain not to inform. It delivers a beautiful message especially with the song savages. Both sides sing the same song to show how similar they are. They had this message earlier with the song, "Colors of the Wind". Also, it teaches children to follow their hearts and not follow the crowd/mob mentality. If you're really judging this movie solely on historical accuracy, that is just plain dumb. I mean seriously, are you really trying to teach your kids history through a Disney movie.

    Underwhelming. That was my first thought after finishing Pocahontas. Granted, my expectations may have been a bit high, but this IS renaissance Disney after all. Frankly, Pocahontas is not one of Disney's greats, or even one of their goods. It's a mediocre film with some marvelous musical numbers placed between uninteresting filler. Loosely based off of the real story of Pocahontas, this romance is formula, formula, formula. Pocahontas is forced to marry an unwanted suitor. She falls in love with a forbidden man. In this case, that man is John Smith. John Smith, being European, and known for killing savages, is of course, initially opposed by the tribe Pocahontas comes from. But John Smith comes to understand the Indians as intelligent and resourceful people, though the villainous Governor Radcliffe is less easily convinced. Even at a lean run time of 84 minutes (I viewed the 10th anniversary version which includes one additional song, and some extra animation), Pocahontas feels far too long. Simply put, Pocahontas is a bit of a bore. Most of the time, I was just waiting for the next song to start, as they represented the only interesting parts of the film. Attempts at humor are few. Successful humor is even more rare. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story was more interesting, or the characters more unique. And yet, we have clich&eacute;d stereotypes, or even worse; completely personality-less individuals that seem to have little purpose in the film. Pocahontas is free-spirited and adventurous; in other words, she is completely indistinguishable with almost any of Disney's other princesses. John Smith has no personality, period. And Governor Radcliffe is the traditional evil villain, who has a distinctly and curiously lazy-feeling motive for his villainy. The musical numbers are superb, though. While not as catchy or as magical as the best Disney songs of this era, Pocahontas still boasts it's share of enjoyable songs. "The Virginia March" is a delightfully retro Disney song. It would've felt right at home in some of Disney's oldest films. "Just Around the Riverbend" is a lively and joyous number, while "Mine, Mine, Mine" has a wonderfully grand finish, and fun lyrics. "Colors of the Wind" is possibly the best song in the film, with great music, beautiful lyrics, and the best visuals in the film. The only song in the film I didn't enjoy was "If I Never Knew You." This number was specifically added for the 10th anniversary edition, and it's formulaic, dull, and instantly forgettable. The cast is weak. Irene Bedard and Mel Gibson provide generic and colorless voices for Pocahontas and John Smith respectively. Russel Means and James Fall were noticeably poor as key characters in Pocahontas' tribe. Only David Odgen Stiers (portraying Governor Radcliffe, and his servant Wiggins) shows any kind of energy in his performance. The animation is breath taking, not that I would expect anything less from Disney. There's one scene at the end where Pocahontas is racing to her village to stop a potential war that's simply stunning. If nothing else, Disney has not slouched in their animation department when making Pocahontas. The score by Alan Menken is predictably great. Applying the excellent themes from the various songs into the score, Menken has composed another success. It's beautifully written, and often outshines the events on screen. Not funny, not interesting, and terribly dull, Pocahontas is one of Disney's weaker films. While the songs are great, and the animation is gorgeous, Pocahontas can't capture the magic of other Disney films of the Disney Renaissance Era. The wonderful songs may stick in my memory, but the scenes inbetween are already being forgotten.

    Most of the animation movies are about immature girl falling in love with a stranger from another place and then leaving with the crush into his own world. Although that's where the movies end, i am always curious about what would happen after the movie!! This is where i found the ending of the movie very good. it showed, she has character, leadership, strength and is caring for her people. Another aspect I liked was how she sneaked out, and he sneaked out, and both tried to keep it secret, it makes it more realistic. Also I liked the honesty in the movie, how even a sincere guy thinks the natives are savages, uncivilized, and how the captain came for gold, greed and land, and who wanted to wipe out the "race". Although in reality that is exactly what happened, in the movie, things turned out better. At least it made me believe and hope that may be something like this actually happened, somewhere in the world. Remember British did not just come to America, they did colonize practically the whole world. And overall the lesson is good, just because we are different does not mean the others are savages, or inhuman. Just because a group has more technology, does not make them civilized either. And there is more to life, nature, spirituality, the 4th dimension, than just materials and wealth. And "sometimes the right thing to do is not always the easiest one". Its a good watch, but its definitely not for children, its more for thinking adults!

    Underwhelming. That was my first thought after finishing Pocahontas. Granted, my expectations may have been a bit high, but this IS renaissance Disney after all. Frankly, Pocahontas is not one of Disney's greats, or even one of their goods. It's a mediocre film with some marvelous musical numbers placed between uninteresting filler. Loosely based off of the real story of Pocahontas, this romance is formula, formula, formula. Pocahontas is forced to marry an unwanted suitor. She falls in love with a forbidden man. In this case, that man is John Smith. John Smith, being European, and known for killing savages, is of course, initially opposed by the tribe Pocahontas comes from. But John Smith comes to understand the Indians as intelligent and resourceful people, though the villainous Governor Radcliffe is less easily convinced. Even at a lean run time of 84 minutes (I viewed the 10th anniversary version which includes one additional song, and some extra animation), Pocahontas feels far too long. Simply put, Pocahontas is a bit of a bore. Most of the time, I was just waiting for the next song to start, as they represented the only interesting parts of the film. Attempts at humor are few. Successful humor is even more rare. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story was more interesting, or the characters more unique. And yet, we have clich&eacute;d stereotypes, or even worse; completely personality-less individuals that seem to have little purpose in the film. Pocahontas is free-spirited and adventurous; in other words, she is completely indistinguishable with almost any of Disney's other princesses. John Smith has no personality, period. And Governor Radcliffe is the traditional evil villain, who has a distinctly and curiously lazy-feeling motive for his villainy. The musical numbers are superb, though. While not as catchy or as magical as the best Disney songs of this era, Pocahontas still boasts it's share of enjoyable songs. "The Virginia March" is a delightfully retro Disney song. It would've felt right at home in some of Disney's oldest films. "Just Around the Riverbend" is a lively and joyous number, while "Mine, Mine, Mine" has a wonderfully grand finish, and fun lyrics. "Colors of the Wind" is possibly the best song in the film, with great music, beautiful lyrics, and the best visuals in the film. The only song in the film I didn't enjoy was "If I Never Knew You." This number was specifically added for the 10th anniversary edition, and it's formulaic, dull, and instantly forgettable. The cast is weak. Irene Bedard and Mel Gibson provide generic and colorless voices for Pocahontas and John Smith respectively. Russel Means and James Fall were noticeably poor as key characters in Pocahontas' tribe. Only David Odgen Stiers (portraying Governor Radcliffe, and his servant Wiggins) shows any kind of energy in his performance. The animation is breath taking, not that I would expect anything less from Disney. There's one scene at the end where Pocahontas is racing to her village to stop a potential war that's simply stunning. If nothing else, Disney has not slouched in their animation department when making Pocahontas. The score by Alan Menken is predictably great. Applying the excellent themes from the various songs into the score, Menken has composed another success. It's beautifully written, and often outshines the events on screen. Not funny, not interesting, and terribly dull, Pocahontas is one of Disney's weaker films. While the songs are great, and the animation is gorgeous, Pocahontas can't capture the magic of other Disney films of the Disney Renaissance Era. The wonderful songs may stick in my memory, but the scenes inbetween are already being forgotten.

    Most of the animation movies are about immature girl falling in love with a stranger from another place and then leaving with the crush into his own world. Although that's where the movies end, i am always curious about what would happen after the movie!! This is where i found the ending of the movie very good. it showed, she has character, leadership, strength and is caring for her people. Another aspect I liked was how she sneaked out, and he sneaked out, and both tried to keep it secret, it makes it more realistic. Also I liked the honesty in the movie, how even a sincere guy thinks the natives are savages, uncivilized, and how the captain came for gold, greed and land, and who wanted to wipe out the "race". Although in reality that is exactly what happened, in the movie, things turned out better. At least it made me believe and hope that may be something like this actually happened, somewhere in the world. Remember British did not just come to America, they did colonize practically the whole world. And overall the lesson is good, just because we are different does not mean the others are savages, or inhuman. Just because a group has more technology, does not make them civilized either. And there is more to life, nature, spirituality, the 4th dimension, than just materials and wealth. And "sometimes the right thing to do is not always the easiest one". Its a good watch, but its definitely not for children, its more for thinking adults!

    Pocahontas is an amazing movie. I honestly don't think I'd be who I am today with out it. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. The animation's beautiful, the songs are to die for, and the story is great. Yes, it doesn't follow the true story, but that wouldn't really make a good kid's movie, would it? It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism. The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like "you will not hurt me"). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song "Colors of the Wind", my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by "Drums of War." I won't give away any more. But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes? Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing. I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well. This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a "kid's movie". I know I'll be showing my kids when I'm older!!!

    when i saw this movie the first time, i found it beautiful, it has been my favorite movie through all this years, it's just beautiful, i cant get it how the hell it is rated with 6.3 stars. because she is the most beautiful and the bravest girl of all time! i haven't seen this for a long long time, and i can tell you for sure that this is one of the best animations of all time, because this is full of teachings, a true love tale, and above all they leave us with a big expectation of what happens next, because, you see, it doesn't matter if there is a sequel, for me Pocahontas 2 is like it has never existed, because every time we see this movie we will think of how great the human spirit can be, how great this movie makes us feel. and i know that you may not understand or agree with all I'm saying but, this is from the bottom of my childish heart, and no matter what happens ever, i will let my intern child live, and my children, if someday i have some, they will certainly see this good all classics.

    I'll be honest, Pocahontas is the Disney movie of the 90's that appeals to me the least. For nearly a year, I've heard some negative statements about the movie from a couple of the teachers at my high school (they both teach history, keep in mind). In the past, Disney has been known for their adaptations of classic literature... but a historical figure was obviously not the best choice for their next movie after the immense success of The Lion King, and it shows. While the artwork is good, the music is good and such, the story is very weak and predictable. Note that this sort of plot has been used by various movies, including Avatar and Dances with Wolves. And on top of that, this film is a grossly inaccurate representation of Native American history, with the conflict between the British and Natives toned down to be little more than a simple fight between two sides that almost never happens thanks to Pocahontas saving John Smith. However, I do give the movie credit for casting First Nations actors to voice the Natives, such as the late Russell Means as Chief Powhatan and Gordon Tootoosis as Kekata. Sure the backgrounds and character designs for the humans are realistic and look great, but the story is also important for an animated movie, and in the case of a movie based on history or culture, historical and cultural accuracy. Fortunately, the film has a good message, "Everyone is different and people are people no matter how they look", but Disney has not always been good at teaching that to children, like The Fox and the Hound, which had a good message but in this case, it was not clear on target audience. On top of that, there should be better ways to teach children that it's OK to be different. So really, I don't know whether to recommend it or not. Maybe it would be best to watch it with children and explain some things about it later so that children aren't mislead by this movie.

    Pocahontas (1995) *** (out of 4) Disney's version of the relationship between Englishman John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson) and Pocahontas (voice of). This here was the studio's 33rd film and while it's far from a classic, overall the animation is good enough to make it worth sitting through. It should go without saying but history buffs might want to stay away from this but then again, this here is a Disney movie so I'm not sure why people should come into this wanting a documentary. I remember when the film was released there was a lot of promotional material about how respectful the film was going to be towards Native Americans and for the most part I think this is very true. I thought the film did a pretty good job at showing the good quality of both sides and the film managed to give enough of the history to where young kids should be able to enjoy the film as entertainment as well as get a fair idea of what happened during this period. I think what works best about the film is the animation, which shows the studio at the top of their game. I really loved the dim blue colors that highlight the majority of the film and especially the scenes inside the woods. The beautiful red skies is another major plus and there's no question that the characters all look extremely good and well-drawn. I thought Gibson did a very good job with his vocal work but the rest of the actors are fine as well. The animal creatures are another plus with the raccoon certainly being the standout. I think there are some major flaws here including every single song. There really wasn't a single one that impressed me and this is somewhat of a shock considering the hot streak that the studio was on. POCAHONTAS isn't classic Disney but fans of the company should at least be entertained by it.

    I absolutely adore this movie. It's amazing and I am so pleased that I watched this movie. The thing that really opened my eyes was the fact that it's a true story although Disney added their own bits and pieces and of course the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. I try to forget that the second movie ever existed, I was so sad and disappointed when Pocahontas didn't leave with John but it also gave it a bittersweet ending and of course, fanfiction which I love. This movie deserves to be in the top 5 of Disney's greatest masterpieces. Instead of the typical happy lovey dovey ending, we're given a settling outburst of emotion, joy and love. Recommended for all ages.

    I really loved the music and how it moved... the orchestrations were very smart and at moments complex (polyphony) and the lyrics really contributed to the story's very serious undertone. The portrayal of Native Americans in the media has always been (and justly so) a sensitive subject but I am happy to report that it appears this movie has done it with great taste and respect for the culture. The animation is great and certain sequences (most notably "Colors of the Wind" are just masterful. I could actually feel the wind at the end! A great watch! An important film... not a popcorn Disney (like some recent ones) Bravo!

    After one viewing, I am not sure what I think about the story of this movie. It doesn't feel like a typical children's movie, although I watched it with a group of 5 year-olds, and it totally kept them interested (the rating should probably be PG because of the violence--one character is shot to death pretty prominently). I thought in terms of subject matter, things were handled well. My feeling on presenting history inaccurately is that you shouldn't be expecting Disney movies to be faithful to anything other than marketability. Where the movie surprised me is how amazing it was visually. You can tell that's where the work really went into, and the time spent developing the look of the characters totally paid off. I'll watch this one again.

    I recently just watched this movie and was shocked how great this movie really is. I'm surprised how negative everyone is about the historical accuracy. It's a Disney movie, an animated children's movie. Of course, it's not suppose to accurate. The point of the movie is to deliver a message to children, not to teach 6, 7, 8 year olds historical facts. Yes this movie is "hollywood-ized" but like I said it's a Disney film whose purpose is to entertain not to inform. It delivers a beautiful message especially with the song savages. Both sides sing the same song to show how similar they are. They had this message earlier with the song, "Colors of the Wind". Also, it teaches children to follow their hearts and not follow the crowd/mob mentality. If you're really judging this movie solely on historical accuracy, that is just plain dumb. I mean seriously, are you really trying to teach your kids history through a Disney movie.

I remember when the film was released there was a lot of promotional material about how respectful the film was going to be towards Native Americans and for the most part I think this is very true. I thought the film did a pretty good job at showing the good quality of both sides and the film managed to give enough of the history to where young kids should be able to enjoy the film as entertainment as well as get a fair idea of what happened during this period. I think what works best about the film is the animation, which shows the studio at the top of their game. I really loved the dim blue colors that highlight the majority of the film and especially the scenes inside the woods. The beautiful red skies is another major plus and there's no question that the characters all look extremely good and well-drawn. I thought Gibson did a very good job with his vocal work but the rest of the actors are fine as well. The animal creatures are another plus with the raccoon certainly being the standout. I think there are some major flaws here including every single song. There really wasn't a single one that impressed me and this is somewhat of a shock considering the hot streak that the studio was on. POCAHONTAS isn't classic Disney but fans of the company should at least be entertained by it.

    I absolutely adore this movie. It's amazing and I am so pleased that I watched this movie. The thing that really opened my eyes was the fact that it's a true story although Disney added their own bits and pieces and of course the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. I try to forget that the second movie ever existed, I was so sad and disappointed when Pocahontas didn't leave with John but it also gave it a bittersweet ending and of course, fanfiction which I love. This movie deserves to be in the top 5 of Disney's greatest masterpieces. Instead of the typical happy lovey dovey ending, we're given a settling outburst of emotion, joy and love. Recommended for all ages.

    I really loved the music and how it moved... the orchestrations were very smart and at moments complex (polyphony) and the lyrics really contributed to the story's very serious undertone. The portrayal of Native Americans in the media has always been (and justly so) a sensitive subject but I am happy to report that it appears this movie has done it with great taste and respect for the culture. The animation is great and certain sequences (most notably "Colors of the Wind" are just masterful. I could actually feel the wind at the end! A great watch! An important film... not a popcorn Disney (like some recent ones) Bravo!

    After one viewing, I am not sure what I think about the story of this movie. It doesn't feel like a typical children's movie, although I watched it with a group of 5 year-olds, and it totally kept them interested (the rating should probably be PG because of the violence--one character is shot to death pretty prominently). I thought in terms of subject matter, things were handled well. My feeling on presenting history inaccurately is that you shouldn't be expecting Disney movies to be faithful to anything other than marketability. Where the movie surprised me is how amazing it was visually. You can tell that's where the work really went into, and the time spent developing the look of the characters totally paid off. I'll watch this one again.

    I recently just watched this movie and was shocked how great this movie really is. I'm surprised how negative everyone is about the historical accuracy. It's a Disney movie, an animated children's movie. Of course, it's not suppose to accurate. The point of the movie is to deliver a message to children, not to teach 6, 7, 8 year olds historical facts. Yes this movie is "hollywood-ized" but like I said it's a Disney film whose purpose is to entertain not to inform. It delivers a beautiful message especially with the song savages. Both sides sing the same song to show how similar they are. They had this message earlier with the song, "Colors of the Wind". Also, it teaches children to follow their hearts and not follow the crowd/mob mentality. If you're really judging this movie solely on historical accuracy, that is just plain dumb. I mean seriously, are you really trying to teach your kids history through a Disney movie.

    Underwhelming. That was my first thought after finishing Pocahontas. Granted, my expectations may have been a bit high, but this IS renaissance Disney after all. Frankly, Pocahontas is not one of Disney's greats, or even one of their goods. It's a mediocre film with some marvelous musical numbers placed between uninteresting filler. Loosely based off of the real story of Pocahontas, this romance is formula, formula, formula. Pocahontas is forced to marry an unwanted suitor. She falls in love with a forbidden man. In this case, that man is John Smith. John Smith, being European, and known for killing savages, is of course, initially opposed by the tribe Pocahontas comes from. But John Smith comes to understand the Indians as intelligent and resourceful people, though the villainous Governor Radcliffe is less easily convinced. Even at a lean run time of 84 minutes (I viewed the 10th anniversary version which includes one additional song, and some extra animation), Pocahontas feels far too long. Simply put, Pocahontas is a bit of a bore. Most of the time, I was just waiting for the next song to start, as they represented the only interesting parts of the film. Attempts at humor are few. Successful humor is even more rare. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story was more interesting, or the characters more unique. And yet, we have clich&eacute;d stereotypes, or even worse; completely personality-less individuals that seem to have little purpose in the film. Pocahontas is free-spirited and adventurous; in other words, she is completely indistinguishable with almost any of Disney's other princesses. John Smith has no personality, period. And Governor Radcliffe is the traditional evil villain, who has a distinctly and curiously lazy-feeling motive for his villainy. The musical numbers are superb, though. While not as catchy or as magical as the best Disney songs of this era, Pocahontas still boasts it's share of enjoyable songs. "The Virginia March" is a delightfully retro Disney song. It would've felt right at home in some of Disney's oldest films. "Just Around the Riverbend" is a lively and joyous number, while "Mine, Mine, Mine" has a wonderfully grand finish, and fun lyrics. "Colors of the Wind" is possibly the best song in the film, with great music, beautiful lyrics, and the best visuals in the film. The only song in the film I didn't enjoy was "If I Never Knew You." This number was specifically added for the 10th anniversary edition, and it's formulaic, dull, and instantly forgettable. The cast is weak. Irene Bedard and Mel Gibson provide generic and colorless voices for Pocahontas and John Smith respectively. Russel Means and James Fall were noticeably poor as key characters in Pocahontas' tribe. Only David Odgen Stiers (portraying Governor Radcliffe, and his servant Wiggins) shows any kind of energy in his performance. The animation is breath taking, not that I would expect anything less from Disney. There's one scene at the end where Pocahontas is racing to her village to stop a potential war that's simply stunning. If nothing else, Disney has not slouched in their animation department when making Pocahontas. The score by Alan Menken is predictably great. Applying the excellent themes from the various songs into the score, Menken has composed another success. It's beautifully written, and often outshines the events on screen. Not funny, not interesting, and terribly dull, Pocahontas is one of Disney's weaker films. While the songs are great, and the animation is gorgeous, Pocahontas can't capture the magic of other Disney films of the Disney Renaissance Era. The wonderful songs may stick in my memory, but the scenes inbetween are already being forgotten.

    Most of the animation movies are about immature girl falling in love with a stranger from another place and then leaving with the crush into his own world. Although that's where the movies end, i am always curious about what would happen after the movie!! This is where i found the ending of the movie very good. it showed, she has character, leadership, strength and is caring for her people. Another aspect I liked was how she sneaked out, and he sneaked out, and both tried to keep it secret, it makes it more realistic. Also I liked the honesty in the movie, how even a sincere guy thinks the natives are savages, uncivilized, and how the captain came for gold, greed and land, and who wanted to wipe out the "race". Although in reality that is exactly what happened, in the movie, things turned out better. At least it made me believe and hope that may be something like this actually happened, somewhere in the world. Remember British did not just come to America, they did colonize practically the whole world. And overall the lesson is good, just because we are different does not mean the others are savages, or inhuman. Just because a group has more technology, does not make them civilized either. And there is more to life, nature, spirituality, the 4th dimension, than just materials and wealth. And "sometimes the right thing to do is not always the easiest one". Its a good watch, but its definitely not for children, its more for thinking adults!

    Pocahontas is an amazing movie. I honestly don't think I'd be who I am today with out it. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. The animation's beautiful, the songs are to die for, and the story is great. Yes, it doesn't follow the true story, but that wouldn't really make a good kid's movie, would it? It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism. The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like "you will not hurt me"). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song "Colors of the Wind", my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by "Drums of War." I won't give away any more. But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes? Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing. I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well. This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a "kid's movie". I know I'll be showing my kids when I'm older!!!

    when i saw this movie the first time, i found it beautiful, it has been my favorite movie through all this years, it's just beautiful, i cant get it how the hell it is rated with 6.3 stars. because she is the most beautiful and the bravest girl of all time! i haven't seen this for a long long time, and i can tell you for sure that this is one of the best animations of all time, because this is full of teachings, a true love tale, and above all they leave us with a big expectation of what happens next, because, you see, it doesn't matter if there is a sequel, for me Pocahontas 2 is like it has never existed, because every time we see this movie we will think of how great the human spirit can be, how great this movie makes us feel. and i know that you may not understand or agree with all I'm saying but, this is from the bottom of my childish heart, and no matter what happens ever, i will let my intern child live, and my children, if someday i have some, they will certainly see this good all classics.

    I'll be honest, Pocahontas is the Disney movie of the 90's that appeals to me the least. For nearly a year, I've heard some negative statements about the movie from a couple of the teachers at my high school (they both teach history, keep in mind). In the past, Disney has been known for their adaptations of classic literature... but a historical figure was obviously not the best choice for their next movie after the immense success of The Lion King, and it shows. While the artwork is good, the music is good and such, the story is very weak and predictable. Note that this sort of plot has been used by various movies, including Avatar and Dances with Wolves. And on top of that, this film is a grossly inaccurate representation of Native American history, with the conflict between the British and Natives toned down to be little more than a simple fight between two sides that almost never happens thanks to Pocahontas saving John Smith. However, I do give the movie credit for casting First Nations actors to voice the Natives, such as the late Russell Means as Chief Powhatan and Gordon Tootoosis as Kekata. Sure the backgrounds and character designs for the humans are realistic and look great, but the story is also important for an animated movie, and in the case of a movie based on history or culture, historical and cultural accuracy. Fortunately, the film has a good message, "Everyone is different and people are people no matter how they look", but Disney has not always been good at teaching that to children, like The Fox and the Hound, which had a good message but in this case, it was not clear on target audience. On top of that, there should be better ways to teach children that it's OK to be different. So really, I don't know whether to recommend it or not. Maybe it would be best to watch it with children and explain some things about it later so that children aren't mislead by this movie.

    Pocahontas (1995) *** (out of 4) Disney's version of the relationship between Englishman John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson) and Pocahontas (voice of). This here was the studio's 33rd film and while it's far from a classic, overall the animation is good enough to make it worth sitting through.

People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes? Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing. I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well. This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a "kid's movie". I know I'll be showing my kids when I'm older!!!

    when i saw this movie the first time, i found it beautiful, it has been my favorite movie through all this years, it's just beautiful, i cant get it how the hell it is rated with 6.3 stars. because she is the most beautiful and the bravest girl of all time! i haven't seen this for a long long time, and i can tell you for sure that this is one of the best animations of all time, because this is full of teachings, a true love tale, and above all they leave us with a big expectation of what happens next, because, you see, it doesn't matter if there is a sequel, for me Pocahontas 2 is like it has never existed, because every time we see this movie we will think of how great the human spirit can be, how great this movie makes us feel. and i know that you may not understand or agree with all I'm saying but, this is from the bottom of my childish heart, and no matter what happens ever, i will let my intern child live, and my children, if someday i have some, they will certainly see this good all classics.

    I'll be honest, Pocahontas is the Disney movie of the 90's that appeals to me the least. For nearly a year, I've heard some negative statements about the movie from a couple of the teachers at my high school (they both teach history, keep in mind). In the past, Disney has been known for their adaptations of classic literature... but a historical figure was obviously not the best choice for their next movie after the immense success of The Lion King, and it shows. While the artwork is good, the music is good and such, the story is very weak and predictable. Note that this sort of plot has been used by various movies, including Avatar and Dances with Wolves. And on top of that, this film is a grossly inaccurate representation of Native American history, with the conflict between the British and Natives toned down to be little more than a simple fight between two sides that almost never happens thanks to Pocahontas saving John Smith. However, I do give the movie credit for casting First Nations actors to voice the Natives, such as the late Russell Means as Chief Powhatan and Gordon Tootoosis as Kekata. Sure the backgrounds and character designs for the humans are realistic and look great, but the story is also important for an animated movie, and in the case of a movie based on history or culture, historical and cultural accuracy. Fortunately, the film has a good message, "Everyone is different and people are people no matter how they look", but Disney has not always been good at teaching that to children, like The Fox and the Hound, which had a good message but in this case, it was not clear on target audience. On top of that, there should be better ways to teach children that it's OK to be different. So really, I don't know whether to recommend it or not. Maybe it would be best to watch it with children and explain some things about it later so that children aren't mislead by this movie.

    Pocahontas (1995) *** (out of 4) Disney's version of the relationship between Englishman John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson) and Pocahontas (voice of). This here was the studio's 33rd film and while it's far from a classic, overall the animation is good enough to make it worth sitting through. It should go without saying but history buffs might want to stay away from this but then again, this here is a Disney movie so I'm not sure why people should come into this wanting a documentary. I remember when the film was released there was a lot of promotional material about how respectful the film was going to be towards Native Americans and for the most part I think this is very true. I thought the film did a pretty good job at showing the good quality of both sides and the film managed to give enough of the history to where young kids should be able to enjoy the film as entertainment as well as get a fair idea of what happened during this period. I think what works best about the film is the animation, which shows the studio at the top of their game. I really loved the dim blue colors that highlight the majority of the film and especially the scenes inside the woods. The beautiful red skies is another major plus and there's no question that the characters all look extremely good and well-drawn. I thought Gibson did a very good job with his vocal work but the rest of the actors are fine as well. The animal creatures are another plus with the raccoon certainly being the standout. I think there are some major flaws here including every single song. There really wasn't a single one that impressed me and this is somewhat of a shock considering the hot streak that the studio was on. POCAHONTAS isn't classic Disney but fans of the company should at least be entertained by it.

    I absolutely adore this movie. It's amazing and I am so pleased that I watched this movie. The thing that really opened my eyes was the fact that it's a true story although Disney added their own bits and pieces and of course the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. I try to forget that the second movie ever existed, I was so sad and disappointed when Pocahontas didn't leave with John but it also gave it a bittersweet ending and of course, fanfiction which I love. This movie deserves to be in the top 5 of Disney's greatest masterpieces. Instead of the typical happy lovey dovey ending, we're given a settling outburst of emotion, joy and love. Recommended for all ages.

    I really loved the music and how it moved... the orchestrations were very smart and at moments complex (polyphony) and the lyrics really contributed to the story's very serious undertone. The portrayal of Native Americans in the media has always been (and justly so) a sensitive subject but I am happy to report that it appears this movie has done it with great taste and respect for the culture. The animation is great and certain sequences (most notably "Colors of the Wind" are just masterful. I could actually feel the wind at the end! A great watch! An important film... not a popcorn Disney (like some recent ones) Bravo!

    After one viewing, I am not sure what I think about the story of this movie. It doesn't feel like a typical children's movie, although I watched it with a group of 5 year-olds, and it totally kept them interested (the rating should probably be PG because of the violence--one character is shot to death pretty prominently). I thought in terms of subject matter, things were handled well. My feeling on presenting history inaccurately is that you shouldn't be expecting Disney movies to be faithful to anything other than marketability. Where the movie surprised me is how amazing it was visually. You can tell that's where the work really went into, and the time spent developing the look of the characters totally paid off. I'll watch this one again.

    I recently just watched this movie and was shocked how great this movie really is. I'm surprised how negative everyone is about the historical accuracy. It's a Disney movie, an animated children's movie. Of course, it's not suppose to accurate. The point of the movie is to deliver a message to children, not to teach 6, 7, 8 year olds historical facts. Yes this movie is "hollywood-ized" but like I said it's a Disney film whose purpose is to entertain not to inform. It delivers a beautiful message especially with the song savages. Both sides sing the same song to show how similar they are. They had this message earlier with the song, "Colors of the Wind". Also, it teaches children to follow their hearts and not follow the crowd/mob mentality. If you're really judging this movie solely on historical accuracy, that is just plain dumb. I mean seriously, are you really trying to teach your kids history through a Disney movie.

    Underwhelming. That was my first thought after finishing Pocahontas. Granted, my expectations may have been a bit high, but this IS renaissance Disney after all. Frankly, Pocahontas is not one of Disney's greats, or even one of their goods. It's a mediocre film with some marvelous musical numbers placed between uninteresting filler. Loosely based off of the real story of Pocahontas, this romance is formula, formula, formula. Pocahontas is forced to marry an unwanted suitor. She falls in love with a forbidden man. In this case, that man is John Smith. John Smith, being European, and known for killing savages, is of course, initially opposed by the tribe Pocahontas comes from. But John Smith comes to understand the Indians as intelligent and resourceful people, though the villainous Governor Radcliffe is less easily convinced. Even at a lean run time of 84 minutes (I viewed the 10th anniversary version which includes one additional song, and some extra animation), Pocahontas feels far too long. Simply put, Pocahontas is a bit of a bore. Most of the time, I was just waiting for the next song to start, as they represented the only interesting parts of the film. Attempts at humor are few. Successful humor is even more rare. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story was more interesting, or the characters more unique. And yet, we have clich&eacute;d stereotypes, or even worse; completely personality-less individuals that seem to have little purpose in the film. Pocahontas is free-spirited and adventurous; in other words, she is completely indistinguishable with almost any of Disney's other princesses. John Smith has no personality, period. And Governor Radcliffe is the traditional evil villain, who has a distinctly and curiously lazy-feeling motive for his villainy. The musical numbers are superb, though. While not as catchy or as magical as the best Disney songs of this era, Pocahontas still boasts it's share of enjoyable songs. "The Virginia March" is a delightfully retro Disney song. It would've felt right at home in some of Disney's oldest films. "Just Around the Riverbend" is a lively and joyous number, while "Mine, Mine, Mine" has a wonderfully grand finish, and fun lyrics. "Colors of the Wind" is possibly the best song in the film, with great music, beautiful lyrics, and the best visuals in the film. The only song in the film I didn't enjoy was "If I Never Knew You." This number was specifically added for the 10th anniversary edition, and it's formulaic, dull, and instantly forgettable. The cast is weak. Irene Bedard and Mel Gibson provide generic and colorless voices for Pocahontas and John Smith respectively. Russel Means and James Fall were noticeably poor as key characters in Pocahontas' tribe. Only David Odgen Stiers (portraying Governor Radcliffe, and his servant Wiggins) shows any kind of energy in his performance. The animation is breath taking, not that I would expect anything less from Disney. There's one scene at the end where Pocahontas is racing to her village to stop a potential war that's simply stunning. If nothing else, Disney has not slouched in their animation department when making Pocahontas. The score by Alan Menken is predictably great. Applying the excellent themes from the various songs into the score, Menken has composed another success. It's beautifully written, and often outshines the events on screen. Not funny, not interesting, and terribly dull, Pocahontas is one of Disney's weaker films. While the songs are great, and the animation is gorgeous, Pocahontas can't capture the magic of other Disney films of the Disney Renaissance Era. The wonderful songs may stick in my memory, but the scenes inbetween are already being forgotten.

    Most of the animation movies are about immature girl falling in love with a stranger from another place and then leaving with the crush into his own world. Although that's where the movies end, i am always curious about what would happen after the movie!! This is where i found the ending of the movie very good. it showed, she has character, leadership, strength and is caring for her people. Another aspect I liked was how she sneaked out, and he sneaked out, and both tried to keep it secret, it makes it more realistic. Also I liked the honesty in the movie, how even a sincere guy thinks the natives are savages, uncivilized, and how the captain came for gold, greed and land, and who wanted to wipe out the "race". Although in reality that is exactly what happened, in the movie, things turned out better. At least it made me believe and hope that may be something like this actually happened, somewhere in the world. Remember British did not just come to America, they did colonize practically the whole world. And overall the lesson is good, just because we are different does not mean the others are savages, or inhuman. Just because a group has more technology, does not make them civilized either. And there is more to life, nature, spirituality, the 4th dimension, than just materials and wealth. And "sometimes the right thing to do is not always the easiest one". Its a good watch, but its definitely not for children, its more for thinking adults!

    Pocahontas is an amazing movie. I honestly don't think I'd be who I am today with out it. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. The animation's beautiful, the songs are to die for, and the story is great. Yes, it doesn't follow the true story, but that wouldn't really make a good kid's movie, would it? It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism. The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like "you will not hurt me"). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song "Colors of the Wind", my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by "Drums of War." I won't give away any more. But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something.

Successful humor is even more rare. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story was more interesting, or the characters more unique. And yet, we have clich&eacute;d stereotypes, or even worse; completely personality-less individuals that seem to have little purpose in the film. Pocahontas is free-spirited and adventurous; in other words, she is completely indistinguishable with almost any of Disney's other princesses. John Smith has no personality, period. And Governor Radcliffe is the traditional evil villain, who has a distinctly and curiously lazy-feeling motive for his villainy. The musical numbers are superb, though. While not as catchy or as magical as the best Disney songs of this era, Pocahontas still boasts it's share of enjoyable songs. "The Virginia March" is a delightfully retro Disney song. It would've felt right at home in some of Disney's oldest films. "Just Around the Riverbend" is a lively and joyous number, while "Mine, Mine, Mine" has a wonderfully grand finish, and fun lyrics. "Colors of the Wind" is possibly the best song in the film, with great music, beautiful lyrics, and the best visuals in the film. The only song in the film I didn't enjoy was "If I Never Knew You." This number was specifically added for the 10th anniversary edition, and it's formulaic, dull, and instantly forgettable. The cast is weak. Irene Bedard and Mel Gibson provide generic and colorless voices for Pocahontas and John Smith respectively. Russel Means and James Fall were noticeably poor as key characters in Pocahontas' tribe. Only David Odgen Stiers (portraying Governor Radcliffe, and his servant Wiggins) shows any kind of energy in his performance. The animation is breath taking, not that I would expect anything less from Disney. There's one scene at the end where Pocahontas is racing to her village to stop a potential war that's simply stunning. If nothing else, Disney has not slouched in their animation department when making Pocahontas. The score by Alan Menken is predictably great. Applying the excellent themes from the various songs into the score, Menken has composed another success. It's beautifully written, and often outshines the events on screen. Not funny, not interesting, and terribly dull, Pocahontas is one of Disney's weaker films. While the songs are great, and the animation is gorgeous, Pocahontas can't capture the magic of other Disney films of the Disney Renaissance Era. The wonderful songs may stick in my memory, but the scenes inbetween are already being forgotten.

    Most of the animation movies are about immature girl falling in love with a stranger from another place and then leaving with the crush into his own world. Although that's where the movies end, i am always curious about what would happen after the movie!! This is where i found the ending of the movie very good. it showed, she has character, leadership, strength and is caring for her people. Another aspect I liked was how she sneaked out, and he sneaked out, and both tried to keep it secret, it makes it more realistic. Also I liked the honesty in the movie, how even a sincere guy thinks the natives are savages, uncivilized, and how the captain came for gold, greed and land, and who wanted to wipe out the "race". Although in reality that is exactly what happened, in the movie, things turned out better. At least it made me believe and hope that may be something like this actually happened, somewhere in the world. Remember British did not just come to America, they did colonize practically the whole world. And overall the lesson is good, just because we are different does not mean the others are savages, or inhuman. Just because a group has more technology, does not make them civilized either. And there is more to life, nature, spirituality, the 4th dimension, than just materials and wealth. And "sometimes the right thing to do is not always the easiest one". Its a good watch, but its definitely not for children, its more for thinking adults!

    Pocahontas is an amazing movie. I honestly don't think I'd be who I am today with out it. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. The animation's beautiful, the songs are to die for, and the story is great. Yes, it doesn't follow the true story, but that wouldn't really make a good kid's movie, would it? It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism. The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like "you will not hurt me"). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song "Colors of the Wind", my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by "Drums of War." I won't give away any more. But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes? Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing. I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well. This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a "kid's movie". I know I'll be showing my kids when I'm older!!!

    when i saw this movie the first time, i found it beautiful, it has been my favorite movie through all this years, it's just beautiful, i cant get it how the hell it is rated with 6.3 stars. because she is the most beautiful and the bravest girl of all time! i haven't seen this for a long long time, and i can tell you for sure that this is one of the best animations of all time, because this is full of teachings, a true love tale, and above all they leave us with a big expectation of what happens next, because, you see, it doesn't matter if there is a sequel, for me Pocahontas 2 is like it has never existed, because every time we see this movie we will think of how great the human spirit can be, how great this movie makes us feel. and i know that you may not understand or agree with all I'm saying but, this is from the bottom of my childish heart, and no matter what happens ever, i will let my intern child live, and my children, if someday i have some, they will certainly see this good all classics.

    I'll be honest, Pocahontas is the Disney movie of the 90's that appeals to me the least. For nearly a year, I've heard some negative statements about the movie from a couple of the teachers at my high school (they both teach history, keep in mind). In the past, Disney has been known for their adaptations of classic literature... but a historical figure was obviously not the best choice for their next movie after the immense success of The Lion King, and it shows. While the artwork is good, the music is good and such, the story is very weak and predictable. Note that this sort of plot has been used by various movies, including Avatar and Dances with Wolves. And on top of that, this film is a grossly inaccurate representation of Native American history, with the conflict between the British and Natives toned down to be little more than a simple fight between two sides that almost never happens thanks to Pocahontas saving John Smith. However, I do give the movie credit for casting First Nations actors to voice the Natives, such as the late Russell Means as Chief Powhatan and Gordon Tootoosis as Kekata. Sure the backgrounds and character designs for the humans are realistic and look great, but the story is also important for an animated movie, and in the case of a movie based on history or culture, historical and cultural accuracy. Fortunately, the film has a good message, "Everyone is different and people are people no matter how they look", but Disney has not always been good at teaching that to children, like The Fox and the Hound, which had a good message but in this case, it was not clear on target audience. On top of that, there should be better ways to teach children that it's OK to be different. So really, I don't know whether to recommend it or not. Maybe it would be best to watch it with children and explain some things about it later so that children aren't mislead by this movie.

    Pocahontas (1995) *** (out of 4) Disney's version of the relationship between Englishman John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson) and Pocahontas (voice of). This here was the studio's 33rd film and while it's far from a classic, overall the animation is good enough to make it worth sitting through. It should go without saying but history buffs might want to stay away from this but then again, this here is a Disney movie so I'm not sure why people should come into this wanting a documentary. I remember when the film was released there was a lot of promotional material about how respectful the film was going to be towards Native Americans and for the most part I think this is very true. I thought the film did a pretty good job at showing the good quality of both sides and the film managed to give enough of the history to where young kids should be able to enjoy the film as entertainment as well as get a fair idea of what happened during this period. I think what works best about the film is the animation, which shows the studio at the top of their game. I really loved the dim blue colors that highlight the majority of the film and especially the scenes inside the woods. The beautiful red skies is another major plus and there's no question that the characters all look extremely good and well-drawn. I thought Gibson did a very good job with his vocal work but the rest of the actors are fine as well. The animal creatures are another plus with the raccoon certainly being the standout. I think there are some major flaws here including every single song. There really wasn't a single one that impressed me and this is somewhat of a shock considering the hot streak that the studio was on. POCAHONTAS isn't classic Disney but fans of the company should at least be entertained by it.

    I absolutely adore this movie. It's amazing and I am so pleased that I watched this movie. The thing that really opened my eyes was the fact that it's a true story although Disney added their own bits and pieces and of course the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. I try to forget that the second movie ever existed, I was so sad and disappointed when Pocahontas didn't leave with John but it also gave it a bittersweet ending and of course, fanfiction which I love. This movie deserves to be in the top 5 of Disney's greatest masterpieces. Instead of the typical happy lovey dovey ending, we're given a settling outburst of emotion, joy and love. Recommended for all ages.

    I really loved the music and how it moved... the orchestrations were very smart and at moments complex (polyphony) and the lyrics really contributed to the story's very serious undertone. The portrayal of Native Americans in the media has always been (and justly so) a sensitive subject but I am happy to report that it appears this movie has done it with great taste and respect for the culture. The animation is great and certain sequences (most notably "Colors of the Wind" are just masterful. I could actually feel the wind at the end! A great watch! An important film... not a popcorn Disney (like some recent ones) Bravo!

    After one viewing, I am not sure what I think about the story of this movie. It doesn't feel like a typical children's movie, although I watched it with a group of 5 year-olds, and it totally kept them interested (the rating should probably be PG because of the violence--one character is shot to death pretty prominently). I thought in terms of subject matter, things were handled well. My feeling on presenting history inaccurately is that you shouldn't be expecting Disney movies to be faithful to anything other than marketability. Where the movie surprised me is how amazing it was visually. You can tell that's where the work really went into, and the time spent developing the look of the characters totally paid off. I'll watch this one again.

    I recently just watched this movie and was shocked how great this movie really is. I'm surprised how negative everyone is about the historical accuracy. It's a Disney movie, an animated children's movie. Of course, it's not suppose to accurate. The point of the movie is to deliver a message to children, not to teach 6, 7, 8 year olds historical facts. Yes this movie is "hollywood-ized" but like I said it's a Disney film whose purpose is to entertain not to inform. It delivers a beautiful message especially with the song savages. Both sides sing the same song to show how similar they are. They had this message earlier with the song, "Colors of the Wind". Also, it teaches children to follow their hearts and not follow the crowd/mob mentality. If you're really judging this movie solely on historical accuracy, that is just plain dumb. I mean seriously, are you really trying to teach your kids history through a Disney movie.

    Underwhelming. That was my first thought after finishing Pocahontas. Granted, my expectations may have been a bit high, but this IS renaissance Disney after all. Frankly, Pocahontas is not one of Disney's greats, or even one of their goods. It's a mediocre film with some marvelous musical numbers placed between uninteresting filler. Loosely based off of the real story of Pocahontas, this romance is formula, formula, formula. Pocahontas is forced to marry an unwanted suitor. She falls in love with a forbidden man. In this case, that man is John Smith. John Smith, being European, and known for killing savages, is of course, initially opposed by the tribe Pocahontas comes from. But John Smith comes to understand the Indians as intelligent and resourceful people, though the villainous Governor Radcliffe is less easily convinced. Even at a lean run time of 84 minutes (I viewed the 10th anniversary version which includes one additional song, and some extra animation), Pocahontas feels far too long. Simply put, Pocahontas is a bit of a bore. Most of the time, I was just waiting for the next song to start, as they represented the only interesting parts of the film. Attempts at humor are few. Successful humor is even more rare. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story was more interesting, or the characters more unique.

There really wasn't a single one that impressed me and this is somewhat of a shock considering the hot streak that the studio was on. POCAHONTAS isn't classic Disney but fans of the company should at least be entertained by it.
