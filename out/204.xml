    Robert Zemekis directed this hugely entertaining Time-travel adventure comedy as Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back in time 30 years in a De Leorean converted Time machine invented by his eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Once in 1955, he accidentally intervenes in how his parents met, resulting in him being threatened from temporal erasure! He enlists the aid of the younger Dr. Brown, to help him put things right, and get back to his future... A fine cast, witty and inventive script, and inspired direction make this a most entertaining adventure, very exciting and funny, and filled with charm, and good-natured humor about the differences in culture that 30 years can bring.

    I first watched this film when I was young, it having been recommended to me by my mother, and it remains a favourite still today. The storyline is, of course, a favourite to many, and I just loved it. The idea of time travel and the 'butterfly effect' is portrayed extremely well throughout the film, and Marty's difficulties sticking to the rules of time travel (not helped by certain characters he encounters) never fails to entertain me. The links between the people he meets in 1955 and the people in his life in 1985 are shown so well, and the comedy about the differences in technology always makes me laugh. The film was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger, as well as later on in my life.

    Back to the Future is a movie about high schooler Marty McFly who has befriended a scientist who has a discovery worth a look. Doctor Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at the mall, where he reveals a Delorean... made for time travel. The Delorean is the vessel for Marty's adventures in this very well put together trilogy. In the first movie, Marty goes back to 1955, the year his parents met. Marty tries to get back home, but the Delorean won't start, so he has to live in 1955 for a while. In 1955, Marty finds Emmett Brown, and has to convince him that he helped him travel back in time 30 years later. Emmett is Marty's only hope in getting back to 1985, but Marty's being there in 1955 has changed a few things; so even if he does get back to the future, things could be different. Can Marty get everything back to normal and get back to 1985? Find out! Once you watch the first one, you'll HAVE to watch parts II and III.

    Maybe the most rewatchable movie there is, "Back to the Future" is great family-fun and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox) is a teenager living in the 80's who's accidentally sent back in time to the 50's and after complicating his mother and father's soon to be relationship he must find a way to re-unite them for his own existence depends on it. If only for the skateboard scene only, this movie provides some of the funnest scenes you will ever find. The performances are very energetic and are hard to take your eyes off. It's a 116 min roller coaster ride you'll want to get on again once it ends. By the way here's an astonishing story I found online (I'm not sure whether it's true or not): ------------------------------------------------------------ I worked at Amblin' in the 80's when all this went down, and here is what really happened. Bob Zemeckis was given a firm start date by Universal. This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz. Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule. To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things. I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart. However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place. Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage? Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy." ------------------------------------------------------------ Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch. I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked "Star Wars", "Groundhog Day", "Looper", "Wall-e", or "Jurassic Park".

    Marty McFly (Fox) is the average American kid who loves skate- boarding, chasing girls and getting late to school. His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clich&eacute;d, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch.

    You can't beat this film. Marty McFly goes back in time, in a DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. The movie, in fact, resembles Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" more than other, conventional time-travel movies. It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it. Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother "has the hots" for him. The movie's surprises are one of its great pleasures. Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.

    This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read "IT" by Stephen King or watch "Twin Peaks" by David Lynch for examples The next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom. The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !

    Where do I even start with "Back to the Future?" Director Robert Zemeckis has been known for sensational movies such as "Cast Away," and "Forrest Gump." But "Back to the Future," is by far my favorite of Zemeckis's movies. "Back to the Future," is about a man named Dr.Emmitt Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. When Dr. Brown makes a time machine out of a 1981 DMC DeLorean, Marty accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past. When he meets his teenage mother, to Marty's disbelief, he notices that she is more interested in him other than his father. Marty now must plan out an event with his teenage father that he believes will unite them and his existence will then be saved. The overall feeling of this film is quite exhilarating, there is some action, some romance, and quite a bit of nostalgia that I think is essential in all great movies. Not to mention some memorable quotes such as "Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that you made a time machine... out of a DeLorean?" and "Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads." Overall, "Back to the Future," is an instant classic and it has potential to be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages.

    With one Academy Award and a place in IMDb's Top 250 greatest movies of all time, Back to the Future has one on the best movies of the 1980s. Popular with the younger generation because of how it's about the younger generation and also popular with older people because of many reasons. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are the stars of this movie about an 18 year old boy who has mostly everything going for him. a hot girlfriend, talented musician but not brilliant in his school life with a certain teacher who has a dislike for him because of his family who went to that school before. Until his friend the brilliant, but a bit mental scientist Dr. Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at 1am to show him his latest invention, A time-machine, but something goes wrong and it results in Marty ending up 30 years earlier in 1955. His only hope of getting back to the future is to get help from a younger Dr. Emmett Brown. While in 1955 he runs into the younger version of his parents and makes a mistake which could erase his own existence. It's a bit of a confusing storyline which still confuses people to this day. But that is just good writing. Written and Directed by Robert Zemecks and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg. It won an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for three others, with a rating of 8.5/10 puts itself at number 45 in the Top 250 and is critically acclaimed as one of the best movies of the 80s this movie is my 2nd of all time favorite and without a doubt one of the best movies ever made.

    Where do I even start with "Back to the Future?" Director Robert Zemeckis has been known for sensational movies such as "Cast Away," and "Forrest Gump." But "Back to the Future," is by far my favorite of Zemeckis's movies. "Back to the Future," is about a man named Dr.Emmitt Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. When Dr. Brown makes a time machine out of a 1981 DMC DeLorean, Marty accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past. When he meets his teenage mother, to Marty's disbelief, he notices that she is more interested in him other than his father. Marty now must plan out an event with his teenage father that he believes will unite them and his existence will then be saved. The overall feeling of this film is quite exhilarating, there is some action, some romance, and quite a bit of nostalgia that I think is essential in all great movies. Not to mention some memorable quotes such as "Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that you made a time machine... out of a DeLorean?" and "Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads." Overall, "Back to the Future," is an instant classic and it has potential to be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages.

    With one Academy Award and a place in IMDb's Top 250 greatest movies of all time, Back to the Future has one on the best movies of the 1980s. Popular with the younger generation because of how it's about the younger generation and also popular with older people because of many reasons. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are the stars of this movie about an 18 year old boy who has mostly everything going for him. a hot girlfriend, talented musician but not brilliant in his school life with a certain teacher who has a dislike for him because of his family who went to that school before. Until his friend the brilliant, but a bit mental scientist Dr. Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at 1am to show him his latest invention, A time-machine, but something goes wrong and it results in Marty ending up 30 years earlier in 1955. His only hope of getting back to the future is to get help from a younger Dr. Emmett Brown. While in 1955 he runs into the younger version of his parents and makes a mistake which could erase his own existence. It's a bit of a confusing storyline which still confuses people to this day. But that is just good writing. Written and Directed by Robert Zemecks and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg. It won an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for three others, with a rating of 8.5/10 puts itself at number 45 in the Top 250 and is critically acclaimed as one of the best movies of the 80s this movie is my 2nd of all time favorite and without a doubt one of the best movies ever made.

    Robert Zemekis directed this hugely entertaining Time-travel adventure comedy as Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back in time 30 years in a De Leorean converted Time machine invented by his eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Once in 1955, he accidentally intervenes in how his parents met, resulting in him being threatened from temporal erasure! He enlists the aid of the younger Dr. Brown, to help him put things right, and get back to his future... A fine cast, witty and inventive script, and inspired direction make this a most entertaining adventure, very exciting and funny, and filled with charm, and good-natured humor about the differences in culture that 30 years can bring.

    I first watched this film when I was young, it having been recommended to me by my mother, and it remains a favourite still today. The storyline is, of course, a favourite to many, and I just loved it. The idea of time travel and the 'butterfly effect' is portrayed extremely well throughout the film, and Marty's difficulties sticking to the rules of time travel (not helped by certain characters he encounters) never fails to entertain me. The links between the people he meets in 1955 and the people in his life in 1985 are shown so well, and the comedy about the differences in technology always makes me laugh. The film was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger, as well as later on in my life.

    Back to the Future is a movie about high schooler Marty McFly who has befriended a scientist who has a discovery worth a look. Doctor Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at the mall, where he reveals a Delorean... made for time travel. The Delorean is the vessel for Marty's adventures in this very well put together trilogy. In the first movie, Marty goes back to 1955, the year his parents met. Marty tries to get back home, but the Delorean won't start, so he has to live in 1955 for a while. In 1955, Marty finds Emmett Brown, and has to convince him that he helped him travel back in time 30 years later. Emmett is Marty's only hope in getting back to 1985, but Marty's being there in 1955 has changed a few things; so even if he does get back to the future, things could be different. Can Marty get everything back to normal and get back to 1985? Find out! Once you watch the first one, you'll HAVE to watch parts II and III.

    Maybe the most rewatchable movie there is, "Back to the Future" is great family-fun and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox) is a teenager living in the 80's who's accidentally sent back in time to the 50's and after complicating his mother and father's soon to be relationship he must find a way to re-unite them for his own existence depends on it. If only for the skateboard scene only, this movie provides some of the funnest scenes you will ever find. The performances are very energetic and are hard to take your eyes off. It's a 116 min roller coaster ride you'll want to get on again once it ends. By the way here's an astonishing story I found online (I'm not sure whether it's true or not): ------------------------------------------------------------ I worked at Amblin' in the 80's when all this went down, and here is what really happened. Bob Zemeckis was given a firm start date by Universal. This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz. Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule. To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things. I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart. However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place. Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage? Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy." ------------------------------------------------------------ Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch. I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked "Star Wars", "Groundhog Day", "Looper", "Wall-e", or "Jurassic Park".

    Marty McFly (Fox) is the average American kid who loves skate- boarding, chasing girls and getting late to school. His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clich&eacute;d, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch.

    You can't beat this film. Marty McFly goes back in time, in a DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. The movie, in fact, resembles Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" more than other, conventional time-travel movies. It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it. Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother "has the hots" for him. The movie's surprises are one of its great pleasures. Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.

    This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read "IT" by Stephen King or watch "Twin Peaks" by David Lynch for examples The next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom. The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !

Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom. The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !

    Where do I even start with "Back to the Future?" Director Robert Zemeckis has been known for sensational movies such as "Cast Away," and "Forrest Gump." But "Back to the Future," is by far my favorite of Zemeckis's movies. "Back to the Future," is about a man named Dr.Emmitt Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. When Dr. Brown makes a time machine out of a 1981 DMC DeLorean, Marty accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past. When he meets his teenage mother, to Marty's disbelief, he notices that she is more interested in him other than his father. Marty now must plan out an event with his teenage father that he believes will unite them and his existence will then be saved. The overall feeling of this film is quite exhilarating, there is some action, some romance, and quite a bit of nostalgia that I think is essential in all great movies. Not to mention some memorable quotes such as "Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that you made a time machine... out of a DeLorean?" and "Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads." Overall, "Back to the Future," is an instant classic and it has potential to be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages.

    With one Academy Award and a place in IMDb's Top 250 greatest movies of all time, Back to the Future has one on the best movies of the 1980s. Popular with the younger generation because of how it's about the younger generation and also popular with older people because of many reasons. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are the stars of this movie about an 18 year old boy who has mostly everything going for him. a hot girlfriend, talented musician but not brilliant in his school life with a certain teacher who has a dislike for him because of his family who went to that school before. Until his friend the brilliant, but a bit mental scientist Dr. Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at 1am to show him his latest invention, A time-machine, but something goes wrong and it results in Marty ending up 30 years earlier in 1955. His only hope of getting back to the future is to get help from a younger Dr. Emmett Brown. While in 1955 he runs into the younger version of his parents and makes a mistake which could erase his own existence. It's a bit of a confusing storyline which still confuses people to this day. But that is just good writing. Written and Directed by Robert Zemecks and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg. It won an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for three others, with a rating of 8.5/10 puts itself at number 45 in the Top 250 and is critically acclaimed as one of the best movies of the 80s this movie is my 2nd of all time favorite and without a doubt one of the best movies ever made.

    Robert Zemekis directed this hugely entertaining Time-travel adventure comedy as Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back in time 30 years in a De Leorean converted Time machine invented by his eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Once in 1955, he accidentally intervenes in how his parents met, resulting in him being threatened from temporal erasure! He enlists the aid of the younger Dr. Brown, to help him put things right, and get back to his future... A fine cast, witty and inventive script, and inspired direction make this a most entertaining adventure, very exciting and funny, and filled with charm, and good-natured humor about the differences in culture that 30 years can bring.

    I first watched this film when I was young, it having been recommended to me by my mother, and it remains a favourite still today. The storyline is, of course, a favourite to many, and I just loved it. The idea of time travel and the 'butterfly effect' is portrayed extremely well throughout the film, and Marty's difficulties sticking to the rules of time travel (not helped by certain characters he encounters) never fails to entertain me. The links between the people he meets in 1955 and the people in his life in 1985 are shown so well, and the comedy about the differences in technology always makes me laugh. The film was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger, as well as later on in my life.

    Back to the Future is a movie about high schooler Marty McFly who has befriended a scientist who has a discovery worth a look. Doctor Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at the mall, where he reveals a Delorean... made for time travel. The Delorean is the vessel for Marty's adventures in this very well put together trilogy. In the first movie, Marty goes back to 1955, the year his parents met. Marty tries to get back home, but the Delorean won't start, so he has to live in 1955 for a while. In 1955, Marty finds Emmett Brown, and has to convince him that he helped him travel back in time 30 years later. Emmett is Marty's only hope in getting back to 1985, but Marty's being there in 1955 has changed a few things; so even if he does get back to the future, things could be different. Can Marty get everything back to normal and get back to 1985? Find out! Once you watch the first one, you'll HAVE to watch parts II and III.

    Maybe the most rewatchable movie there is, "Back to the Future" is great family-fun and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox) is a teenager living in the 80's who's accidentally sent back in time to the 50's and after complicating his mother and father's soon to be relationship he must find a way to re-unite them for his own existence depends on it. If only for the skateboard scene only, this movie provides some of the funnest scenes you will ever find. The performances are very energetic and are hard to take your eyes off. It's a 116 min roller coaster ride you'll want to get on again once it ends. By the way here's an astonishing story I found online (I'm not sure whether it's true or not): ------------------------------------------------------------ I worked at Amblin' in the 80's when all this went down, and here is what really happened. Bob Zemeckis was given a firm start date by Universal. This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz. Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule. To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things. I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart. However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place. Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage? Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy." ------------------------------------------------------------ Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch. I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked "Star Wars", "Groundhog Day", "Looper", "Wall-e", or "Jurassic Park".

    Marty McFly (Fox) is the average American kid who loves skate- boarding, chasing girls and getting late to school. His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clich&eacute;d, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch.

    You can't beat this film. Marty McFly goes back in time, in a DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. The movie, in fact, resembles Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" more than other, conventional time-travel movies. It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it. Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother "has the hots" for him. The movie's surprises are one of its great pleasures. Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.

    This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read "IT" by Stephen King or watch "Twin Peaks" by David Lynch for examples The next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom. The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list.

It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it. Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother "has the hots" for him. The movie's surprises are one of its great pleasures. Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.

    This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read "IT" by Stephen King or watch "Twin Peaks" by David Lynch for examples The next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom. The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !

    Where do I even start with "Back to the Future?" Director Robert Zemeckis has been known for sensational movies such as "Cast Away," and "Forrest Gump." But "Back to the Future," is by far my favorite of Zemeckis's movies. "Back to the Future," is about a man named Dr.Emmitt Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. When Dr. Brown makes a time machine out of a 1981 DMC DeLorean, Marty accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past. When he meets his teenage mother, to Marty's disbelief, he notices that she is more interested in him other than his father. Marty now must plan out an event with his teenage father that he believes will unite them and his existence will then be saved. The overall feeling of this film is quite exhilarating, there is some action, some romance, and quite a bit of nostalgia that I think is essential in all great movies. Not to mention some memorable quotes such as "Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that you made a time machine... out of a DeLorean?" and "Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads." Overall, "Back to the Future," is an instant classic and it has potential to be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages.

    With one Academy Award and a place in IMDb's Top 250 greatest movies of all time, Back to the Future has one on the best movies of the 1980s. Popular with the younger generation because of how it's about the younger generation and also popular with older people because of many reasons. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are the stars of this movie about an 18 year old boy who has mostly everything going for him. a hot girlfriend, talented musician but not brilliant in his school life with a certain teacher who has a dislike for him because of his family who went to that school before. Until his friend the brilliant, but a bit mental scientist Dr. Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at 1am to show him his latest invention, A time-machine, but something goes wrong and it results in Marty ending up 30 years earlier in 1955. His only hope of getting back to the future is to get help from a younger Dr. Emmett Brown. While in 1955 he runs into the younger version of his parents and makes a mistake which could erase his own existence. It's a bit of a confusing storyline which still confuses people to this day. But that is just good writing. Written and Directed by Robert Zemecks and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg. It won an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for three others, with a rating of 8.5/10 puts itself at number 45 in the Top 250 and is critically acclaimed as one of the best movies of the 80s this movie is my 2nd of all time favorite and without a doubt one of the best movies ever made.

    Robert Zemekis directed this hugely entertaining Time-travel adventure comedy as Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back in time 30 years in a De Leorean converted Time machine invented by his eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Once in 1955, he accidentally intervenes in how his parents met, resulting in him being threatened from temporal erasure! He enlists the aid of the younger Dr. Brown, to help him put things right, and get back to his future... A fine cast, witty and inventive script, and inspired direction make this a most entertaining adventure, very exciting and funny, and filled with charm, and good-natured humor about the differences in culture that 30 years can bring.

    I first watched this film when I was young, it having been recommended to me by my mother, and it remains a favourite still today. The storyline is, of course, a favourite to many, and I just loved it. The idea of time travel and the 'butterfly effect' is portrayed extremely well throughout the film, and Marty's difficulties sticking to the rules of time travel (not helped by certain characters he encounters) never fails to entertain me. The links between the people he meets in 1955 and the people in his life in 1985 are shown so well, and the comedy about the differences in technology always makes me laugh. The film was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger, as well as later on in my life.

    Back to the Future is a movie about high schooler Marty McFly who has befriended a scientist who has a discovery worth a look. Doctor Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at the mall, where he reveals a Delorean... made for time travel. The Delorean is the vessel for Marty's adventures in this very well put together trilogy. In the first movie, Marty goes back to 1955, the year his parents met. Marty tries to get back home, but the Delorean won't start, so he has to live in 1955 for a while. In 1955, Marty finds Emmett Brown, and has to convince him that he helped him travel back in time 30 years later. Emmett is Marty's only hope in getting back to 1985, but Marty's being there in 1955 has changed a few things; so even if he does get back to the future, things could be different. Can Marty get everything back to normal and get back to 1985? Find out! Once you watch the first one, you'll HAVE to watch parts II and III.

    Maybe the most rewatchable movie there is, "Back to the Future" is great family-fun and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox) is a teenager living in the 80's who's accidentally sent back in time to the 50's and after complicating his mother and father's soon to be relationship he must find a way to re-unite them for his own existence depends on it. If only for the skateboard scene only, this movie provides some of the funnest scenes you will ever find. The performances are very energetic and are hard to take your eyes off. It's a 116 min roller coaster ride you'll want to get on again once it ends. By the way here's an astonishing story I found online (I'm not sure whether it's true or not): ------------------------------------------------------------ I worked at Amblin' in the 80's when all this went down, and here is what really happened. Bob Zemeckis was given a firm start date by Universal. This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz. Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule. To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things. I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart. However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place. Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage? Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy." ------------------------------------------------------------ Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch. I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked "Star Wars", "Groundhog Day", "Looper", "Wall-e", or "Jurassic Park".

    Marty McFly (Fox) is the average American kid who loves skate- boarding, chasing girls and getting late to school. His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clich&eacute;d, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch.

Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clich&eacute;d, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch.

    You can't beat this film. Marty McFly goes back in time, in a DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. The movie, in fact, resembles Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" more than other, conventional time-travel movies. It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it. Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother "has the hots" for him. The movie's surprises are one of its great pleasures. Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.

    This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read "IT" by Stephen King or watch "Twin Peaks" by David Lynch for examples The next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom. The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !

    Where do I even start with "Back to the Future?" Director Robert Zemeckis has been known for sensational movies such as "Cast Away," and "Forrest Gump." But "Back to the Future," is by far my favorite of Zemeckis's movies. "Back to the Future," is about a man named Dr.Emmitt Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. When Dr. Brown makes a time machine out of a 1981 DMC DeLorean, Marty accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past. When he meets his teenage mother, to Marty's disbelief, he notices that she is more interested in him other than his father. Marty now must plan out an event with his teenage father that he believes will unite them and his existence will then be saved. The overall feeling of this film is quite exhilarating, there is some action, some romance, and quite a bit of nostalgia that I think is essential in all great movies. Not to mention some memorable quotes such as "Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that you made a time machine... out of a DeLorean?" and "Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads." Overall, "Back to the Future," is an instant classic and it has potential to be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages.

    With one Academy Award and a place in IMDb's Top 250 greatest movies of all time, Back to the Future has one on the best movies of the 1980s. Popular with the younger generation because of how it's about the younger generation and also popular with older people because of many reasons. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are the stars of this movie about an 18 year old boy who has mostly everything going for him. a hot girlfriend, talented musician but not brilliant in his school life with a certain teacher who has a dislike for him because of his family who went to that school before. Until his friend the brilliant, but a bit mental scientist Dr. Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at 1am to show him his latest invention, A time-machine, but something goes wrong and it results in Marty ending up 30 years earlier in 1955. His only hope of getting back to the future is to get help from a younger Dr. Emmett Brown. While in 1955 he runs into the younger version of his parents and makes a mistake which could erase his own existence. It's a bit of a confusing storyline which still confuses people to this day. But that is just good writing. Written and Directed by Robert Zemecks and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg. It won an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for three others, with a rating of 8.5/10 puts itself at number 45 in the Top 250 and is critically acclaimed as one of the best movies of the 80s this movie is my 2nd of all time favorite and without a doubt one of the best movies ever made.

    Robert Zemekis directed this hugely entertaining Time-travel adventure comedy as Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back in time 30 years in a De Leorean converted Time machine invented by his eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Once in 1955, he accidentally intervenes in how his parents met, resulting in him being threatened from temporal erasure! He enlists the aid of the younger Dr. Brown, to help him put things right, and get back to his future... A fine cast, witty and inventive script, and inspired direction make this a most entertaining adventure, very exciting and funny, and filled with charm, and good-natured humor about the differences in culture that 30 years can bring.

    I first watched this film when I was young, it having been recommended to me by my mother, and it remains a favourite still today. The storyline is, of course, a favourite to many, and I just loved it. The idea of time travel and the 'butterfly effect' is portrayed extremely well throughout the film, and Marty's difficulties sticking to the rules of time travel (not helped by certain characters he encounters) never fails to entertain me. The links between the people he meets in 1955 and the people in his life in 1985 are shown so well, and the comedy about the differences in technology always makes me laugh. The film was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger, as well as later on in my life.

    Back to the Future is a movie about high schooler Marty McFly who has befriended a scientist who has a discovery worth a look. Doctor Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at the mall, where he reveals a Delorean... made for time travel. The Delorean is the vessel for Marty's adventures in this very well put together trilogy. In the first movie, Marty goes back to 1955, the year his parents met. Marty tries to get back home, but the Delorean won't start, so he has to live in 1955 for a while. In 1955, Marty finds Emmett Brown, and has to convince him that he helped him travel back in time 30 years later. Emmett is Marty's only hope in getting back to 1985, but Marty's being there in 1955 has changed a few things; so even if he does get back to the future, things could be different. Can Marty get everything back to normal and get back to 1985? Find out! Once you watch the first one, you'll HAVE to watch parts II and III.

    Maybe the most rewatchable movie there is, "Back to the Future" is great family-fun and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox) is a teenager living in the 80's who's accidentally sent back in time to the 50's and after complicating his mother and father's soon to be relationship he must find a way to re-unite them for his own existence depends on it. If only for the skateboard scene only, this movie provides some of the funnest scenes you will ever find. The performances are very energetic and are hard to take your eyes off. It's a 116 min roller coaster ride you'll want to get on again once it ends. By the way here's an astonishing story I found online (I'm not sure whether it's true or not): ------------------------------------------------------------ I worked at Amblin' in the 80's when all this went down, and here is what really happened. Bob Zemeckis was given a firm start date by Universal. This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz. Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule. To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things. I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart. However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place. Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage? Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy." ------------------------------------------------------------ Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch. I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked "Star Wars", "Groundhog Day", "Looper", "Wall-e", or "Jurassic Park".

    Marty McFly (Fox) is the average American kid who loves skate- boarding, chasing girls and getting late to school. His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clich&eacute;d, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch.

The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy." ------------------------------------------------------------ Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch. I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked "Star Wars", "Groundhog Day", "Looper", "Wall-e", or "Jurassic Park".

    Marty McFly (Fox) is the average American kid who loves skate- boarding, chasing girls and getting late to school. His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clich&eacute;d, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch.

    You can't beat this film. Marty McFly goes back in time, in a DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. The movie, in fact, resembles Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" more than other, conventional time-travel movies. It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it. Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother "has the hots" for him. The movie's surprises are one of its great pleasures. Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.

    This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read "IT" by Stephen King or watch "Twin Peaks" by David Lynch for examples The next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom. The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !

    Where do I even start with "Back to the Future?" Director Robert Zemeckis has been known for sensational movies such as "Cast Away," and "Forrest Gump." But "Back to the Future," is by far my favorite of Zemeckis's movies. "Back to the Future," is about a man named Dr.Emmitt Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. When Dr. Brown makes a time machine out of a 1981 DMC DeLorean, Marty accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past. When he meets his teenage mother, to Marty's disbelief, he notices that she is more interested in him other than his father. Marty now must plan out an event with his teenage father that he believes will unite them and his existence will then be saved. The overall feeling of this film is quite exhilarating, there is some action, some romance, and quite a bit of nostalgia that I think is essential in all great movies. Not to mention some memorable quotes such as "Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that you made a time machine... out of a DeLorean?" and "Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads." Overall, "Back to the Future," is an instant classic and it has potential to be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages.

    With one Academy Award and a place in IMDb's Top 250 greatest movies of all time, Back to the Future has one on the best movies of the 1980s. Popular with the younger generation because of how it's about the younger generation and also popular with older people because of many reasons. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are the stars of this movie about an 18 year old boy who has mostly everything going for him. a hot girlfriend, talented musician but not brilliant in his school life with a certain teacher who has a dislike for him because of his family who went to that school before. Until his friend the brilliant, but a bit mental scientist Dr. Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at 1am to show him his latest invention, A time-machine, but something goes wrong and it results in Marty ending up 30 years earlier in 1955. His only hope of getting back to the future is to get help from a younger Dr. Emmett Brown. While in 1955 he runs into the younger version of his parents and makes a mistake which could erase his own existence. It's a bit of a confusing storyline which still confuses people to this day. But that is just good writing. Written and Directed by Robert Zemecks and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg. It won an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for three others, with a rating of 8.5/10 puts itself at number 45 in the Top 250 and is critically acclaimed as one of the best movies of the 80s this movie is my 2nd of all time favorite and without a doubt one of the best movies ever made.
