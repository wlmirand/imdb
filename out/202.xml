 <sinopse>
  A weatherman finds himself living the same day over and over again.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A weather man is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting "rat" (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realisation that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing EVERY day.

    A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, "Groundhog Day" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry. Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him. "Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future," he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed. It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in "Caddyshack," his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, "Rise and shine, campers," calls us back to Murray's film debut, "Meatballs." But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like "Lost In Translation" and "The Life Aquatic." Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: "I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it." The repetitive nature of "Groundhog Day" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on "Saturday Night Live." It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole. Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on "SCTV," frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis. What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a "glass-half-empty kind of guy," as one of Phil's new local friends puts it. The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film. But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as "Groundhog Day."

    I only watched this movie because of all the comparisons with 'About Time' I was reading. For those who have seen 'About Time' and have seen this will know that they are not similar at all. Time travel and time loops are two different things. But both films use their respective 'gimmicks' to their advantage. But I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by this movie. It was funny, but not laugh-of-loud funny. It had an interesting concept, but wasn't thought-provoking. It was just a perfectly average comedy. It does have a great story and the narrative is structured brilliantly. 'Phil Connors', Bill Murray's character, is stuck in a time loop but the film never feels repetitive. Harold Ramis, the director, and Danny Rubin, the writer, did a great job in keeping the story flowing and the laughs coming. But had it not been for Bill Murray, I probably would have lost interest in the film half way through. Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe the film requires repeated viewings, but I don't think it's one the funniest films I've ever seen.

    From the outset, I didn't particularly like the music, the production or any of the cast members, nor did I rate this film anything other than 'really good fun' after first screening, but after many viewings and the passing of years I now rate this film as one of the best, if not THE best, film I've ever seen. Take my final statement with a pinch of salt if you like. It is a subjective opinion. I think the depth of scriptwriting in this film is amazing. A group of people have sat down and discussed, 'how would we feel, personally, if we went through these events ourselves'. What would our initial, gradual and long-term reactions be? What are the underlying core characteristics of a human being. Good or bad? The day repeats over and over again, ad infinitum, followed by initial disbelief and shock. Check that. The next emotion is euphoria at realising that there are "no consequences" and as much debauchery can be committed as desired, followed by a more calculated period of manipulation, trying to get exactly what he wants (Phil that is, played by Bill Murray), then followed by extreme depression when he finally realises the most desired things in his life cannot actually be obtained, followed by enlightenment and the understanding of what life really is all about - trying to be the best you possible can. But above all, this is a story about love. A man tries everything in his power to get the thing he desires most (Rita, played by Andie MacDowell), but after trying every trick in the book, realises the only way to achieve that goal is to first concentrate on becoming a better person. The rest comes naturally. It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favourites of all-time. In the decades to come, when I'm old, my family will probably complain about that 'daft' film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.

    When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage. I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy. Yeah. I liked it. There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is  if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades. But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy. I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.

    The film Groundhog Day takes place in Pennsylvania and is based around an annual celebration of Groundhogs Day itself. Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again. Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change. Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things "right." This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

    Bill Murray is a funny guy and there are three films of his you need to see - Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day and Lost in Translation. All of them showcase his great acting talents and comedic genius but most importantly they all are smart entertainment. Groundhog Day is a comedy that is almost scary in how deep it is. It's mostly thanks to absolutely stellar script and a very strong, tragically overlooked performance by Bill Murray. Everything about this film works both dramatically and comedicly. Sadly there isn't enough comedies like this and we have to suffer trough endless slew of gross out boozing movies about unlikable teenagers or dude bros and watch their unfunny odysseys of trying to get laid and stuff. How about a comedy that tells a story about a flawed man who strives to be a better person? Is it so hard to do something like that? Go watch Groundhog Day in penance for all the unfunny, badly written Judd Apatow and other hack fraud films you have seen. Stories and characters make good comedies not just gags and improv...

    This is just about the greatest film ever made. It is absolutely perfect. Harold Ramis is a lot funnier than Frank Capra and this movie is like an intelligent version of It's a Wonderful Life (a film I detest). With this movie we realize that Bill Murray is a really fine actor and the movie is a true classic. I actually started to play the piano because of this film and although I never became the pianist Bill Murray is in the film I have enjoyed every bit of the experience. We have choices in life. You can either be petty and mean or you can go out and make something of a decent person of yourself. Start today.

    A fantastic idea for a movie and the part played by Bill could not have been better cast, his persona and facial expressions are just perfect.the only bad comment i have of this movie would be that the morals of the movie at the ending are so predictable and so Americanized, they should have just left him there day after day just going round in circles would have been awesome or for that fact multiple endings you choose the one you want. The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not. But all in all a very enjoyable light comedy could have been better with some darker humor..

    It never occurred to me that this movie, which I heard being referenced a lot of times in pop culture, would be this good, and good I mean a whole lot of it, so that you take away something from it and can keep revisiting it any day you feel like it. The only other movie I can think of in the parallel lines is It's a Wonderful life. What's so great about it is that you can, and you will, laugh all through its duration, you will also get a better disposition on what you could do when placed in a moment that's so despairing as Murray's Phil in this. Let me tell which many would already know. Murray is outstanding and brilliant here. And so is the script and direction by Harold Ramis. It really does take a heck lot of work to keep a movie under two hours and have your audience to think and feel like 'Man, it's great' and that's exactly what Harold and Murray have done in this extremely warm and sublime movie of this spiritual and intellectual worth.

    Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again... Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness. Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again

The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

    Bill Murray is a funny guy and there are three films of his you need to see - Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day and Lost in Translation. All of them showcase his great acting talents and comedic genius but most importantly they all are smart entertainment. Groundhog Day is a comedy that is almost scary in how deep it is. It's mostly thanks to absolutely stellar script and a very strong, tragically overlooked performance by Bill Murray. Everything about this film works both dramatically and comedicly. Sadly there isn't enough comedies like this and we have to suffer trough endless slew of gross out boozing movies about unlikable teenagers or dude bros and watch their unfunny odysseys of trying to get laid and stuff. How about a comedy that tells a story about a flawed man who strives to be a better person? Is it so hard to do something like that? Go watch Groundhog Day in penance for all the unfunny, badly written Judd Apatow and other hack fraud films you have seen. Stories and characters make good comedies not just gags and improv...

    This is just about the greatest film ever made. It is absolutely perfect. Harold Ramis is a lot funnier than Frank Capra and this movie is like an intelligent version of It's a Wonderful Life (a film I detest). With this movie we realize that Bill Murray is a really fine actor and the movie is a true classic. I actually started to play the piano because of this film and although I never became the pianist Bill Murray is in the film I have enjoyed every bit of the experience. We have choices in life. You can either be petty and mean or you can go out and make something of a decent person of yourself. Start today.

    A fantastic idea for a movie and the part played by Bill could not have been better cast, his persona and facial expressions are just perfect.the only bad comment i have of this movie would be that the morals of the movie at the ending are so predictable and so Americanized, they should have just left him there day after day just going round in circles would have been awesome or for that fact multiple endings you choose the one you want. The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not. But all in all a very enjoyable light comedy could have been better with some darker humor..

    It never occurred to me that this movie, which I heard being referenced a lot of times in pop culture, would be this good, and good I mean a whole lot of it, so that you take away something from it and can keep revisiting it any day you feel like it. The only other movie I can think of in the parallel lines is It's a Wonderful life. What's so great about it is that you can, and you will, laugh all through its duration, you will also get a better disposition on what you could do when placed in a moment that's so despairing as Murray's Phil in this. Let me tell which many would already know. Murray is outstanding and brilliant here. And so is the script and direction by Harold Ramis. It really does take a heck lot of work to keep a movie under two hours and have your audience to think and feel like 'Man, it's great' and that's exactly what Harold and Murray have done in this extremely warm and sublime movie of this spiritual and intellectual worth.

    Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again... Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness. Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again

    A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, "Groundhog Day" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry. Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him. "Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future," he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed. It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in "Caddyshack," his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, "Rise and shine, campers," calls us back to Murray's film debut, "Meatballs." But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like "Lost In Translation" and "The Life Aquatic." Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: "I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it." The repetitive nature of "Groundhog Day" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on "Saturday Night Live." It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole. Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on "SCTV," frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis. What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a "glass-half-empty kind of guy," as one of Phil's new local friends puts it. The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film. But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as "Groundhog Day."

    I only watched this movie because of all the comparisons with 'About Time' I was reading. For those who have seen 'About Time' and have seen this will know that they are not similar at all. Time travel and time loops are two different things. But both films use their respective 'gimmicks' to their advantage. But I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by this movie. It was funny, but not laugh-of-loud funny. It had an interesting concept, but wasn't thought-provoking. It was just a perfectly average comedy. It does have a great story and the narrative is structured brilliantly. 'Phil Connors', Bill Murray's character, is stuck in a time loop but the film never feels repetitive. Harold Ramis, the director, and Danny Rubin, the writer, did a great job in keeping the story flowing and the laughs coming. But had it not been for Bill Murray, I probably would have lost interest in the film half way through. Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe the film requires repeated viewings, but I don't think it's one the funniest films I've ever seen.

    From the outset, I didn't particularly like the music, the production or any of the cast members, nor did I rate this film anything other than 'really good fun' after first screening, but after many viewings and the passing of years I now rate this film as one of the best, if not THE best, film I've ever seen. Take my final statement with a pinch of salt if you like. It is a subjective opinion. I think the depth of scriptwriting in this film is amazing. A group of people have sat down and discussed, 'how would we feel, personally, if we went through these events ourselves'. What would our initial, gradual and long-term reactions be? What are the underlying core characteristics of a human being. Good or bad? The day repeats over and over again, ad infinitum, followed by initial disbelief and shock. Check that. The next emotion is euphoria at realising that there are "no consequences" and as much debauchery can be committed as desired, followed by a more calculated period of manipulation, trying to get exactly what he wants (Phil that is, played by Bill Murray), then followed by extreme depression when he finally realises the most desired things in his life cannot actually be obtained, followed by enlightenment and the understanding of what life really is all about - trying to be the best you possible can. But above all, this is a story about love. A man tries everything in his power to get the thing he desires most (Rita, played by Andie MacDowell), but after trying every trick in the book, realises the only way to achieve that goal is to first concentrate on becoming a better person. The rest comes naturally. It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favourites of all-time. In the decades to come, when I'm old, my family will probably complain about that 'daft' film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.

    When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage. I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy. Yeah. I liked it. There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is  if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades. But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy. I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.

    The film Groundhog Day takes place in Pennsylvania and is based around an annual celebration of Groundhogs Day itself. Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again. Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change. Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things "right." This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

The rest comes naturally. It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favourites of all-time. In the decades to come, when I'm old, my family will probably complain about that 'daft' film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.

    When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage. I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy. Yeah. I liked it. There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is  if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades. But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy. I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.

    The film Groundhog Day takes place in Pennsylvania and is based around an annual celebration of Groundhogs Day itself. Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again. Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change. Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things "right." This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

    Bill Murray is a funny guy and there are three films of his you need to see - Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day and Lost in Translation. All of them showcase his great acting talents and comedic genius but most importantly they all are smart entertainment. Groundhog Day is a comedy that is almost scary in how deep it is. It's mostly thanks to absolutely stellar script and a very strong, tragically overlooked performance by Bill Murray. Everything about this film works both dramatically and comedicly. Sadly there isn't enough comedies like this and we have to suffer trough endless slew of gross out boozing movies about unlikable teenagers or dude bros and watch their unfunny odysseys of trying to get laid and stuff. How about a comedy that tells a story about a flawed man who strives to be a better person? Is it so hard to do something like that? Go watch Groundhog Day in penance for all the unfunny, badly written Judd Apatow and other hack fraud films you have seen. Stories and characters make good comedies not just gags and improv...

    This is just about the greatest film ever made. It is absolutely perfect. Harold Ramis is a lot funnier than Frank Capra and this movie is like an intelligent version of It's a Wonderful Life (a film I detest). With this movie we realize that Bill Murray is a really fine actor and the movie is a true classic. I actually started to play the piano because of this film and although I never became the pianist Bill Murray is in the film I have enjoyed every bit of the experience. We have choices in life. You can either be petty and mean or you can go out and make something of a decent person of yourself. Start today.

    A fantastic idea for a movie and the part played by Bill could not have been better cast, his persona and facial expressions are just perfect.the only bad comment i have of this movie would be that the morals of the movie at the ending are so predictable and so Americanized, they should have just left him there day after day just going round in circles would have been awesome or for that fact multiple endings you choose the one you want. The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not. But all in all a very enjoyable light comedy could have been better with some darker humor..

    It never occurred to me that this movie, which I heard being referenced a lot of times in pop culture, would be this good, and good I mean a whole lot of it, so that you take away something from it and can keep revisiting it any day you feel like it. The only other movie I can think of in the parallel lines is It's a Wonderful life. What's so great about it is that you can, and you will, laugh all through its duration, you will also get a better disposition on what you could do when placed in a moment that's so despairing as Murray's Phil in this. Let me tell which many would already know. Murray is outstanding and brilliant here. And so is the script and direction by Harold Ramis. It really does take a heck lot of work to keep a movie under two hours and have your audience to think and feel like 'Man, it's great' and that's exactly what Harold and Murray have done in this extremely warm and sublime movie of this spiritual and intellectual worth.

    Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again... Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness. Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again

    A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, "Groundhog Day" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry. Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him. "Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future," he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed. It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in "Caddyshack," his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, "Rise and shine, campers," calls us back to Murray's film debut, "Meatballs." But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like "Lost In Translation" and "The Life Aquatic." Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: "I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it." The repetitive nature of "Groundhog Day" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on "Saturday Night Live." It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole. Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on "SCTV," frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis. What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a "glass-half-empty kind of guy," as one of Phil's new local friends puts it. The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film. But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as "Groundhog Day."

    I only watched this movie because of all the comparisons with 'About Time' I was reading. For those who have seen 'About Time' and have seen this will know that they are not similar at all. Time travel and time loops are two different things. But both films use their respective 'gimmicks' to their advantage. But I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by this movie. It was funny, but not laugh-of-loud funny. It had an interesting concept, but wasn't thought-provoking. It was just a perfectly average comedy. It does have a great story and the narrative is structured brilliantly. 'Phil Connors', Bill Murray's character, is stuck in a time loop but the film never feels repetitive. Harold Ramis, the director, and Danny Rubin, the writer, did a great job in keeping the story flowing and the laughs coming. But had it not been for Bill Murray, I probably would have lost interest in the film half way through. Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe the film requires repeated viewings, but I don't think it's one the funniest films I've ever seen.

    From the outset, I didn't particularly like the music, the production or any of the cast members, nor did I rate this film anything other than 'really good fun' after first screening, but after many viewings and the passing of years I now rate this film as one of the best, if not THE best, film I've ever seen. Take my final statement with a pinch of salt if you like. It is a subjective opinion. I think the depth of scriptwriting in this film is amazing. A group of people have sat down and discussed, 'how would we feel, personally, if we went through these events ourselves'. What would our initial, gradual and long-term reactions be? What are the underlying core characteristics of a human being. Good or bad? The day repeats over and over again, ad infinitum, followed by initial disbelief and shock. Check that. The next emotion is euphoria at realising that there are "no consequences" and as much debauchery can be committed as desired, followed by a more calculated period of manipulation, trying to get exactly what he wants (Phil that is, played by Bill Murray), then followed by extreme depression when he finally realises the most desired things in his life cannot actually be obtained, followed by enlightenment and the understanding of what life really is all about - trying to be the best you possible can. But above all, this is a story about love. A man tries everything in his power to get the thing he desires most (Rita, played by Andie MacDowell), but after trying every trick in the book, realises the only way to achieve that goal is to first concentrate on becoming a better person. The rest comes naturally. It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favourites of all-time. In the decades to come, when I'm old, my family will probably complain about that 'daft' film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.

We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis. What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a "glass-half-empty kind of guy," as one of Phil's new local friends puts it. The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film. But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as "Groundhog Day."

    I only watched this movie because of all the comparisons with 'About Time' I was reading. For those who have seen 'About Time' and have seen this will know that they are not similar at all. Time travel and time loops are two different things. But both films use their respective 'gimmicks' to their advantage. But I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by this movie. It was funny, but not laugh-of-loud funny. It had an interesting concept, but wasn't thought-provoking. It was just a perfectly average comedy. It does have a great story and the narrative is structured brilliantly. 'Phil Connors', Bill Murray's character, is stuck in a time loop but the film never feels repetitive. Harold Ramis, the director, and Danny Rubin, the writer, did a great job in keeping the story flowing and the laughs coming. But had it not been for Bill Murray, I probably would have lost interest in the film half way through. Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe the film requires repeated viewings, but I don't think it's one the funniest films I've ever seen.

    From the outset, I didn't particularly like the music, the production or any of the cast members, nor did I rate this film anything other than 'really good fun' after first screening, but after many viewings and the passing of years I now rate this film as one of the best, if not THE best, film I've ever seen. Take my final statement with a pinch of salt if you like. It is a subjective opinion. I think the depth of scriptwriting in this film is amazing. A group of people have sat down and discussed, 'how would we feel, personally, if we went through these events ourselves'. What would our initial, gradual and long-term reactions be? What are the underlying core characteristics of a human being. Good or bad? The day repeats over and over again, ad infinitum, followed by initial disbelief and shock. Check that. The next emotion is euphoria at realising that there are "no consequences" and as much debauchery can be committed as desired, followed by a more calculated period of manipulation, trying to get exactly what he wants (Phil that is, played by Bill Murray), then followed by extreme depression when he finally realises the most desired things in his life cannot actually be obtained, followed by enlightenment and the understanding of what life really is all about - trying to be the best you possible can. But above all, this is a story about love. A man tries everything in his power to get the thing he desires most (Rita, played by Andie MacDowell), but after trying every trick in the book, realises the only way to achieve that goal is to first concentrate on becoming a better person. The rest comes naturally. It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favourites of all-time. In the decades to come, when I'm old, my family will probably complain about that 'daft' film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.

    When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage. I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy. Yeah. I liked it. There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is  if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades. But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy. I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.

    The film Groundhog Day takes place in Pennsylvania and is based around an annual celebration of Groundhogs Day itself. Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again. Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change. Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things "right." This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

    Bill Murray is a funny guy and there are three films of his you need to see - Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day and Lost in Translation. All of them showcase his great acting talents and comedic genius but most importantly they all are smart entertainment. Groundhog Day is a comedy that is almost scary in how deep it is. It's mostly thanks to absolutely stellar script and a very strong, tragically overlooked performance by Bill Murray. Everything about this film works both dramatically and comedicly. Sadly there isn't enough comedies like this and we have to suffer trough endless slew of gross out boozing movies about unlikable teenagers or dude bros and watch their unfunny odysseys of trying to get laid and stuff. How about a comedy that tells a story about a flawed man who strives to be a better person? Is it so hard to do something like that? Go watch Groundhog Day in penance for all the unfunny, badly written Judd Apatow and other hack fraud films you have seen. Stories and characters make good comedies not just gags and improv...

    This is just about the greatest film ever made. It is absolutely perfect. Harold Ramis is a lot funnier than Frank Capra and this movie is like an intelligent version of It's a Wonderful Life (a film I detest). With this movie we realize that Bill Murray is a really fine actor and the movie is a true classic. I actually started to play the piano because of this film and although I never became the pianist Bill Murray is in the film I have enjoyed every bit of the experience. We have choices in life. You can either be petty and mean or you can go out and make something of a decent person of yourself. Start today.

    A fantastic idea for a movie and the part played by Bill could not have been better cast, his persona and facial expressions are just perfect.the only bad comment i have of this movie would be that the morals of the movie at the ending are so predictable and so Americanized, they should have just left him there day after day just going round in circles would have been awesome or for that fact multiple endings you choose the one you want. The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not. But all in all a very enjoyable light comedy could have been better with some darker humor..

    It never occurred to me that this movie, which I heard being referenced a lot of times in pop culture, would be this good, and good I mean a whole lot of it, so that you take away something from it and can keep revisiting it any day you feel like it. The only other movie I can think of in the parallel lines is It's a Wonderful life. What's so great about it is that you can, and you will, laugh all through its duration, you will also get a better disposition on what you could do when placed in a moment that's so despairing as Murray's Phil in this. Let me tell which many would already know. Murray is outstanding and brilliant here. And so is the script and direction by Harold Ramis. It really does take a heck lot of work to keep a movie under two hours and have your audience to think and feel like 'Man, it's great' and that's exactly what Harold and Murray have done in this extremely warm and sublime movie of this spiritual and intellectual worth.

    Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again... Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness. Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again

    A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, "Groundhog Day" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry. Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him. "Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future," he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed. It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in "Caddyshack," his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, "Rise and shine, campers," calls us back to Murray's film debut, "Meatballs." But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like "Lost In Translation" and "The Life Aquatic." Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: "I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it." The repetitive nature of "Groundhog Day" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on "Saturday Night Live." It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole. Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on "SCTV," frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis. What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a "glass-half-empty kind of guy," as one of Phil's new local friends puts it. The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film. But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as "Groundhog Day."

What's so great about it is that you can, and you will, laugh all through its duration, you will also get a better disposition on what you could do when placed in a moment that's so despairing as Murray's Phil in this. Let me tell which many would already know. Murray is outstanding and brilliant here. And so is the script and direction by Harold Ramis. It really does take a heck lot of work to keep a movie under two hours and have your audience to think and feel like 'Man, it's great' and that's exactly what Harold and Murray have done in this extremely warm and sublime movie of this spiritual and intellectual worth.

    Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again... Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness. Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again

    A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, "Groundhog Day" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry. Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him. "Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future," he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed. It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in "Caddyshack," his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, "Rise and shine, campers," calls us back to Murray's film debut, "Meatballs." But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like "Lost In Translation" and "The Life Aquatic." Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: "I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it." The repetitive nature of "Groundhog Day" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on "Saturday Night Live." It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole. Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on "SCTV," frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis. What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a "glass-half-empty kind of guy," as one of Phil's new local friends puts it. The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film. But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as "Groundhog Day."

    I only watched this movie because of all the comparisons with 'About Time' I was reading. For those who have seen 'About Time' and have seen this will know that they are not similar at all. Time travel and time loops are two different things. But both films use their respective 'gimmicks' to their advantage. But I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by this movie. It was funny, but not laugh-of-loud funny. It had an interesting concept, but wasn't thought-provoking. It was just a perfectly average comedy. It does have a great story and the narrative is structured brilliantly. 'Phil Connors', Bill Murray's character, is stuck in a time loop but the film never feels repetitive. Harold Ramis, the director, and Danny Rubin, the writer, did a great job in keeping the story flowing and the laughs coming. But had it not been for Bill Murray, I probably would have lost interest in the film half way through. Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe the film requires repeated viewings, but I don't think it's one the funniest films I've ever seen.

    From the outset, I didn't particularly like the music, the production or any of the cast members, nor did I rate this film anything other than 'really good fun' after first screening, but after many viewings and the passing of years I now rate this film as one of the best, if not THE best, film I've ever seen. Take my final statement with a pinch of salt if you like. It is a subjective opinion. I think the depth of scriptwriting in this film is amazing. A group of people have sat down and discussed, 'how would we feel, personally, if we went through these events ourselves'. What would our initial, gradual and long-term reactions be? What are the underlying core characteristics of a human being. Good or bad? The day repeats over and over again, ad infinitum, followed by initial disbelief and shock. Check that. The next emotion is euphoria at realising that there are "no consequences" and as much debauchery can be committed as desired, followed by a more calculated period of manipulation, trying to get exactly what he wants (Phil that is, played by Bill Murray), then followed by extreme depression when he finally realises the most desired things in his life cannot actually be obtained, followed by enlightenment and the understanding of what life really is all about - trying to be the best you possible can. But above all, this is a story about love. A man tries everything in his power to get the thing he desires most (Rita, played by Andie MacDowell), but after trying every trick in the book, realises the only way to achieve that goal is to first concentrate on becoming a better person. The rest comes naturally. It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favourites of all-time. In the decades to come, when I'm old, my family will probably complain about that 'daft' film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.

    When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage. I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy. Yeah. I liked it. There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is  if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades. But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy. I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.

    The film Groundhog Day takes place in Pennsylvania and is based around an annual celebration of Groundhogs Day itself. Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again. Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change. Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things "right." This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

    Bill Murray is a funny guy and there are three films of his you need to see - Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day and Lost in Translation. All of them showcase his great acting talents and comedic genius but most importantly they all are smart entertainment. Groundhog Day is a comedy that is almost scary in how deep it is. It's mostly thanks to absolutely stellar script and a very strong, tragically overlooked performance by Bill Murray. Everything about this film works both dramatically and comedicly. Sadly there isn't enough comedies like this and we have to suffer trough endless slew of gross out boozing movies about unlikable teenagers or dude bros and watch their unfunny odysseys of trying to get laid and stuff. How about a comedy that tells a story about a flawed man who strives to be a better person? Is it so hard to do something like that? Go watch Groundhog Day in penance for all the unfunny, badly written Judd Apatow and other hack fraud films you have seen. Stories and characters make good comedies not just gags and improv...

    This is just about the greatest film ever made. It is absolutely perfect. Harold Ramis is a lot funnier than Frank Capra and this movie is like an intelligent version of It's a Wonderful Life (a film I detest). With this movie we realize that Bill Murray is a really fine actor and the movie is a true classic. I actually started to play the piano because of this film and although I never became the pianist Bill Murray is in the film I have enjoyed every bit of the experience. We have choices in life. You can either be petty and mean or you can go out and make something of a decent person of yourself. Start today.

    A fantastic idea for a movie and the part played by Bill could not have been better cast, his persona and facial expressions are just perfect.the only bad comment i have of this movie would be that the morals of the movie at the ending are so predictable and so Americanized, they should have just left him there day after day just going round in circles would have been awesome or for that fact multiple endings you choose the one you want. The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not. But all in all a very enjoyable light comedy could have been better with some darker humor..

Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things "right." This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

    Bill Murray is a funny guy and there are three films of his you need to see - Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day and Lost in Translation. All of them showcase his great acting talents and comedic genius but most importantly they all are smart entertainment. Groundhog Day is a comedy that is almost scary in how deep it is. It's mostly thanks to absolutely stellar script and a very strong, tragically overlooked performance by Bill Murray. Everything about this film works both dramatically and comedicly. Sadly there isn't enough comedies like this and we have to suffer trough endless slew of gross out boozing movies about unlikable teenagers or dude bros and watch their unfunny odysseys of trying to get laid and stuff. How about a comedy that tells a story about a flawed man who strives to be a better person? Is it so hard to do something like that? Go watch Groundhog Day in penance for all the unfunny, badly written Judd Apatow and other hack fraud films you have seen. Stories and characters make good comedies not just gags and improv...

    This is just about the greatest film ever made. It is absolutely perfect. Harold Ramis is a lot funnier than Frank Capra and this movie is like an intelligent version of It's a Wonderful Life (a film I detest). With this movie we realize that Bill Murray is a really fine actor and the movie is a true classic. I actually started to play the piano because of this film and although I never became the pianist Bill Murray is in the film I have enjoyed every bit of the experience. We have choices in life. You can either be petty and mean or you can go out and make something of a decent person of yourself. Start today.

    A fantastic idea for a movie and the part played by Bill could not have been better cast, his persona and facial expressions are just perfect.the only bad comment i have of this movie would be that the morals of the movie at the ending are so predictable and so Americanized, they should have just left him there day after day just going round in circles would have been awesome or for that fact multiple endings you choose the one you want. The supporting cast just superb with all members putting in excellent performances backing Bill up with just impeccable comedy timing, probably with some help from the director, maybe not. But all in all a very enjoyable light comedy could have been better with some darker humor..

    It never occurred to me that this movie, which I heard being referenced a lot of times in pop culture, would be this good, and good I mean a whole lot of it, so that you take away something from it and can keep revisiting it any day you feel like it. The only other movie I can think of in the parallel lines is It's a Wonderful life. What's so great about it is that you can, and you will, laugh all through its duration, you will also get a better disposition on what you could do when placed in a moment that's so despairing as Murray's Phil in this. Let me tell which many would already know. Murray is outstanding and brilliant here. And so is the script and direction by Harold Ramis. It really does take a heck lot of work to keep a movie under two hours and have your audience to think and feel like 'Man, it's great' and that's exactly what Harold and Murray have done in this extremely warm and sublime movie of this spiritual and intellectual worth.

    Why is this movie so universal? Why is to so funny and charming, so human and so addictive? I reckon it's because it answers so many important questions that each and every one of us seek answer to fruitlessly every day of our lives. Story is original and funny, a bitter and somewhat misanthropic weatherman comes on business to a small town which he despises from the very bottom of his soul, only to have his life completely flipped around when he starts reliving the same day again, and again, and again... Wrapped up in a cocoon of simple story in a small rural town, Groundhog day turns out to be a self-help vessel carrying to us a reminder of what is really important in life. Although it never openly preaches it's message, somehow along this journey I found myself being gradually filled up with feelings I want to be filled up with everyday of my life. Turning on the movie and starting out with mundane grey feelings of everyday life full of useless obligatory commitments, suddenly I wanted to love, to be nice to people and to be accepted, to learn as much as possible and to help, to share, to give, and to be given in return nothing else but happiness. Not many movies have you feel proud to be a human being by the end, and even less of them leave you with a desire to self improve and be a better person, Groundhog day is luckily one of them, and you definitely owe yourself to watch it. And when these feelings leave your side, force yourself to watch it again, and again, and again

    A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, "Groundhog Day" is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry. Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him. "Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future," he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed. It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in "Caddyshack," his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, "Rise and shine, campers," calls us back to Murray's film debut, "Meatballs." But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like "Lost In Translation" and "The Life Aquatic." Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: "I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it." The repetitive nature of "Groundhog Day" throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on "Saturday Night Live." It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole. Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on "SCTV," frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis. What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a "glass-half-empty kind of guy," as one of Phil's new local friends puts it. The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film. But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as "Groundhog Day."

    I only watched this movie because of all the comparisons with 'About Time' I was reading. For those who have seen 'About Time' and have seen this will know that they are not similar at all. Time travel and time loops are two different things. But both films use their respective 'gimmicks' to their advantage. But I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by this movie. It was funny, but not laugh-of-loud funny. It had an interesting concept, but wasn't thought-provoking. It was just a perfectly average comedy. It does have a great story and the narrative is structured brilliantly. 'Phil Connors', Bill Murray's character, is stuck in a time loop but the film never feels repetitive. Harold Ramis, the director, and Danny Rubin, the writer, did a great job in keeping the story flowing and the laughs coming. But had it not been for Bill Murray, I probably would have lost interest in the film half way through. Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe the film requires repeated viewings, but I don't think it's one the funniest films I've ever seen.

    From the outset, I didn't particularly like the music, the production or any of the cast members, nor did I rate this film anything other than 'really good fun' after first screening, but after many viewings and the passing of years I now rate this film as one of the best, if not THE best, film I've ever seen. Take my final statement with a pinch of salt if you like. It is a subjective opinion. I think the depth of scriptwriting in this film is amazing. A group of people have sat down and discussed, 'how would we feel, personally, if we went through these events ourselves'. What would our initial, gradual and long-term reactions be? What are the underlying core characteristics of a human being. Good or bad? The day repeats over and over again, ad infinitum, followed by initial disbelief and shock. Check that. The next emotion is euphoria at realising that there are "no consequences" and as much debauchery can be committed as desired, followed by a more calculated period of manipulation, trying to get exactly what he wants (Phil that is, played by Bill Murray), then followed by extreme depression when he finally realises the most desired things in his life cannot actually be obtained, followed by enlightenment and the understanding of what life really is all about - trying to be the best you possible can. But above all, this is a story about love. A man tries everything in his power to get the thing he desires most (Rita, played by Andie MacDowell), but after trying every trick in the book, realises the only way to achieve that goal is to first concentrate on becoming a better person. The rest comes naturally. It's a funny, uplifting, rewarding and enlightening film that's grown to be one of my favourites of all-time. In the decades to come, when I'm old, my family will probably complain about that 'daft' film that I like so much, but oh how little they really know.

    When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage. I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy. Yeah. I liked it. There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is  if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades. But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy. I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.

    The film Groundhog Day takes place in Pennsylvania and is based around an annual celebration of Groundhogs Day itself. Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again. Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change. Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things "right." This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.
