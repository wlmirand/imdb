    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    I remember seeing this in my teens and being distinctly underwhelmed. But Akira is a film whose stature has grown with time so I thought it would be worth another look in my thirties. It's taken me five days to get to the final third as I keep falling asleep. Many reviewers have commented on the beautiful animation that to me looks utterly average. Many have also mentioned the character development, which presumably impresses people who've never read a book. Still others praise the apocalyptic nature of Akira, which is never believable for an instant. Some decry the film for its gore content, which would at least have kept me awake. I guess I just don't get this kind of film. Seems to me like fodder for culture-starved teens and emotionally immature adults. Hmmmmmmm.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    In 1988 the animation audience were used to watch the same fairy tail since 1937 that Disney provided with 'snow white' where "happy and ever" ruled and there was no violence or anything to create a REAL climax between the characters with a good mix of blood and explosions. But that was until 1988. After Katsuhiro Otomo released his controversial "Akira" the world of animation realized that there was no limits for story or action to make a good movie. With a unusual and powerful story, combined with explosive actions sequences and outstanding visuals, Akira turns out to be one of the greatest animations ever made, and open the doors of this entire anime universe we have today.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

    (Dubbed version). I was really interested in watching "Akira", since everybody still mentions it as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, 25 years after its release (1988). You van definitely tell that the animation still looks pretty good, 25 years after. A lot of details in the backgrounds, and the way the main characters were draw. It is important to also mention, that the scenes of violence and topics covered (anarchy, experimentation in human subjects) were not common in animation by 1988 (at least in western animation, which is the one I am familiar with), which is probably also one of things that makes it a hallmark in animation. However, after watching the movie, I was never too engaged with the plot. In my opinion, there were too many things going at the same time (the fight of Kei's revolutionary group, what was the whole point of the ester's, the concept of the internal energy in every human) that did not allow me to focus in any of them, so I felt the narrative and the story a bit chopped. I know it might be because they tried to condensate a whole manga into a movie, but these should be 2 independent pieces of art, the movie should not rely on you reading the book to understand it, otherwise what is the point. Overall, I was not fully satisfied by the movie, making it an experience that I did not hate neither enjoy. (I learned also that I am not the biggest fan of Cyberpunk, as Akira belongs to this SciFi genre) Score (5)

    it is a long movie, and you will probably get a lil bored about half-way through, until the end, and the characters are weak in their storyline. this is mainly an action movie, but it seems like they also want it to be about the story-line. it could have been a lot better at building up the great story concept, and adding some more action scenes, but for 1988, this movie deserves a 10+. i give it a 7 or 6 for what i'm used to now, but i feel this IS a milestone for its time and every anime lover should have a copy) so if you don't mind looking back towards the past and watching a decent anime, this one is for ya. also...the front cover has a pic of a dude and a motorcycle and a picture of a pill on the back of his shirt. his motorcycle is hardly in the movie, and the pill pretty much is never seen in the movie, so i don't know how they come up with that. like i said, the story line is weak, and put together quite badly, but hey, it is 1988, and the graphics still look GREAT today)

    Akira is single worst film I have ever sit through. Manos: The Hands of Fate was far more entertaining and had better plot than this diarrhea of a film. It's badly written, loaded with pretense of being important and ugly. The very reason why this film is so loved and revered as a masterpiece is just baffling to me. Akira looks like a huge budget Troma animated film without the camp or their trademark humor. It's visually disgusting and repulsive to look at. Every other minute they feel the need add gore and loads of blood. The fluid animation is impressive and the detail is incredible but doesn't matter since everything else is terrible. The character designs look terrible and our two leads are completely indistinguishable from each other. Would have helped if they bothered with any means of character development or explaining who's who and what's their history. But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    Wow. OK so I'm a big anime fan, and I've always heard of this when the greatest anime movies were listed. It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed. Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it. It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater) Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece. 9/10

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

    (Dubbed version). I was really interested in watching "Akira", since everybody still mentions it as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, 25 years after its release (1988). You van definitely tell that the animation still looks pretty good, 25 years after. A lot of details in the backgrounds, and the way the main characters were draw. It is important to also mention, that the scenes of violence and topics covered (anarchy, experimentation in human subjects) were not common in animation by 1988 (at least in western animation, which is the one I am familiar with), which is probably also one of things that makes it a hallmark in animation. However, after watching the movie, I was never too engaged with the plot. In my opinion, there were too many things going at the same time (the fight of Kei's revolutionary group, what was the whole point of the ester's, the concept of the internal energy in every human) that did not allow me to focus in any of them, so I felt the narrative and the story a bit chopped. I know it might be because they tried to condensate a whole manga into a movie, but these should be 2 independent pieces of art, the movie should not rely on you reading the book to understand it, otherwise what is the point. Overall, I was not fully satisfied by the movie, making it an experience that I did not hate neither enjoy. (I learned also that I am not the biggest fan of Cyberpunk, as Akira belongs to this SciFi genre) Score (5)

    it is a long movie, and you will probably get a lil bored about half-way through, until the end, and the characters are weak in their storyline. this is mainly an action movie, but it seems like they also want it to be about the story-line. it could have been a lot better at building up the great story concept, and adding some more action scenes, but for 1988, this movie deserves a 10+. i give it a 7 or 6 for what i'm used to now, but i feel this IS a milestone for its time and every anime lover should have a copy) so if you don't mind looking back towards the past and watching a decent anime, this one is for ya. also...the front cover has a pic of a dude and a motorcycle and a picture of a pill on the back of his shirt. his motorcycle is hardly in the movie, and the pill pretty much is never seen in the movie, so i don't know how they come up with that. like i said, the story line is weak, and put together quite badly, but hey, it is 1988, and the graphics still look GREAT today)

    Akira is single worst film I have ever sit through. Manos: The Hands of Fate was far more entertaining and had better plot than this diarrhea of a film. It's badly written, loaded with pretense of being important and ugly. The very reason why this film is so loved and revered as a masterpiece is just baffling to me. Akira looks like a huge budget Troma animated film without the camp or their trademark humor. It's visually disgusting and repulsive to look at. Every other minute they feel the need add gore and loads of blood. The fluid animation is impressive and the detail is incredible but doesn't matter since everything else is terrible. The character designs look terrible and our two leads are completely indistinguishable from each other. Would have helped if they bothered with any means of character development or explaining who's who and what's their history. But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    Wow. OK so I'm a big anime fan, and I've always heard of this when the greatest anime movies were listed. It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed. Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it. It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater) Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece. 9/10

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    I remember seeing this in my teens and being distinctly underwhelmed. But Akira is a film whose stature has grown with time so I thought it would be worth another look in my thirties. It's taken me five days to get to the final third as I keep falling asleep. Many reviewers have commented on the beautiful animation that to me looks utterly average. Many have also mentioned the character development, which presumably impresses people who've never read a book. Still others praise the apocalyptic nature of Akira, which is never believable for an instant. Some decry the film for its gore content, which would at least have kept me awake. I guess I just don't get this kind of film. Seems to me like fodder for culture-starved teens and emotionally immature adults. Hmmmmmmm.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    In 1988 the animation audience were used to watch the same fairy tail since 1937 that Disney provided with 'snow white' where "happy and ever" ruled and there was no violence or anything to create a REAL climax between the characters with a good mix of blood and explosions. But that was until 1988. After Katsuhiro Otomo released his controversial "Akira" the world of animation realized that there was no limits for story or action to make a good movie. With a unusual and powerful story, combined with explosive actions sequences and outstanding visuals, Akira turns out to be one of the greatest animations ever made, and open the doors of this entire anime universe we have today.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    I remember seeing this in my teens and being distinctly underwhelmed. But Akira is a film whose stature has grown with time so I thought it would be worth another look in my thirties. It's taken me five days to get to the final third as I keep falling asleep. Many reviewers have commented on the beautiful animation that to me looks utterly average. Many have also mentioned the character development, which presumably impresses people who've never read a book. Still others praise the apocalyptic nature of Akira, which is never believable for an instant. Some decry the film for its gore content, which would at least have kept me awake. I guess I just don't get this kind of film. Seems to me like fodder for culture-starved teens and emotionally immature adults. Hmmmmmmm.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    In 1988 the animation audience were used to watch the same fairy tail since 1937 that Disney provided with 'snow white' where "happy and ever" ruled and there was no violence or anything to create a REAL climax between the characters with a good mix of blood and explosions. But that was until 1988. After Katsuhiro Otomo released his controversial "Akira" the world of animation realized that there was no limits for story or action to make a good movie. With a unusual and powerful story, combined with explosive actions sequences and outstanding visuals, Akira turns out to be one of the greatest animations ever made, and open the doors of this entire anime universe we have today.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

    (Dubbed version). I was really interested in watching "Akira", since everybody still mentions it as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, 25 years after its release (1988). You van definitely tell that the animation still looks pretty good, 25 years after. A lot of details in the backgrounds, and the way the main characters were draw. It is important to also mention, that the scenes of violence and topics covered (anarchy, experimentation in human subjects) were not common in animation by 1988 (at least in western animation, which is the one I am familiar with), which is probably also one of things that makes it a hallmark in animation. However, after watching the movie, I was never too engaged with the plot. In my opinion, there were too many things going at the same time (the fight of Kei's revolutionary group, what was the whole point of the ester's, the concept of the internal energy in every human) that did not allow me to focus in any of them, so I felt the narrative and the story a bit chopped. I know it might be because they tried to condensate a whole manga into a movie, but these should be 2 independent pieces of art, the movie should not rely on you reading the book to understand it, otherwise what is the point. Overall, I was not fully satisfied by the movie, making it an experience that I did not hate neither enjoy. (I learned also that I am not the biggest fan of Cyberpunk, as Akira belongs to this SciFi genre) Score (5)

    it is a long movie, and you will probably get a lil bored about half-way through, until the end, and the characters are weak in their storyline. this is mainly an action movie, but it seems like they also want it to be about the story-line. it could have been a lot better at building up the great story concept, and adding some more action scenes, but for 1988, this movie deserves a 10+. i give it a 7 or 6 for what i'm used to now, but i feel this IS a milestone for its time and every anime lover should have a copy) so if you don't mind looking back towards the past and watching a decent anime, this one is for ya. also...the front cover has a pic of a dude and a motorcycle and a picture of a pill on the back of his shirt. his motorcycle is hardly in the movie, and the pill pretty much is never seen in the movie, so i don't know how they come up with that. like i said, the story line is weak, and put together quite badly, but hey, it is 1988, and the graphics still look GREAT today)

    Akira is single worst film I have ever sit through. Manos: The Hands of Fate was far more entertaining and had better plot than this diarrhea of a film. It's badly written, loaded with pretense of being important and ugly. The very reason why this film is so loved and revered as a masterpiece is just baffling to me. Akira looks like a huge budget Troma animated film without the camp or their trademark humor. It's visually disgusting and repulsive to look at. Every other minute they feel the need add gore and loads of blood. The fluid animation is impressive and the detail is incredible but doesn't matter since everything else is terrible. The character designs look terrible and our two leads are completely indistinguishable from each other. Would have helped if they bothered with any means of character development or explaining who's who and what's their history. But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    Wow. OK so I'm a big anime fan, and I've always heard of this when the greatest anime movies were listed. It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed. Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it. It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater) Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece. 9/10

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    Wow. OK so I'm a big anime fan, and I've always heard of this when the greatest anime movies were listed. It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed. Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it. It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater) Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece. 9/10

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    I remember seeing this in my teens and being distinctly underwhelmed. But Akira is a film whose stature has grown with time so I thought it would be worth another look in my thirties. It's taken me five days to get to the final third as I keep falling asleep. Many reviewers have commented on the beautiful animation that to me looks utterly average. Many have also mentioned the character development, which presumably impresses people who've never read a book. Still others praise the apocalyptic nature of Akira, which is never believable for an instant. Some decry the film for its gore content, which would at least have kept me awake. I guess I just don't get this kind of film. Seems to me like fodder for culture-starved teens and emotionally immature adults. Hmmmmmmm.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    In 1988 the animation audience were used to watch the same fairy tail since 1937 that Disney provided with 'snow white' where "happy and ever" ruled and there was no violence or anything to create a REAL climax between the characters with a good mix of blood and explosions. But that was until 1988. After Katsuhiro Otomo released his controversial "Akira" the world of animation realized that there was no limits for story or action to make a good movie. With a unusual and powerful story, combined with explosive actions sequences and outstanding visuals, Akira turns out to be one of the greatest animations ever made, and open the doors of this entire anime universe we have today.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

    (Dubbed version). I was really interested in watching "Akira", since everybody still mentions it as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, 25 years after its release (1988). You van definitely tell that the animation still looks pretty good, 25 years after. A lot of details in the backgrounds, and the way the main characters were draw. It is important to also mention, that the scenes of violence and topics covered (anarchy, experimentation in human subjects) were not common in animation by 1988 (at least in western animation, which is the one I am familiar with), which is probably also one of things that makes it a hallmark in animation. However, after watching the movie, I was never too engaged with the plot. In my opinion, there were too many things going at the same time (the fight of Kei's revolutionary group, what was the whole point of the ester's, the concept of the internal energy in every human) that did not allow me to focus in any of them, so I felt the narrative and the story a bit chopped. I know it might be because they tried to condensate a whole manga into a movie, but these should be 2 independent pieces of art, the movie should not rely on you reading the book to understand it, otherwise what is the point. Overall, I was not fully satisfied by the movie, making it an experience that I did not hate neither enjoy. (I learned also that I am not the biggest fan of Cyberpunk, as Akira belongs to this SciFi genre) Score (5)

    it is a long movie, and you will probably get a lil bored about half-way through, until the end, and the characters are weak in their storyline. this is mainly an action movie, but it seems like they also want it to be about the story-line. it could have been a lot better at building up the great story concept, and adding some more action scenes, but for 1988, this movie deserves a 10+. i give it a 7 or 6 for what i'm used to now, but i feel this IS a milestone for its time and every anime lover should have a copy) so if you don't mind looking back towards the past and watching a decent anime, this one is for ya. also...the front cover has a pic of a dude and a motorcycle and a picture of a pill on the back of his shirt. his motorcycle is hardly in the movie, and the pill pretty much is never seen in the movie, so i don't know how they come up with that. like i said, the story line is weak, and put together quite badly, but hey, it is 1988, and the graphics still look GREAT today)

    Akira is single worst film I have ever sit through. Manos: The Hands of Fate was far more entertaining and had better plot than this diarrhea of a film. It's badly written, loaded with pretense of being important and ugly. The very reason why this film is so loved and revered as a masterpiece is just baffling to me. Akira looks like a huge budget Troma animated film without the camp or their trademark humor. It's visually disgusting and repulsive to look at. Every other minute they feel the need add gore and loads of blood. The fluid animation is impressive and the detail is incredible but doesn't matter since everything else is terrible. The character designs look terrible and our two leads are completely indistinguishable from each other. Would have helped if they bothered with any means of character development or explaining who's who and what's their history. But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    In 1988 the animation audience were used to watch the same fairy tail since 1937 that Disney provided with 'snow white' where "happy and ever" ruled and there was no violence or anything to create a REAL climax between the characters with a good mix of blood and explosions. But that was until 1988. After Katsuhiro Otomo released his controversial "Akira" the world of animation realized that there was no limits for story or action to make a good movie. With a unusual and powerful story, combined with explosive actions sequences and outstanding visuals, Akira turns out to be one of the greatest animations ever made, and open the doors of this entire anime universe we have today.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

    (Dubbed version). I was really interested in watching "Akira", since everybody still mentions it as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, 25 years after its release (1988). You van definitely tell that the animation still looks pretty good, 25 years after. A lot of details in the backgrounds, and the way the main characters were draw. It is important to also mention, that the scenes of violence and topics covered (anarchy, experimentation in human subjects) were not common in animation by 1988 (at least in western animation, which is the one I am familiar with), which is probably also one of things that makes it a hallmark in animation. However, after watching the movie, I was never too engaged with the plot. In my opinion, there were too many things going at the same time (the fight of Kei's revolutionary group, what was the whole point of the ester's, the concept of the internal energy in every human) that did not allow me to focus in any of them, so I felt the narrative and the story a bit chopped. I know it might be because they tried to condensate a whole manga into a movie, but these should be 2 independent pieces of art, the movie should not rely on you reading the book to understand it, otherwise what is the point. Overall, I was not fully satisfied by the movie, making it an experience that I did not hate neither enjoy. (I learned also that I am not the biggest fan of Cyberpunk, as Akira belongs to this SciFi genre) Score (5)

    it is a long movie, and you will probably get a lil bored about half-way through, until the end, and the characters are weak in their storyline. this is mainly an action movie, but it seems like they also want it to be about the story-line. it could have been a lot better at building up the great story concept, and adding some more action scenes, but for 1988, this movie deserves a 10+. i give it a 7 or 6 for what i'm used to now, but i feel this IS a milestone for its time and every anime lover should have a copy) so if you don't mind looking back towards the past and watching a decent anime, this one is for ya. also...the front cover has a pic of a dude and a motorcycle and a picture of a pill on the back of his shirt. his motorcycle is hardly in the movie, and the pill pretty much is never seen in the movie, so i don't know how they come up with that. like i said, the story line is weak, and put together quite badly, but hey, it is 1988, and the graphics still look GREAT today)

    Akira is single worst film I have ever sit through. Manos: The Hands of Fate was far more entertaining and had better plot than this diarrhea of a film. It's badly written, loaded with pretense of being important and ugly. The very reason why this film is so loved and revered as a masterpiece is just baffling to me. Akira looks like a huge budget Troma animated film without the camp or their trademark humor. It's visually disgusting and repulsive to look at. Every other minute they feel the need add gore and loads of blood. The fluid animation is impressive and the detail is incredible but doesn't matter since everything else is terrible. The character designs look terrible and our two leads are completely indistinguishable from each other. Would have helped if they bothered with any means of character development or explaining who's who and what's their history. But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    Wow. OK so I'm a big anime fan, and I've always heard of this when the greatest anime movies were listed. It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed. Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it. It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater) Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece. 9/10

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    I remember seeing this in my teens and being distinctly underwhelmed. But Akira is a film whose stature has grown with time so I thought it would be worth another look in my thirties. It's taken me five days to get to the final third as I keep falling asleep. Many reviewers have commented on the beautiful animation that to me looks utterly average. Many have also mentioned the character development, which presumably impresses people who've never read a book. Still others praise the apocalyptic nature of Akira, which is never believable for an instant. Some decry the film for its gore content, which would at least have kept me awake. I guess I just don't get this kind of film. Seems to me like fodder for culture-starved teens and emotionally immature adults. Hmmmmmmm.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

    Akira is single worst film I have ever sit through. Manos: The Hands of Fate was far more entertaining and had better plot than this diarrhea of a film. It's badly written, loaded with pretense of being important and ugly. The very reason why this film is so loved and revered as a masterpiece is just baffling to me. Akira looks like a huge budget Troma animated film without the camp or their trademark humor. It's visually disgusting and repulsive to look at. Every other minute they feel the need add gore and loads of blood. The fluid animation is impressive and the detail is incredible but doesn't matter since everything else is terrible. The character designs look terrible and our two leads are completely indistinguishable from each other. Would have helped if they bothered with any means of character development or explaining who's who and what's their history. But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    I remember seeing this in my teens and being distinctly underwhelmed. But Akira is a film whose stature has grown with time so I thought it would be worth another look in my thirties. It's taken me five days to get to the final third as I keep falling asleep. Many reviewers have commented on the beautiful animation that to me looks utterly average. Many have also mentioned the character development, which presumably impresses people who've never read a book. Still others praise the apocalyptic nature of Akira, which is never believable for an instant. Some decry the film for its gore content, which would at least have kept me awake. I guess I just don't get this kind of film. Seems to me like fodder for culture-starved teens and emotionally immature adults. Hmmmmmmm.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    In 1988 the animation audience were used to watch the same fairy tail since 1937 that Disney provided with 'snow white' where "happy and ever" ruled and there was no violence or anything to create a REAL climax between the characters with a good mix of blood and explosions. But that was until 1988. After Katsuhiro Otomo released his controversial "Akira" the world of animation realized that there was no limits for story or action to make a good movie. With a unusual and powerful story, combined with explosive actions sequences and outstanding visuals, Akira turns out to be one of the greatest animations ever made, and open the doors of this entire anime universe we have today.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

    (Dubbed version). I was really interested in watching "Akira", since everybody still mentions it as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, 25 years after its release (1988). You van definitely tell that the animation still looks pretty good, 25 years after. A lot of details in the backgrounds, and the way the main characters were draw. It is important to also mention, that the scenes of violence and topics covered (anarchy, experimentation in human subjects) were not common in animation by 1988 (at least in western animation, which is the one I am familiar with), which is probably also one of things that makes it a hallmark in animation. However, after watching the movie, I was never too engaged with the plot. In my opinion, there were too many things going at the same time (the fight of Kei's revolutionary group, what was the whole point of the ester's, the concept of the internal energy in every human) that did not allow me to focus in any of them, so I felt the narrative and the story a bit chopped. I know it might be because they tried to condensate a whole manga into a movie, but these should be 2 independent pieces of art, the movie should not rely on you reading the book to understand it, otherwise what is the point. Overall, I was not fully satisfied by the movie, making it an experience that I did not hate neither enjoy. (I learned also that I am not the biggest fan of Cyberpunk, as Akira belongs to this SciFi genre) Score (5)

    it is a long movie, and you will probably get a lil bored about half-way through, until the end, and the characters are weak in their storyline. this is mainly an action movie, but it seems like they also want it to be about the story-line. it could have been a lot better at building up the great story concept, and adding some more action scenes, but for 1988, this movie deserves a 10+. i give it a 7 or 6 for what i'm used to now, but i feel this IS a milestone for its time and every anime lover should have a copy) so if you don't mind looking back towards the past and watching a decent anime, this one is for ya. also...the front cover has a pic of a dude and a motorcycle and a picture of a pill on the back of his shirt. his motorcycle is hardly in the movie, and the pill pretty much is never seen in the movie, so i don't know how they come up with that. like i said, the story line is weak, and put together quite badly, but hey, it is 1988, and the graphics still look GREAT today)

    Akira is single worst film I have ever sit through. Manos: The Hands of Fate was far more entertaining and had better plot than this diarrhea of a film. It's badly written, loaded with pretense of being important and ugly. The very reason why this film is so loved and revered as a masterpiece is just baffling to me. Akira looks like a huge budget Troma animated film without the camp or their trademark humor. It's visually disgusting and repulsive to look at. Every other minute they feel the need add gore and loads of blood. The fluid animation is impressive and the detail is incredible but doesn't matter since everything else is terrible. The character designs look terrible and our two leads are completely indistinguishable from each other. Would have helped if they bothered with any means of character development or explaining who's who and what's their history. But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    Wow. OK so I'm a big anime fan, and I've always heard of this when the greatest anime movies were listed. It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed. Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it. It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater) Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece. 9/10

    "Akira" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s. The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a "giant, glowing ball". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world... This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children. The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga. Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like "Shadow Skill", "Venus Wars" and "Ninja Scroll" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with "Golgo 13" and "Venus Wars". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo. Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched "Akira" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-) Other violent, epic anime films include "Fist of the North Star", "Golgo 13", "Ninja Scroll", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Wicked City" and the three "Violence Jack" OVAs.

    I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best. First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves. Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the "bad guys" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk.

    The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating. Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story. The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour. One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.

    From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on. The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo. In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.

    it is a long movie, and you will probably get a lil bored about half-way through, until the end, and the characters are weak in their storyline. this is mainly an action movie, but it seems like they also want it to be about the story-line. it could have been a lot better at building up the great story concept, and adding some more action scenes, but for 1988, this movie deserves a 10+. i give it a 7 or 6 for what i'm used to now, but i feel this IS a milestone for its time and every anime lover should have a copy) so if you don't mind looking back towards the past and watching a decent anime, this one is for ya. also...the front cover has a pic of a dude and a motorcycle and a picture of a pill on the back of his shirt. his motorcycle is hardly in the movie, and the pill pretty much is never seen in the movie, so i don't know how they come up with that. like i said, the story line is weak, and put together quite badly, but hey, it is 1988, and the graphics still look GREAT today)

    Akira is single worst film I have ever sit through. Manos: The Hands of Fate was far more entertaining and had better plot than this diarrhea of a film. It's badly written, loaded with pretense of being important and ugly. The very reason why this film is so loved and revered as a masterpiece is just baffling to me. Akira looks like a huge budget Troma animated film without the camp or their trademark humor. It's visually disgusting and repulsive to look at. Every other minute they feel the need add gore and loads of blood. The fluid animation is impressive and the detail is incredible but doesn't matter since everything else is terrible. The character designs look terrible and our two leads are completely indistinguishable from each other. Would have helped if they bothered with any means of character development or explaining who's who and what's their history. But it seemed that they just all wanted to show loads of gore and explosions without context and thought that major public wouldn't care. The script is an incomprehensible mess and leaves the majority of the audience confused. Nothing is explained and all the characters are paper thin caricatures of anime stereotypes. By far the most offensive being Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend. She is beaten and almost raped at first 20 minutes, without ever being given an background and then hour and a half later she is squished into a bloody pulp because life sucks. This is textbook example of sexist, misogynist writers doing everything to let the guys to fight the battle, because women are weak and they get in the way of melodrama. To make it worse, she is the weak girl who can't live without her boyfriend and has no brains of her own. Akira has some of the worst and most offensive characterizations I have seen in a big budget production. And then we get to the social commentary part of this fecal matter. The stories made about juvenile crime and teenagers revolting against adults in Japan, is one of the worst themes you can use in films, period. Especially if you have the level of subtly of 1950's American educational films. This whole idea, just like in Battle Royale, reeks of angry old man, upset at the youth and yelling "Get off my Lawn you damn kids!". Why do I despise this trend in Japanese cinema and TV? It's very simple - 9 cases out 10 it's a film, anime or book about killing teenagers by using well masked science fiction, fantasy of cop film premise. And most of these stories are played from the perspective of despicable, completely unlikable scumbags and fragile little girls to raped, assaulted and murdered. In other words, everything that Akira tries to say is complete nonsense and lost in all the violence, sleaze and obscenities which they like to show us. You can't tell complex stories and expect the audience to take it seriously, when your violence and gore matches the levels of Toxic Avenger and Braindead. When this starts to happen you have officially lost your right to be taken seriously. Especially when the last half hour looks like DragonBall Z... I hate and despise Akira and it's the very worst film I have ever seen. Manos: Hands of Fate, Dragon Wars, My Sassy Girl remake, Revolver, Swept Away, Exterminating Angels, The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot, Zero Dark Thirty, Savages, Superbad, Troy, Batman Forever, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Solaris remake, Star Trek V, Full Contact, Zardoz, Cloud Atlas, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, The Host, Sucker Punch, Kill Bill, Death Proof, Transformers 1-3, Garden State, Lake House, Natural Born Killers, Battle Royale, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I Saw the Devil, Ju Dou, Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa, Prometheus, Moonrise Kingdom, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Moonraker, The Ring didn't *beep* me off as much as Akira did. And I congratulate it for exceeding my expectations. Save your time and money and watch some good Anime instead of this turd. There are plenty of decent cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic anime like Cowboy Bepob, Wolfs Rain or just about anything else. It's not worth seeing and copies of it should be burned.

    Wow. OK so I'm a big anime fan, and I've always heard of this when the greatest anime movies were listed. It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed. Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it. It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater) Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece. 9/10
