 <sinopse>
  In this live-action feature of the cartoon show, Fred Flintstone finally gets the job he's always wanted, but it may just come at a price.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The Flintstones and the Rubbles are modern stone-age families. Fred and Barney work at Slate and Company, mining rock. Fred gives Barney some money so he and Betty can adopt a baby. When Fred and Barney take a test to determine who should become the new associate vice president, Barney returns the favor by switching his test answers for Fred's, whose answers aren't very good. Fred gets the executive position, but little realizes that he's being manipulated by Cliff Vandercave to be the fall guy for an embezzlement scheme.

    This is a live action take on the classic cartoon. I actually like the visual styles. It's got the crazy rock look. But they needed more colors and brighter colors. When Fred (John Goodman) gets promoted, evil sleazy executive Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) sees a stupid patsy to take the blame for his embezzling scheme. First Fred is forced to fire Barney (Rick Moranis), then the rest of the employees. Then he signs all kinds of memos without reading them. It all comes back to haunt him when the embezzling comes to light. The story is too serious. Not only is there scheming, but also fighting, firing people, money troubles and kidnapping. It's a children's cartoon. There is too much danger especially for the kids. It needs to be much lighter.

    Maybe a live action version of the old cartoon could have worked, but on this evidence, probably not. Over the years the screenplay had been worked over by almost every screenwriter alive, which has left us with an overly complicated plot involving corporate shenanigans and embezzlement but not many jokes; it's hard to get enthusiastic about the recreation of the famous title sequence and other references, or gags about 'Steven Spielrock'. A game (and, Rosie O'Donnell aside, spot on) cast certainly try their best but this is thin - not to mention pointless - stuff. It doesn't help that Bedrock has been brought to the screen as a kind of day-glo, polystyrene theme park; I know this isn't exactly a documentary but it would help if the rocks looked like rocks. Oh, who cares?

    I really enjoy John Goodman and have seen most of what he has done. Therefor, I wanted to see this film due to him being in it and because the Flintstones take me back. I think the film was o.k. The set design was great and nobody else could play Fred. Rick Moranis and Elizabeth Perkins were great for their parts too. Rosie O'Donnell shouldn't be in any movie. Ugh. The plot was transparent, but good acting and nostalgia kept me interested. I liked the animatronics in the film. They were very good for the time and Steven Spielberg is a master. The details in the backgrounds were very good. The Flintstones is a movie done well, but it is still a movie about the Flintstones and that's why it wont ever have a high rating. If John Goodman wasn't in this film, I probably wouldn't ever watch it, but that's just me. I would say watch the film, but don't spend money on it.

    When this film was released nearly twenty years ago, I was expecting an animated cartoon film since the kids toys being released through McDonald's looked cartoonish. It was a pretty good film being live action, even spawning a sequel six years later. I like that John Goodman plays Fred Flintstone, it was a great fit for him after "Roseanne." And the fact that Rick Moranis plays Barney is somewhat out of place, after seeing him in "Ghostbusters" and the Shrunk series. However, the film was very entertaining and I enjoy to watch the film to this day. Watching it takes you back to better times.

    The Flintstones is a live-action alteration of the '60s cartoon that does not remain too proper to the original animated series. The movie doesn't do a very well job in incorporating Bedrock and its world into the story or the viewing of the movie as it attempts to expand on the original cartoon without having all too much creativity, BUUUUT, it's still very good, and it's still a very lovely family adventure. I love the Flintstones movie. The Flintstones is amusingly funny all the way through with a likable story and a friendly disposition. The Flintstones has pleasant visuals; it has greatly glamorous sets as it is wondrously colorful. The interactive Bedrock environments are really solid. The cast is full of chiseled actors, well....okay, it's a really good cast. John Goodman plays a great Fred Flintstone. Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins are both fine as Fred and Wilma Flintstone. Rick Moranis is really good in a poorly written Barney Rubble character, and Rosie O'Donnell is pissy and not good as she struggles in what's supposed to be a sweet Betty Rubble character. This is a likable Kyle MacLachlan role as he's good in a consistently well-written villain character, but I have yet to ever take notice of MacLachlan while I am watching the Flintstones. Holy smokes! Hello, Halle Berry! My goodness! You're scorchingly beautiful! Wow! Miss Halle Berry as Miss Stone is smoking hot! My God! Look at her! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is so rocking hot beyond belief! Bamm-Bamm! The hottest girl in history! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is melting me with her fire! Oh my! Sweet Halle! Halle as Miss Stone gives one of the sexiest flirtatious jobs I've ever seen! Yabba dabba do! Halle Berry is unbelievable as she gives an all-time lovely performance. The Flintstones serves as a launching pad to Halle's destined superstardom. Berry blatantly owns this movie from beginning to end, and Halle is so clearly the great standout star of The Flintstones, not so much in an 'everybody else is bad she's so great' kind of a way but more so in an 'everybody's so good oh she's so very good' kind of way. Berry's amazing. It's more than just my imagination, Berry's scenes are just better; maybe it's her performance, maybe it's her bodacious body in that dress. Her scenes were meant to serve as a sweet getaway so that the audience could get lost in Halle's gorgeous eyes, and her freakishly fine physique for some time, but they actually serve as critical plot points. Halle has all the best parts. Miss Stone is a respectable and an elegant written character. Stone is the heroine of The Flintstones, and Halle's the heroine of my heart. I love Halle so. The lovely Elizabeth Taylor appears in her farewell performance and she's...so lovely. She's too great a choice to play Fred's mother-in-law; I'm grateful Taylor decided to do the role. Elizabeth brings real life to the character. The Flintstones is a gay old time. It's very good family fun that earns a good 6 graciously attributed to the perfect performance from the irresistibly sexy Halle Berry.

She does not portray Betty very well, but the rest of the cast were actually very good. I was particularly fond of Wilma's Mother! She was funny! What are these people complaining about, exactly!? I think it's a great family film that can be enjoyed by both - kids and adults alike.

    Years ago, there was a fad in Hollywood for making live-action adaptations of old cartoons. Most if not all of these live-action adaptations didn't work. This movie is one such instance. Yes, it tried to stick to the spirit of the old series, plus adding a few new jokes, such as a volcanic eruption closing a highway forever (and that type of event being considered routine). But the main joke of the cartoon was the idea of using animals in clever ways, such as a bird for a factory whistle or dinosaurs for construction machines. This idea worked as an animated cartoon. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same, or as effective, using animatronic animals. The other effects, such as Slate's stone spectacles, also didn't really work in live action either. The actors did okay, though Rosie O'Donnell was the worst choice possible for Betty Rubble. The story is a standard Flintstones-type plot: evil manipulators try to loot Fred's employer, and as part of the plot, Fred is promoted to a high office in the company, and Fred is too stupid to realize he is being used. Recommended for Flintstones completists only.

    I will confess and say that I was never a fan of the original Flintstones cartoon. I'm usually the one to jump on board and support poorly animated shows from the dawn of animated programs, but The Flintstones never resonated to me as anything more than a one note joke breathlessly carried out for an overwhelming one hundred and sixty-six shorts. Its setups were tired, its jokes clich&eacute;, and its characters bland and one dimensional. The film adaptation is more of the same, with one gleaming flaw from the start; its live action transfer. May I ask why? Why does the film industry continue to force programs that were born to be animated into the live action format. A way to save money is my only guess. But if you would stick to the old animation, wouldn't more people show up? Bottom line; The Flintstones was cheesy and completely cartoony with its slapstick, its ridiculous use of dinosaurs and prehistoric lifeforms as common household appliances, and its more subtle quirks that made the show memorable. All of those worked because it was all animated - you could never envision this happening in real life. Why would you want to? Our story begins with Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) discussing to a co-worker how he plans to take over the company Slate & Co. by looking like he is working hard on improving it while he is simultaneously shafting it out of much-needed cash. He plans on using Fred Flintstone in order to carry out this plan. Fred is played by John Goodman and his best pal Barney is played by Rick Moranis. To be fair, both men inhabit their roles nicely. Goodman is the go-to man to play Fred and while Moranis seems to not be built like the cartoon Barney, one must recognize that he does a faithful job at bringing the character to life. The same can be said for Elizabeth Perkins, playing Wilma, Fred's long-suffering wife, but the same can not be said for the woefully miscast Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, Barney's wife. One look at the cartoon Betty and Rosie O'Donnell and the resemblance is far beyond distant. Basically, Fred gets appointed the honorable job of being the vice president of Slate & Co. and it comes as no surprise that he lets the power get to his head and shortchanges his best friend Barney which starts by firing him. From there, it's all clich&eacute; best friend breakup arguments, tired sight gags, and a helluva lot of unfunny rock puns. The set design, at first, is welcoming and nice to look at. But after ninety long minutes of staring at rock buildings, CGI dinosaurs, and poorly crafted slapstick jokes, the endeavor goes from welcoming to downright bloated. The CGI, just as well, is uninspired, especially on Dino, who goes down as one of the most incessant and unnecessary characters of this decade. He's buffoonish, annoying, and transfers about as well to the big screen as Scooby-Doo did in 2002. The Flintstones is a rather monotonous adventure, much like how the show was. Its jokes become stale too quickly, its premise is dated (not pun intended), and even the slightly humorous little tidbits such as the creatures of Bedrock working as household appliances becomes unfunny because of the way they look in the film. Also, the film's concern with plot points that are likely not appealing to kids (or even adults in that respect) can't rebound the film's already ridiculous setup and ideas. Starring: John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, Rosie O'Donnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    Years ago, there was a fad in Hollywood for making live-action adaptations of old cartoons. Most if not all of these live-action adaptations didn't work. This movie is one such instance. Yes, it tried to stick to the spirit of the old series, plus adding a few new jokes, such as a volcanic eruption closing a highway forever (and that type of event being considered routine). But the main joke of the cartoon was the idea of using animals in clever ways, such as a bird for a factory whistle or dinosaurs for construction machines. This idea worked as an animated cartoon. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same, or as effective, using animatronic animals. The other effects, such as Slate's stone spectacles, also didn't really work in live action either. The actors did okay, though Rosie O'Donnell was the worst choice possible for Betty Rubble. The story is a standard Flintstones-type plot: evil manipulators try to loot Fred's employer, and as part of the plot, Fred is promoted to a high office in the company, and Fred is too stupid to realize he is being used. Recommended for Flintstones completists only.

    I will confess and say that I was never a fan of the original Flintstones cartoon. I'm usually the one to jump on board and support poorly animated shows from the dawn of animated programs, but The Flintstones never resonated to me as anything more than a one note joke breathlessly carried out for an overwhelming one hundred and sixty-six shorts. Its setups were tired, its jokes clich&eacute;, and its characters bland and one dimensional. The film adaptation is more of the same, with one gleaming flaw from the start; its live action transfer. May I ask why? Why does the film industry continue to force programs that were born to be animated into the live action format. A way to save money is my only guess. But if you would stick to the old animation, wouldn't more people show up? Bottom line; The Flintstones was cheesy and completely cartoony with its slapstick, its ridiculous use of dinosaurs and prehistoric lifeforms as common household appliances, and its more subtle quirks that made the show memorable. All of those worked because it was all animated - you could never envision this happening in real life. Why would you want to? Our story begins with Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) discussing to a co-worker how he plans to take over the company Slate & Co. by looking like he is working hard on improving it while he is simultaneously shafting it out of much-needed cash. He plans on using Fred Flintstone in order to carry out this plan. Fred is played by John Goodman and his best pal Barney is played by Rick Moranis. To be fair, both men inhabit their roles nicely. Goodman is the go-to man to play Fred and while Moranis seems to not be built like the cartoon Barney, one must recognize that he does a faithful job at bringing the character to life. The same can be said for Elizabeth Perkins, playing Wilma, Fred's long-suffering wife, but the same can not be said for the woefully miscast Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, Barney's wife. One look at the cartoon Betty and Rosie O'Donnell and the resemblance is far beyond distant. Basically, Fred gets appointed the honorable job of being the vice president of Slate & Co. and it comes as no surprise that he lets the power get to his head and shortchanges his best friend Barney which starts by firing him. From there, it's all clich&eacute; best friend breakup arguments, tired sight gags, and a helluva lot of unfunny rock puns. The set design, at first, is welcoming and nice to look at. But after ninety long minutes of staring at rock buildings, CGI dinosaurs, and poorly crafted slapstick jokes, the endeavor goes from welcoming to downright bloated. The CGI, just as well, is uninspired, especially on Dino, who goes down as one of the most incessant and unnecessary characters of this decade. He's buffoonish, annoying, and transfers about as well to the big screen as Scooby-Doo did in 2002. The Flintstones is a rather monotonous adventure, much like how the show was. Its jokes become stale too quickly, its premise is dated (not pun intended), and even the slightly humorous little tidbits such as the creatures of Bedrock working as household appliances becomes unfunny because of the way they look in the film. Also, the film's concern with plot points that are likely not appealing to kids (or even adults in that respect) can't rebound the film's already ridiculous setup and ideas. Starring: John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, Rosie O'Donnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    This is a live action take on the classic cartoon. I actually like the visual styles. It's got the crazy rock look. But they needed more colors and brighter colors. When Fred (John Goodman) gets promoted, evil sleazy executive Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) sees a stupid patsy to take the blame for his embezzling scheme. First Fred is forced to fire Barney (Rick Moranis), then the rest of the employees. Then he signs all kinds of memos without reading them. It all comes back to haunt him when the embezzling comes to light. The story is too serious. Not only is there scheming, but also fighting, firing people, money troubles and kidnapping. It's a children's cartoon. There is too much danger especially for the kids. It needs to be much lighter.

    Maybe a live action version of the old cartoon could have worked, but on this evidence, probably not. Over the years the screenplay had been worked over by almost every screenwriter alive, which has left us with an overly complicated plot involving corporate shenanigans and embezzlement but not many jokes; it's hard to get enthusiastic about the recreation of the famous title sequence and other references, or gags about 'Steven Spielrock'. A game (and, Rosie O'Donnell aside, spot on) cast certainly try their best but this is thin - not to mention pointless - stuff. It doesn't help that Bedrock has been brought to the screen as a kind of day-glo, polystyrene theme park; I know this isn't exactly a documentary but it would help if the rocks looked like rocks. Oh, who cares?

    I really enjoy John Goodman and have seen most of what he has done. Therefor, I wanted to see this film due to him being in it and because the Flintstones take me back. I think the film was o.k. The set design was great and nobody else could play Fred. Rick Moranis and Elizabeth Perkins were great for their parts too. Rosie O'Donnell shouldn't be in any movie. Ugh. The plot was transparent, but good acting and nostalgia kept me interested. I liked the animatronics in the film. They were very good for the time and Steven Spielberg is a master. The details in the backgrounds were very good. The Flintstones is a movie done well, but it is still a movie about the Flintstones and that's why it wont ever have a high rating. If John Goodman wasn't in this film, I probably wouldn't ever watch it, but that's just me. I would say watch the film, but don't spend money on it.

    When this film was released nearly twenty years ago, I was expecting an animated cartoon film since the kids toys being released through McDonald's looked cartoonish. It was a pretty good film being live action, even spawning a sequel six years later. I like that John Goodman plays Fred Flintstone, it was a great fit for him after "Roseanne." And the fact that Rick Moranis plays Barney is somewhat out of place, after seeing him in "Ghostbusters" and the Shrunk series. However, the film was very entertaining and I enjoy to watch the film to this day. Watching it takes you back to better times.

    The Flintstones is a live-action alteration of the '60s cartoon that does not remain too proper to the original animated series. The movie doesn't do a very well job in incorporating Bedrock and its world into the story or the viewing of the movie as it attempts to expand on the original cartoon without having all too much creativity, BUUUUT, it's still very good, and it's still a very lovely family adventure. I love the Flintstones movie. The Flintstones is amusingly funny all the way through with a likable story and a friendly disposition. The Flintstones has pleasant visuals; it has greatly glamorous sets as it is wondrously colorful. The interactive Bedrock environments are really solid. The cast is full of chiseled actors, well....okay, it's a really good cast. John Goodman plays a great Fred Flintstone. Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins are both fine as Fred and Wilma Flintstone. Rick Moranis is really good in a poorly written Barney Rubble character, and Rosie O'Donnell is pissy and not good as she struggles in what's supposed to be a sweet Betty Rubble character. This is a likable Kyle MacLachlan role as he's good in a consistently well-written villain character, but I have yet to ever take notice of MacLachlan while I am watching the Flintstones. Holy smokes! Hello, Halle Berry! My goodness! You're scorchingly beautiful! Wow! Miss Halle Berry as Miss Stone is smoking hot! My God! Look at her! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is so rocking hot beyond belief! Bamm-Bamm! The hottest girl in history! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is melting me with her fire! Oh my! Sweet Halle! Halle as Miss Stone gives one of the sexiest flirtatious jobs I've ever seen! Yabba dabba do! Halle Berry is unbelievable as she gives an all-time lovely performance. The Flintstones serves as a launching pad to Halle's destined superstardom. Berry blatantly owns this movie from beginning to end, and Halle is so clearly the great standout star of The Flintstones, not so much in an 'everybody else is bad she's so great' kind of a way but more so in an 'everybody's so good oh she's so very good' kind of way. Berry's amazing. It's more than just my imagination, Berry's scenes are just better; maybe it's her performance, maybe it's her bodacious body in that dress. Her scenes were meant to serve as a sweet getaway so that the audience could get lost in Halle's gorgeous eyes, and her freakishly fine physique for some time, but they actually serve as critical plot points. Halle has all the best parts. Miss Stone is a respectable and an elegant written character. Stone is the heroine of The Flintstones, and Halle's the heroine of my heart. I love Halle so. The lovely Elizabeth Taylor appears in her farewell performance and she's...so lovely. She's too great a choice to play Fred's mother-in-law; I'm grateful Taylor decided to do the role. Elizabeth brings real life to the character. The Flintstones is a gay old time. It's very good family fun that earns a good 6 graciously attributed to the perfect performance from the irresistibly sexy Halle Berry.

    The Flintstones is a decent movie with a surprisingly clever story line,but only a alright cast,and most of them don't really relate to the characters their playing.If you grew up with the Flintstones,like myself,you will definitely be disappointed with this movie.I felt the only member of the cast who stayed true to his character was John Goodman,he sounded and behaved just like Fred Flintstone from the classic animated series.I didn't appreciate Rick Moranis,who sounded nothing like the original Barney Rubble,and I especially disliked Rosie O'Donnel,Betty Rubble is one of the most attractive cartoon characters ever,and then they get one of the ugliest characters in Hollywood to play her,that was a bad casting decision.I also didn't like Halle Berry,she was just thrown in to amuse the dads watching this with their kids,and her name literally being Sharon Stone was not at all funny. When Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) gives Barney (Rick Moranis) money so he can adopt a child,Barney gives Fred the opportunity of getting the job he has always wanted.

    It's current rating is 4.7, and I think it's unfair, so I'm giving it 10 stars. I would've probably rated it 7 out of 10 under normal circumstances, but I don't understand all the hate, and I think the current (very low) rating is undeserved, so... I don't get all the harsh criticism this movie has received. I, too, have watched the cartoon when I was a kid, and I do think this is a fairly good adaption. The movie is funny, original, and entertaining. It's a light-hearted comedy, which isn't meant to be serious or "realistic". It is what it is, and it serves it's purpose (to entertain and generate laughs) well enough by my standards. I did not think Rosie O'Donnell was a particularly good choice. She does not portray Betty very well, but the rest of the cast were actually very good. I was particularly fond of Wilma's Mother! She was funny! What are these people complaining about, exactly!? I think it's a great family film that can be enjoyed by both - kids and adults alike.

    Fred and Barney work at Slate and Company, mining rock. Fred gives Barney some money so he and Betty can adopt a baby. When Fred and Barney take a test to determine who should become the new associate vice president, Barney returns the favour by switching his test answers for Fred's, whose answers aren't very good. Fred gets the executive position, but little realises that he's being manipulated by Cliff Vandercave to be the fall guy for an embezzlement scheme..... As soon as the credits roll, you know that the makers are really trying too much to entertain the adults as much as the kids, and when Berry introduced herself as Sharon Stone, I gave up. It is faithful to the cartoon, and to be fair, the effects and the references to the cartoon are wondrous, and Bedrock really does come alive on the screen. Goodmaen is way over the top, but I don't believe there is any other way. The rest of the cast are just there, but Moranis is great and really shines in this. The plot is simple and straight forward, and it's as predictable as alway, friends fall out, argue for a while, hero gets the blame, every one hates him for a while, come the end, everyone is happy. It's not good, and it's not clever, just a tirade of product placement and silly references to adults. That made me grimace rather than smile.

    Years ago, there was a fad in Hollywood for making live-action adaptations of old cartoons. Most if not all of these live-action adaptations didn't work. This movie is one such instance. Yes, it tried to stick to the spirit of the old series, plus adding a few new jokes, such as a volcanic eruption closing a highway forever (and that type of event being considered routine). But the main joke of the cartoon was the idea of using animals in clever ways, such as a bird for a factory whistle or dinosaurs for construction machines. This idea worked as an animated cartoon. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same, or as effective, using animatronic animals. The other effects, such as Slate's stone spectacles, also didn't really work in live action either. The actors did okay, though Rosie O'Donnell was the worst choice possible for Betty Rubble. The story is a standard Flintstones-type plot: evil manipulators try to loot Fred's employer, and as part of the plot, Fred is promoted to a high office in the company, and Fred is too stupid to realize he is being used. Recommended for Flintstones completists only.

    I will confess and say that I was never a fan of the original Flintstones cartoon. I'm usually the one to jump on board and support poorly animated shows from the dawn of animated programs, but The Flintstones never resonated to me as anything more than a one note joke breathlessly carried out for an overwhelming one hundred and sixty-six shorts. Its setups were tired, its jokes clich&eacute;, and its characters bland and one dimensional. The film adaptation is more of the same, with one gleaming flaw from the start; its live action transfer. May I ask why? Why does the film industry continue to force programs that were born to be animated into the live action format. A way to save money is my only guess. But if you would stick to the old animation, wouldn't more people show up? Bottom line; The Flintstones was cheesy and completely cartoony with its slapstick, its ridiculous use of dinosaurs and prehistoric lifeforms as common household appliances, and its more subtle quirks that made the show memorable. All of those worked because it was all animated - you could never envision this happening in real life. Why would you want to? Our story begins with Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) discussing to a co-worker how he plans to take over the company Slate & Co. by looking like he is working hard on improving it while he is simultaneously shafting it out of much-needed cash.

The same can be said for Elizabeth Perkins, playing Wilma, Fred's long-suffering wife, but the same can not be said for the woefully miscast Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, Barney's wife. One look at the cartoon Betty and Rosie O'Donnell and the resemblance is far beyond distant. Basically, Fred gets appointed the honorable job of being the vice president of Slate & Co. and it comes as no surprise that he lets the power get to his head and shortchanges his best friend Barney which starts by firing him. From there, it's all clich&eacute; best friend breakup arguments, tired sight gags, and a helluva lot of unfunny rock puns. The set design, at first, is welcoming and nice to look at. But after ninety long minutes of staring at rock buildings, CGI dinosaurs, and poorly crafted slapstick jokes, the endeavor goes from welcoming to downright bloated. The CGI, just as well, is uninspired, especially on Dino, who goes down as one of the most incessant and unnecessary characters of this decade. He's buffoonish, annoying, and transfers about as well to the big screen as Scooby-Doo did in 2002. The Flintstones is a rather monotonous adventure, much like how the show was.

She does not portray Betty very well, but the rest of the cast were actually very good. I was particularly fond of Wilma's Mother! She was funny! What are these people complaining about, exactly!? I think it's a great family film that can be enjoyed by both - kids and adults alike.

    Fred and Barney work at Slate and Company, mining rock. Fred gives Barney some money so he and Betty can adopt a baby. When Fred and Barney take a test to determine who should become the new associate vice president, Barney returns the favour by switching his test answers for Fred's, whose answers aren't very good. Fred gets the executive position, but little realises that he's being manipulated by Cliff Vandercave to be the fall guy for an embezzlement scheme..... As soon as the credits roll, you know that the makers are really trying too much to entertain the adults as much as the kids, and when Berry introduced herself as Sharon Stone, I gave up. It is faithful to the cartoon, and to be fair, the effects and the references to the cartoon are wondrous, and Bedrock really does come alive on the screen. Goodmaen is way over the top, but I don't believe there is any other way. The rest of the cast are just there, but Moranis is great and really shines in this. The plot is simple and straight forward, and it's as predictable as alway, friends fall out, argue for a while, hero gets the blame, every one hates him for a while, come the end, everyone is happy. It's not good, and it's not clever, just a tirade of product placement and silly references to adults. That made me grimace rather than smile.

    Years ago, there was a fad in Hollywood for making live-action adaptations of old cartoons. Most if not all of these live-action adaptations didn't work. This movie is one such instance. Yes, it tried to stick to the spirit of the old series, plus adding a few new jokes, such as a volcanic eruption closing a highway forever (and that type of event being considered routine). But the main joke of the cartoon was the idea of using animals in clever ways, such as a bird for a factory whistle or dinosaurs for construction machines. This idea worked as an animated cartoon. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same, or as effective, using animatronic animals. The other effects, such as Slate's stone spectacles, also didn't really work in live action either. The actors did okay, though Rosie O'Donnell was the worst choice possible for Betty Rubble. The story is a standard Flintstones-type plot: evil manipulators try to loot Fred's employer, and as part of the plot, Fred is promoted to a high office in the company, and Fred is too stupid to realize he is being used. Recommended for Flintstones completists only.

    I will confess and say that I was never a fan of the original Flintstones cartoon. I'm usually the one to jump on board and support poorly animated shows from the dawn of animated programs, but The Flintstones never resonated to me as anything more than a one note joke breathlessly carried out for an overwhelming one hundred and sixty-six shorts. Its setups were tired, its jokes clich&eacute;, and its characters bland and one dimensional. The film adaptation is more of the same, with one gleaming flaw from the start; its live action transfer. May I ask why? Why does the film industry continue to force programs that were born to be animated into the live action format. A way to save money is my only guess. But if you would stick to the old animation, wouldn't more people show up? Bottom line; The Flintstones was cheesy and completely cartoony with its slapstick, its ridiculous use of dinosaurs and prehistoric lifeforms as common household appliances, and its more subtle quirks that made the show memorable. All of those worked because it was all animated - you could never envision this happening in real life. Why would you want to? Our story begins with Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) discussing to a co-worker how he plans to take over the company Slate & Co. by looking like he is working hard on improving it while he is simultaneously shafting it out of much-needed cash. He plans on using Fred Flintstone in order to carry out this plan. Fred is played by John Goodman and his best pal Barney is played by Rick Moranis. To be fair, both men inhabit their roles nicely. Goodman is the go-to man to play Fred and while Moranis seems to not be built like the cartoon Barney, one must recognize that he does a faithful job at bringing the character to life. The same can be said for Elizabeth Perkins, playing Wilma, Fred's long-suffering wife, but the same can not be said for the woefully miscast Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, Barney's wife. One look at the cartoon Betty and Rosie O'Donnell and the resemblance is far beyond distant. Basically, Fred gets appointed the honorable job of being the vice president of Slate & Co. and it comes as no surprise that he lets the power get to his head and shortchanges his best friend Barney which starts by firing him. From there, it's all clich&eacute; best friend breakup arguments, tired sight gags, and a helluva lot of unfunny rock puns. The set design, at first, is welcoming and nice to look at. But after ninety long minutes of staring at rock buildings, CGI dinosaurs, and poorly crafted slapstick jokes, the endeavor goes from welcoming to downright bloated. The CGI, just as well, is uninspired, especially on Dino, who goes down as one of the most incessant and unnecessary characters of this decade. He's buffoonish, annoying, and transfers about as well to the big screen as Scooby-Doo did in 2002. The Flintstones is a rather monotonous adventure, much like how the show was. Its jokes become stale too quickly, its premise is dated (not pun intended), and even the slightly humorous little tidbits such as the creatures of Bedrock working as household appliances becomes unfunny because of the way they look in the film. Also, the film's concern with plot points that are likely not appealing to kids (or even adults in that respect) can't rebound the film's already ridiculous setup and ideas. Starring: John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, Rosie O'Donnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    This is a live action take on the classic cartoon. I actually like the visual styles. It's got the crazy rock look. But they needed more colors and brighter colors. When Fred (John Goodman) gets promoted, evil sleazy executive Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) sees a stupid patsy to take the blame for his embezzling scheme. First Fred is forced to fire Barney (Rick Moranis), then the rest of the employees. Then he signs all kinds of memos without reading them. It all comes back to haunt him when the embezzling comes to light. The story is too serious. Not only is there scheming, but also fighting, firing people, money troubles and kidnapping. It's a children's cartoon. There is too much danger especially for the kids. It needs to be much lighter.

    Maybe a live action version of the old cartoon could have worked, but on this evidence, probably not. Over the years the screenplay had been worked over by almost every screenwriter alive, which has left us with an overly complicated plot involving corporate shenanigans and embezzlement but not many jokes; it's hard to get enthusiastic about the recreation of the famous title sequence and other references, or gags about 'Steven Spielrock'. A game (and, Rosie O'Donnell aside, spot on) cast certainly try their best but this is thin - not to mention pointless - stuff. It doesn't help that Bedrock has been brought to the screen as a kind of day-glo, polystyrene theme park; I know this isn't exactly a documentary but it would help if the rocks looked like rocks. Oh, who cares?

    I really enjoy John Goodman and have seen most of what he has done. Therefor, I wanted to see this film due to him being in it and because the Flintstones take me back. I think the film was o.k. The set design was great and nobody else could play Fred. Rick Moranis and Elizabeth Perkins were great for their parts too. Rosie O'Donnell shouldn't be in any movie. Ugh. The plot was transparent, but good acting and nostalgia kept me interested. I liked the animatronics in the film. They were very good for the time and Steven Spielberg is a master. The details in the backgrounds were very good. The Flintstones is a movie done well, but it is still a movie about the Flintstones and that's why it wont ever have a high rating. If John Goodman wasn't in this film, I probably wouldn't ever watch it, but that's just me. I would say watch the film, but don't spend money on it.

    When this film was released nearly twenty years ago, I was expecting an animated cartoon film since the kids toys being released through McDonald's looked cartoonish. It was a pretty good film being live action, even spawning a sequel six years later. I like that John Goodman plays Fred Flintstone, it was a great fit for him after "Roseanne." And the fact that Rick Moranis plays Barney is somewhat out of place, after seeing him in "Ghostbusters" and the Shrunk series. However, the film was very entertaining and I enjoy to watch the film to this day. Watching it takes you back to better times.

    The Flintstones is a live-action alteration of the '60s cartoon that does not remain too proper to the original animated series. The movie doesn't do a very well job in incorporating Bedrock and its world into the story or the viewing of the movie as it attempts to expand on the original cartoon without having all too much creativity, BUUUUT, it's still very good, and it's still a very lovely family adventure. I love the Flintstones movie. The Flintstones is amusingly funny all the way through with a likable story and a friendly disposition. The Flintstones has pleasant visuals; it has greatly glamorous sets as it is wondrously colorful. The interactive Bedrock environments are really solid. The cast is full of chiseled actors, well....okay, it's a really good cast. John Goodman plays a great Fred Flintstone. Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins are both fine as Fred and Wilma Flintstone. Rick Moranis is really good in a poorly written Barney Rubble character, and Rosie O'Donnell is pissy and not good as she struggles in what's supposed to be a sweet Betty Rubble character. This is a likable Kyle MacLachlan role as he's good in a consistently well-written villain character, but I have yet to ever take notice of MacLachlan while I am watching the Flintstones. Holy smokes! Hello, Halle Berry! My goodness! You're scorchingly beautiful! Wow! Miss Halle Berry as Miss Stone is smoking hot! My God! Look at her! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is so rocking hot beyond belief! Bamm-Bamm! The hottest girl in history! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is melting me with her fire! Oh my! Sweet Halle! Halle as Miss Stone gives one of the sexiest flirtatious jobs I've ever seen! Yabba dabba do! Halle Berry is unbelievable as she gives an all-time lovely performance. The Flintstones serves as a launching pad to Halle's destined superstardom. Berry blatantly owns this movie from beginning to end, and Halle is so clearly the great standout star of The Flintstones, not so much in an 'everybody else is bad she's so great' kind of a way but more so in an 'everybody's so good oh she's so very good' kind of way. Berry's amazing. It's more than just my imagination, Berry's scenes are just better; maybe it's her performance, maybe it's her bodacious body in that dress. Her scenes were meant to serve as a sweet getaway so that the audience could get lost in Halle's gorgeous eyes, and her freakishly fine physique for some time, but they actually serve as critical plot points. Halle has all the best parts. Miss Stone is a respectable and an elegant written character. Stone is the heroine of The Flintstones, and Halle's the heroine of my heart. I love Halle so. The lovely Elizabeth Taylor appears in her farewell performance and she's...so lovely. She's too great a choice to play Fred's mother-in-law; I'm grateful Taylor decided to do the role. Elizabeth brings real life to the character. The Flintstones is a gay old time. It's very good family fun that earns a good 6 graciously attributed to the perfect performance from the irresistibly sexy Halle Berry.

    The Flintstones is a decent movie with a surprisingly clever story line,but only a alright cast,and most of them don't really relate to the characters their playing.If you grew up with the Flintstones,like myself,you will definitely be disappointed with this movie.I felt the only member of the cast who stayed true to his character was John Goodman,he sounded and behaved just like Fred Flintstone from the classic animated series.I didn't appreciate Rick Moranis,who sounded nothing like the original Barney Rubble,and I especially disliked Rosie O'Donnel,Betty Rubble is one of the most attractive cartoon characters ever,and then they get one of the ugliest characters in Hollywood to play her,that was a bad casting decision.I also didn't like Halle Berry,she was just thrown in to amuse the dads watching this with their kids,and her name literally being Sharon Stone was not at all funny. When Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) gives Barney (Rick Moranis) money so he can adopt a child,Barney gives Fred the opportunity of getting the job he has always wanted.

    It's current rating is 4.7, and I think it's unfair, so I'm giving it 10 stars. I would've probably rated it 7 out of 10 under normal circumstances, but I don't understand all the hate, and I think the current (very low) rating is undeserved, so... I don't get all the harsh criticism this movie has received. I, too, have watched the cartoon when I was a kid, and I do think this is a fairly good adaption. The movie is funny, original, and entertaining. It's a light-hearted comedy, which isn't meant to be serious or "realistic". It is what it is, and it serves it's purpose (to entertain and generate laughs) well enough by my standards. I did not think Rosie O'Donnell was a particularly good choice. She does not portray Betty very well, but the rest of the cast were actually very good. I was particularly fond of Wilma's Mother! She was funny! What are these people complaining about, exactly!?

    Fred and Barney work at Slate and Company, mining rock. Fred gives Barney some money so he and Betty can adopt a baby. When Fred and Barney take a test to determine who should become the new associate vice president, Barney returns the favour by switching his test answers for Fred's, whose answers aren't very good. Fred gets the executive position, but little realises that he's being manipulated by Cliff Vandercave to be the fall guy for an embezzlement scheme..... As soon as the credits roll, you know that the makers are really trying too much to entertain the adults as much as the kids, and when Berry introduced herself as Sharon Stone, I gave up.

Goodmaen is way over the top, but I don't believe there is any other way. The rest of the cast are just there, but Moranis is great and really shines in this. The plot is simple and straight forward, and it's as predictable as alway, friends fall out, argue for a while, hero gets the blame, every one hates him for a while, come the end, everyone is happy. It's not good, and it's not clever, just a tirade of product placement and silly references to adults. That made me grimace rather than smile.

    The Flintstones is a decent movie with a surprisingly clever story line,but only a alright cast,and most of them don't really relate to the characters their playing.If you grew up with the Flintstones,like myself,you will definitely be disappointed with this movie.I felt the only member of the cast who stayed true to his character was John Goodman,he sounded and behaved just like Fred Flintstone from the classic animated series.I didn't appreciate Rick Moranis,who sounded nothing like the original Barney Rubble,and I especially disliked Rosie O'Donnel,Betty Rubble is one of the most attractive cartoon characters ever,and then they get one of the ugliest characters in Hollywood to play her,that was a bad casting decision.I also didn't like Halle Berry,she was just thrown in to amuse the dads watching this with their kids,and her name literally being Sharon Stone was not at all funny. When Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) gives Barney (Rick Moranis) money so he can adopt a child,Barney gives Fred the opportunity of getting the job he has always wanted.

    It's current rating is 4.7, and I think it's unfair, so I'm giving it 10 stars. I would've probably rated it 7 out of 10 under normal circumstances, but I don't understand all the hate, and I think the current (very low) rating is undeserved, so... I don't get all the harsh criticism this movie has received. I, too, have watched the cartoon when I was a kid, and I do think this is a fairly good adaption. The movie is funny, original, and entertaining. It's a light-hearted comedy, which isn't meant to be serious or "realistic". It is what it is, and it serves it's purpose (to entertain and generate laughs) well enough by my standards. I did not think Rosie O'Donnell was a particularly good choice. She does not portray Betty very well, but the rest of the cast were actually very good. I was particularly fond of Wilma's Mother! She was funny! What are these people complaining about, exactly!? I think it's a great family film that can be enjoyed by both - kids and adults alike.

    Fred and Barney work at Slate and Company, mining rock. Fred gives Barney some money so he and Betty can adopt a baby. When Fred and Barney take a test to determine who should become the new associate vice president, Barney returns the favour by switching his test answers for Fred's, whose answers aren't very good. Fred gets the executive position, but little realises that he's being manipulated by Cliff Vandercave to be the fall guy for an embezzlement scheme..... As soon as the credits roll, you know that the makers are really trying too much to entertain the adults as much as the kids, and when Berry introduced herself as Sharon Stone, I gave up. It is faithful to the cartoon, and to be fair, the effects and the references to the cartoon are wondrous, and Bedrock really does come alive on the screen. Goodmaen is way over the top, but I don't believe there is any other way. The rest of the cast are just there, but Moranis is great and really shines in this. The plot is simple and straight forward, and it's as predictable as alway, friends fall out, argue for a while, hero gets the blame, every one hates him for a while, come the end, everyone is happy. It's not good, and it's not clever, just a tirade of product placement and silly references to adults. That made me grimace rather than smile.

    Years ago, there was a fad in Hollywood for making live-action adaptations of old cartoons. Most if not all of these live-action adaptations didn't work. This movie is one such instance. Yes, it tried to stick to the spirit of the old series, plus adding a few new jokes, such as a volcanic eruption closing a highway forever (and that type of event being considered routine). But the main joke of the cartoon was the idea of using animals in clever ways, such as a bird for a factory whistle or dinosaurs for construction machines. This idea worked as an animated cartoon. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same, or as effective, using animatronic animals. The other effects, such as Slate's stone spectacles, also didn't really work in live action either. The actors did okay, though Rosie O'Donnell was the worst choice possible for Betty Rubble. The story is a standard Flintstones-type plot: evil manipulators try to loot Fred's employer, and as part of the plot, Fred is promoted to a high office in the company, and Fred is too stupid to realize he is being used. Recommended for Flintstones completists only.

    I will confess and say that I was never a fan of the original Flintstones cartoon. I'm usually the one to jump on board and support poorly animated shows from the dawn of animated programs, but The Flintstones never resonated to me as anything more than a one note joke breathlessly carried out for an overwhelming one hundred and sixty-six shorts. Its setups were tired, its jokes clich&eacute;, and its characters bland and one dimensional. The film adaptation is more of the same, with one gleaming flaw from the start; its live action transfer. May I ask why? Why does the film industry continue to force programs that were born to be animated into the live action format. A way to save money is my only guess. But if you would stick to the old animation, wouldn't more people show up? Bottom line; The Flintstones was cheesy and completely cartoony with its slapstick, its ridiculous use of dinosaurs and prehistoric lifeforms as common household appliances, and its more subtle quirks that made the show memorable. All of those worked because it was all animated - you could never envision this happening in real life. Why would you want to? Our story begins with Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) discussing to a co-worker how he plans to take over the company Slate & Co. by looking like he is working hard on improving it while he is simultaneously shafting it out of much-needed cash. He plans on using Fred Flintstone in order to carry out this plan. Fred is played by John Goodman and his best pal Barney is played by Rick Moranis. To be fair, both men inhabit their roles nicely. Goodman is the go-to man to play Fred and while Moranis seems to not be built like the cartoon Barney, one must recognize that he does a faithful job at bringing the character to life. The same can be said for Elizabeth Perkins, playing Wilma, Fred's long-suffering wife, but the same can not be said for the woefully miscast Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, Barney's wife. One look at the cartoon Betty and Rosie O'Donnell and the resemblance is far beyond distant. Basically, Fred gets appointed the honorable job of being the vice president of Slate & Co. and it comes as no surprise that he lets the power get to his head and shortchanges his best friend Barney which starts by firing him. From there, it's all clich&eacute; best friend breakup arguments, tired sight gags, and a helluva lot of unfunny rock puns. The set design, at first, is welcoming and nice to look at. But after ninety long minutes of staring at rock buildings, CGI dinosaurs, and poorly crafted slapstick jokes, the endeavor goes from welcoming to downright bloated. The CGI, just as well, is uninspired, especially on Dino, who goes down as one of the most incessant and unnecessary characters of this decade. He's buffoonish, annoying, and transfers about as well to the big screen as Scooby-Doo did in 2002. The Flintstones is a rather monotonous adventure, much like how the show was. Its jokes become stale too quickly, its premise is dated (not pun intended), and even the slightly humorous little tidbits such as the creatures of Bedrock working as household appliances becomes unfunny because of the way they look in the film. Also, the film's concern with plot points that are likely not appealing to kids (or even adults in that respect) can't rebound the film's already ridiculous setup and ideas. Starring: John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, Rosie O'Donnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    This is a live action take on the classic cartoon. I actually like the visual styles. It's got the crazy rock look. But they needed more colors and brighter colors. When Fred (John Goodman) gets promoted, evil sleazy executive Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) sees a stupid patsy to take the blame for his embezzling scheme. First Fred is forced to fire Barney (Rick Moranis), then the rest of the employees. Then he signs all kinds of memos without reading them. It all comes back to haunt him when the embezzling comes to light. The story is too serious. Not only is there scheming, but also fighting, firing people, money troubles and kidnapping. It's a children's cartoon. There is too much danger especially for the kids. It needs to be much lighter.

    Maybe a live action version of the old cartoon could have worked, but on this evidence, probably not. Over the years the screenplay had been worked over by almost every screenwriter alive, which has left us with an overly complicated plot involving corporate shenanigans and embezzlement but not many jokes; it's hard to get enthusiastic about the recreation of the famous title sequence and other references, or gags about 'Steven Spielrock'. A game (and, Rosie O'Donnell aside, spot on) cast certainly try their best but this is thin - not to mention pointless - stuff. It doesn't help that Bedrock has been brought to the screen as a kind of day-glo, polystyrene theme park; I know this isn't exactly a documentary but it would help if the rocks looked like rocks. Oh, who cares?

    I really enjoy John Goodman and have seen most of what he has done. Therefor, I wanted to see this film due to him being in it and because the Flintstones take me back. I think the film was o.k. The set design was great and nobody else could play Fred. Rick Moranis and Elizabeth Perkins were great for their parts too. Rosie O'Donnell shouldn't be in any movie. Ugh. The plot was transparent, but good acting and nostalgia kept me interested. I liked the animatronics in the film. They were very good for the time and Steven Spielberg is a master. The details in the backgrounds were very good. The Flintstones is a movie done well, but it is still a movie about the Flintstones and that's why it wont ever have a high rating. If John Goodman wasn't in this film, I probably wouldn't ever watch it, but that's just me. I would say watch the film, but don't spend money on it.

    When this film was released nearly twenty years ago, I was expecting an animated cartoon film since the kids toys being released through McDonald's looked cartoonish. It was a pretty good film being live action, even spawning a sequel six years later. I like that John Goodman plays Fred Flintstone, it was a great fit for him after "Roseanne." And the fact that Rick Moranis plays Barney is somewhat out of place, after seeing him in "Ghostbusters" and the Shrunk series. However, the film was very entertaining and I enjoy to watch the film to this day. Watching it takes you back to better times.

    The Flintstones is a live-action alteration of the '60s cartoon that does not remain too proper to the original animated series. The movie doesn't do a very well job in incorporating Bedrock and its world into the story or the viewing of the movie as it attempts to expand on the original cartoon without having all too much creativity, BUUUUT, it's still very good, and it's still a very lovely family adventure. I love the Flintstones movie. The Flintstones is amusingly funny all the way through with a likable story and a friendly disposition. The Flintstones has pleasant visuals; it has greatly glamorous sets as it is wondrously colorful. The interactive Bedrock environments are really solid. The cast is full of chiseled actors, well....okay, it's a really good cast. John Goodman plays a great Fred Flintstone. Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins are both fine as Fred and Wilma Flintstone. Rick Moranis is really good in a poorly written Barney Rubble character, and Rosie O'Donnell is pissy and not good as she struggles in what's supposed to be a sweet Betty Rubble character. This is a likable Kyle MacLachlan role as he's good in a consistently well-written villain character, but I have yet to ever take notice of MacLachlan while I am watching the Flintstones. Holy smokes! Hello, Halle Berry! My goodness! You're scorchingly beautiful! Wow! Miss Halle Berry as Miss Stone is smoking hot! My God! Look at her! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is so rocking hot beyond belief! Bamm-Bamm! The hottest girl in history! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is melting me with her fire! Oh my! Sweet Halle! Halle as Miss Stone gives one of the sexiest flirtatious jobs I've ever seen! Yabba dabba do! Halle Berry is unbelievable as she gives an all-time lovely performance. The Flintstones serves as a launching pad to Halle's destined superstardom. Berry blatantly owns this movie from beginning to end, and Halle is so clearly the great standout star of The Flintstones, not so much in an 'everybody else is bad she's so great' kind of a way but more so in an 'everybody's so good oh she's so very good' kind of way. Berry's amazing. It's more than just my imagination, Berry's scenes are just better; maybe it's her performance, maybe it's her bodacious body in that dress. Her scenes were meant to serve as a sweet getaway so that the audience could get lost in Halle's gorgeous eyes, and her freakishly fine physique for some time, but they actually serve as critical plot points. Halle has all the best parts. Miss Stone is a respectable and an elegant written character. Stone is the heroine of The Flintstones, and Halle's the heroine of my heart. I love Halle so. The lovely Elizabeth Taylor appears in her farewell performance and she's...so lovely. She's too great a choice to play Fred's mother-in-law; I'm grateful Taylor decided to do the role. Elizabeth brings real life to the character. The Flintstones is a gay old time. It's very good family fun that earns a good 6 graciously attributed to the perfect performance from the irresistibly sexy Halle Berry.

Rick Moranis is really good in a poorly written Barney Rubble character, and Rosie O'Donnell is pissy and not good as she struggles in what's supposed to be a sweet Betty Rubble character. This is a likable Kyle MacLachlan role as he's good in a consistently well-written villain character, but I have yet to ever take notice of MacLachlan while I am watching the Flintstones. Holy smokes! Hello, Halle Berry! My goodness! You're scorchingly beautiful! Wow! Miss Halle Berry as Miss Stone is smoking hot! My God! Look at her! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is so rocking hot beyond belief! Bamm-Bamm! The hottest girl in history! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is melting me with her fire! Oh my! Sweet Halle! Halle as Miss Stone gives one of the sexiest flirtatious jobs I've ever seen! Yabba dabba do! Halle Berry is unbelievable as she gives an all-time lovely performance. The Flintstones serves as a launching pad to Halle's destined superstardom. Berry blatantly owns this movie from beginning to end, and Halle is so clearly the great standout star of The Flintstones, not so much in an 'everybody else is bad she's so great' kind of a way but more so in an 'everybody's so good oh she's so very good' kind of way. Berry's amazing. It's more than just my imagination, Berry's scenes are just better; maybe it's her performance, maybe it's her bodacious body in that dress. Her scenes were meant to serve as a sweet getaway so that the audience could get lost in Halle's gorgeous eyes, and her freakishly fine physique for some time, but they actually serve as critical plot points. Halle has all the best parts. Miss Stone is a respectable and an elegant written character. Stone is the heroine of The Flintstones, and Halle's the heroine of my heart. I love Halle so. The lovely Elizabeth Taylor appears in her farewell performance and she's...so lovely. She's too great a choice to play Fred's mother-in-law; I'm grateful Taylor decided to do the role. Elizabeth brings real life to the character. The Flintstones is a gay old time. It's very good family fun that earns a good 6 graciously attributed to the perfect performance from the irresistibly sexy Halle Berry.

    The Flintstones is a decent movie with a surprisingly clever story line,but only a alright cast,and most of them don't really relate to the characters their playing.If you grew up with the Flintstones,like myself,you will definitely be disappointed with this movie.I felt the only member of the cast who stayed true to his character was John Goodman,he sounded and behaved just like Fred Flintstone from the classic animated series.I didn't appreciate Rick Moranis,who sounded nothing like the original Barney Rubble,and I especially disliked Rosie O'Donnel,Betty Rubble is one of the most attractive cartoon characters ever,and then they get one of the ugliest characters in Hollywood to play her,that was a bad casting decision.I also didn't like Halle Berry,she was just thrown in to amuse the dads watching this with their kids,and her name literally being Sharon Stone was not at all funny. When Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) gives Barney (Rick Moranis) money so he can adopt a child,Barney gives Fred the opportunity of getting the job he has always wanted.

    It's current rating is 4.7, and I think it's unfair, so I'm giving it 10 stars. I would've probably rated it 7 out of 10 under normal circumstances, but I don't understand all the hate, and I think the current (very low) rating is undeserved, so... I don't get all the harsh criticism this movie has received. I, too, have watched the cartoon when I was a kid, and I do think this is a fairly good adaption. The movie is funny, original, and entertaining. It's a light-hearted comedy, which isn't meant to be serious or "realistic". It is what it is, and it serves it's purpose (to entertain and generate laughs) well enough by my standards. I did not think Rosie O'Donnell was a particularly good choice. She does not portray Betty very well, but the rest of the cast were actually very good. I was particularly fond of Wilma's Mother! She was funny! What are these people complaining about, exactly!? I think it's a great family film that can be enjoyed by both - kids and adults alike.

    Fred and Barney work at Slate and Company, mining rock. Fred gives Barney some money so he and Betty can adopt a baby. When Fred and Barney take a test to determine who should become the new associate vice president, Barney returns the favour by switching his test answers for Fred's, whose answers aren't very good. Fred gets the executive position, but little realises that he's being manipulated by Cliff Vandercave to be the fall guy for an embezzlement scheme..... As soon as the credits roll, you know that the makers are really trying too much to entertain the adults as much as the kids, and when Berry introduced herself as Sharon Stone, I gave up. It is faithful to the cartoon, and to be fair, the effects and the references to the cartoon are wondrous, and Bedrock really does come alive on the screen. Goodmaen is way over the top, but I don't believe there is any other way. The rest of the cast are just there, but Moranis is great and really shines in this. The plot is simple and straight forward, and it's as predictable as alway, friends fall out, argue for a while, hero gets the blame, every one hates him for a while, come the end, everyone is happy. It's not good, and it's not clever, just a tirade of product placement and silly references to adults. That made me grimace rather than smile.

    Years ago, there was a fad in Hollywood for making live-action adaptations of old cartoons. Most if not all of these live-action adaptations didn't work. This movie is one such instance. Yes, it tried to stick to the spirit of the old series, plus adding a few new jokes, such as a volcanic eruption closing a highway forever (and that type of event being considered routine). But the main joke of the cartoon was the idea of using animals in clever ways, such as a bird for a factory whistle or dinosaurs for construction machines. This idea worked as an animated cartoon. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same, or as effective, using animatronic animals. The other effects, such as Slate's stone spectacles, also didn't really work in live action either. The actors did okay, though Rosie O'Donnell was the worst choice possible for Betty Rubble. The story is a standard Flintstones-type plot: evil manipulators try to loot Fred's employer, and as part of the plot, Fred is promoted to a high office in the company, and Fred is too stupid to realize he is being used. Recommended for Flintstones completists only.

    I will confess and say that I was never a fan of the original Flintstones cartoon. I'm usually the one to jump on board and support poorly animated shows from the dawn of animated programs, but The Flintstones never resonated to me as anything more than a one note joke breathlessly carried out for an overwhelming one hundred and sixty-six shorts. Its setups were tired, its jokes clich&eacute;, and its characters bland and one dimensional. The film adaptation is more of the same, with one gleaming flaw from the start; its live action transfer. May I ask why? Why does the film industry continue to force programs that were born to be animated into the live action format. A way to save money is my only guess. But if you would stick to the old animation, wouldn't more people show up? Bottom line; The Flintstones was cheesy and completely cartoony with its slapstick, its ridiculous use of dinosaurs and prehistoric lifeforms as common household appliances, and its more subtle quirks that made the show memorable. All of those worked because it was all animated - you could never envision this happening in real life. Why would you want to? Our story begins with Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) discussing to a co-worker how he plans to take over the company Slate & Co. by looking like he is working hard on improving it while he is simultaneously shafting it out of much-needed cash. He plans on using Fred Flintstone in order to carry out this plan. Fred is played by John Goodman and his best pal Barney is played by Rick Moranis. To be fair, both men inhabit their roles nicely. Goodman is the go-to man to play Fred and while Moranis seems to not be built like the cartoon Barney, one must recognize that he does a faithful job at bringing the character to life. The same can be said for Elizabeth Perkins, playing Wilma, Fred's long-suffering wife, but the same can not be said for the woefully miscast Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, Barney's wife. One look at the cartoon Betty and Rosie O'Donnell and the resemblance is far beyond distant. Basically, Fred gets appointed the honorable job of being the vice president of Slate & Co. and it comes as no surprise that he lets the power get to his head and shortchanges his best friend Barney which starts by firing him. From there, it's all clich&eacute; best friend breakup arguments, tired sight gags, and a helluva lot of unfunny rock puns. The set design, at first, is welcoming and nice to look at. But after ninety long minutes of staring at rock buildings, CGI dinosaurs, and poorly crafted slapstick jokes, the endeavor goes from welcoming to downright bloated. The CGI, just as well, is uninspired, especially on Dino, who goes down as one of the most incessant and unnecessary characters of this decade. He's buffoonish, annoying, and transfers about as well to the big screen as Scooby-Doo did in 2002. The Flintstones is a rather monotonous adventure, much like how the show was. Its jokes become stale too quickly, its premise is dated (not pun intended), and even the slightly humorous little tidbits such as the creatures of Bedrock working as household appliances becomes unfunny because of the way they look in the film. Also, the film's concern with plot points that are likely not appealing to kids (or even adults in that respect) can't rebound the film's already ridiculous setup and ideas. Starring: John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, Rosie O'Donnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. Directed by: Brian Levant.
