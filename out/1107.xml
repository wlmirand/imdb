    First review that I have given a perfect score to. This is an outstanding movie, well acted, directed, great story, great cinematography. A young women -Laura, excellently portrayed by Patricia Arquette, is encouraged by her sister to take a vacation in Rangoon to get over the devastating loss of her Husband and child. Its not long before she gets herself entwined in the true life battle between the Military dictatorship and the forces of democracy lead by Aung San Su Kyi. Kyi is leading a opposition to the Military rule in Burma (Now Myamar) and Laura goes and watches one of Kyi's speeches. Still not sure about what is going on, Laura is encouraged to take a visit to a village with a local guide. The guide turns out to be a key person in the resistance movement and is wanted by the Government. This movie is a must see movie.

    In the 90's, the American doctor Laura Bowman (Patricia Arquette) travels to Burma (presently Myanmar) with her sister and also doctor Andy Bowman (Frances McDormand) to recover from the loss of her beloved husband and son that were murdered in a theft at home. Laura sees a political pro-democracy manifestation to support the leader Aung San Suu Kyi and she decides to participate; however she loses her passport and she is not allowed to leave Rangoon. While waiting to have another flight, Laura meets the unofficial tourist guide U Aung Ko, who is also a leader of an underground movement, and she decides to visit the countryside of Burma. However, the military dictatorship represses the movement and Laura, U Aung Ko and several civilians try to escape to Thailand in a dangerous journey. "Beyond Rangoon" is an underrated film that has not aged, with top-notch performance of the gorgeous Patricia Arquette, I saw this film twice on VHS in the 90's and it is amazing that the military dictatorship still does exist in this country. In accordance with the statement of John Boorman in the Extras of the DVD, the dramatic scene when the commander orders to shoot the politician Aung San Suu Kyi did really happen. Aung San Suu Kyi won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and shamefully was only released from house arrest on 13 November 2010. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Muito Al&eacute;m de Rangum" ("Far Beyond Rangoon")

    This is a well made movie and is exciting. An American tourist gets caught up in a Burmese democracy uprising. Although filmed in Malaysia it has a good on location feel. Compared to "Cry Freedom" and "Killing Fields" it suffers a bit in credibility because it is a fictional story set in real life events as opposed to a totally true story. But because it is fiction it has a more of an intimate adventure feeling and you see things from her point of view. Patricia Arquette is good. She doesn't overact. The local cast is earnest and watchable. In the light of recent uprisings in the Middle East it is quite relevant today.

    This amazing film is probably the greatest triumph of John Boorman's long directing career. All the fire of his blazing courage and outrage are blended in this incredible portrayal of the dilemma of modern Burma. There is probably no military dictatorship anywhere in the world more brutal than that of Burma, which surpasses even the unlamented tyranny of Saddam Hussein for cruelty and sheer evil. It was like that when this film was made, and it is still like that now, 16 years later. Nothing has changed except that Aung San Suu Kyi is 16 years older. She is played delicately and to perfection in this film, in a brief and moving scene where she gracefully walks up to soldiers pointing rifles at her, brushes them aside, and passes on. In a sense, she is not just the Conscience of Burma but the current Conscience of the World. For she remains faithful to a cause which the world has heartlessly abandoned. Because there is no oil in Burma, it will not be invaded by the United States, Tony Blair will not go there with his pious platitudes and grin of a madman, BP will not ruin the coastline, and the arms industry must be content merely with selling guns for the population and 'rebels' to be murdered, not for invading troops to be opposed (what a pity there is less need for tanks and fighter planes, not to mention drones). Why is it that the Burmese population are so thoughtless that they allow themselves to be shot with simple rifle bullets, so that cannon shells are not required? The Burmese military really are bad customers, they kill on the cheap. But of course, like the Nazis, they get plenty of raping and torture in first, as what fun is it being a vicious brute if you cannot lord it over the people you are about to massacre before you do so? Even a Burmese soldier has his vanity. The most amazing performance in this film is by a Burmese man whose own name is the same as that of the character he plays, U Aung Ko. This is the only film in which he ever appeared, according to IMDb, so he was not an actor but 'a real person'. (Note: do real persons exist on screen outside of documentaries? This is an existential question for cin&eacute;astes.) In trying to find out more about this man, I googled the name and discovered that there is another U Aung Ko, actually U Aung Ko Win, also known as Saya Kyaung, who is closely connected with the present sinister regime, probably a relative but certainly not the same man as our hero in the film. Then I discovered that our hero lives in exile in Paris, having left Burma to live in France in 1975 (where he had previously studied at the Sorbonne), where he is married to a French woman, has assisted in the preparation of a documentary film about his country's plight, and works as a translator and language teacher. So that's who he is. The other lead in the film is Patricia Arquette, who gives a magnificently stalwart and powerful performance and clearly endured a great deal of physical hardship in doing so. The two of them work very well together and generate significant chemistry (not of the romantic kind but of the rarer kind based on understanding and friendship), which helps make the film such a spectacular success. Frances McDormand appears early in the film as Arquette's sister who has to leave her behind because she is forced to leave Burma with a tour group while Arquette is stranded while she waits for travel papers from the incompetent US Embassy. McDormand is, as usual, wonderful, but then she is one of our most admired actresses, who never disappoints. Arquette has been widowed and is recovering from intense grief, and as a result of her amazing adventures which ensue 'beyond Rangoon' when she gets out into the countryside (officially barred to foreigners), she finds a new meaning and value to life in helping others. Several of her companions are killed along the way. There are many excellent performances from young Burmese, or actors who play Burmese, since obviously this film could not be made in Burma (it was filmed in Malaysia and Thailand) and several of the players are really of diverse ethnic backgrounds. We see many horrible massacres and rampant violence and oppression taking place continually. Unfortunately, though many films with an axe to grind have tended to show these things for tendentious purposes, in this case I fear it is all too true. It does not appear that one can exaggerate on film any of the atrocities committed either by the Nazis of Germany or the Burmese military of today. This film really should be shown in schools. It is such a powerful lesson about the real world, so inspiring and horrifying at the same time. And yet those same parents who are content to let their kids sit around all day watching meaningless blood and gore on the screen with fictitious 'action heroes', and play computer games where everybody gets rewarded for killing other people (is that sick or what?), would doubtless complain because there are many grim real life situations portrayed here. Such is the 'hypocrisy of suburbia' into which real life rarely enters. We should all be giving copies of this film to all of our friends. And if the politicians were not all such thickos, they might even do something about the West's foreign policy.

    It was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar had to be made and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally Hollywood spice of Titanic-type love between the lead heroine and the Burmese male lead who happens to be an old man. Thankfully, nothing of that sort was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful. Anyway, the film was honest-to-God and I was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed. Apart from the fact that filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia & Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese locales, I could not find much fault in the film. You cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. It is after all, real events of a civil war. The music by Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it. I was only a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie was made on my real-life experience which I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and needless to say, I could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening wonder for me.

    A powerful movie that has recovered much of its meaning in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, together with a bit of rage because I feel that no one, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, is doing anything effective to end this shame. I think these feelings became directly from the movie, and that they were intended when it was made, so it is a successful movie. The desire for peace, the quest for enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation. In fact it is the Buddhist Burmese culture who has left the doors wide opens to their dictators. But, how can you feel angry about these poor people?

    I always wanted to see this film and when I finally got to I knew I was in for a nice surprise when John Boorman's name appeared on the screen. Known mostly for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and wrote Apocalypse Now) put together in the classic Hollywood structure, this one fits nicely with his catalog. I also can't express how perfect the timing was considering that Myanmar (Burma) is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the military "junta" run government which is the very same one (there has been a change of leadership since but it's essentially the same) depicted in the movie from 1988. Now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television (caught it on IFC) because of recent events.

    I am afraid I will have to add my name to the long list of people who remain flabbergasted that this film has STILL not ( sept 2007 ) been issued on DVD. It's one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle, especially when you consider the amount of DVD's available today containing material that should have been binned years ago. Still I have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film. As to the film itself, this is an excellent all-rounder with good picture quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic surroundings ( for a European ). How true the film fits in with the reality in Burma I have no idea, indeed, that is less important, the essential thing is that entertainment-wise, it is a success. One soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-the-river scene. It's a shame we hear so little about countries such as Burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country. Has the situation changed since 1995 ? The events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding "No" and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the lives of monks, let alone women or children !

    Lush cinematography, beautifully written and edited, John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. It interweaves a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me, popping up in my mind's eye with frequency. The story line is gripping, and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically, and in the story line. I've watched this film at least six times, and it really holds up to scrutiny. It is particularly relevant today, given world events. Check it out, you won't regret it! BTW, NetFlix does not yet carry it, but you can request that they do.

    This film should be seen by as many people as possible as it concentrates on the human rights problems in Burma. When I first watched this film in the mid 1990's it totally changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democracy movement. It effected me so I wanted to understand more about the situation. Any film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly. Patricia Arquette is superb as the American lady who due to personal tragedy has become reckless with her own life decisions and gets caught up in the ensuing conflict. It is a powerful film about a subject matter which deserves more publicity. As the film itself says the 1988 massacre of Pro democracy activists was not televised and therefore largely went unnoticed to the world. I implore everyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the Burmese people. It is about time this film was released on DVD. Can anything be done?

It's one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle, especially when you consider the amount of DVD's available today containing material that should have been binned years ago. Still I have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film. As to the film itself, this is an excellent all-rounder with good picture quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic surroundings ( for a European ). How true the film fits in with the reality in Burma I have no idea, indeed, that is less important, the essential thing is that entertainment-wise, it is a success. One soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-the-river scene. It's a shame we hear so little about countries such as Burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country. Has the situation changed since 1995 ? The events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding "No" and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the lives of monks, let alone women or children !

    Lush cinematography, beautifully written and edited, John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. It interweaves a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me, popping up in my mind's eye with frequency. The story line is gripping, and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically, and in the story line. I've watched this film at least six times, and it really holds up to scrutiny. It is particularly relevant today, given world events. Check it out, you won't regret it! BTW, NetFlix does not yet carry it, but you can request that they do.

    This film should be seen by as many people as possible as it concentrates on the human rights problems in Burma. When I first watched this film in the mid 1990's it totally changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democracy movement. It effected me so I wanted to understand more about the situation. Any film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly. Patricia Arquette is superb as the American lady who due to personal tragedy has become reckless with her own life decisions and gets caught up in the ensuing conflict. It is a powerful film about a subject matter which deserves more publicity. As the film itself says the 1988 massacre of Pro democracy activists was not televised and therefore largely went unnoticed to the world. I implore everyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the Burmese people. It is about time this film was released on DVD. Can anything be done?

    First review that I have given a perfect score to. This is an outstanding movie, well acted, directed, great story, great cinematography. A young women -Laura, excellently portrayed by Patricia Arquette, is encouraged by her sister to take a vacation in Rangoon to get over the devastating loss of her Husband and child. Its not long before she gets herself entwined in the true life battle between the Military dictatorship and the forces of democracy lead by Aung San Su Kyi. Kyi is leading a opposition to the Military rule in Burma (Now Myamar) and Laura goes and watches one of Kyi's speeches. Still not sure about what is going on, Laura is encouraged to take a visit to a village with a local guide. The guide turns out to be a key person in the resistance movement and is wanted by the Government. This movie is a must see movie.

    In the 90's, the American doctor Laura Bowman (Patricia Arquette) travels to Burma (presently Myanmar) with her sister and also doctor Andy Bowman (Frances McDormand) to recover from the loss of her beloved husband and son that were murdered in a theft at home. Laura sees a political pro-democracy manifestation to support the leader Aung San Suu Kyi and she decides to participate; however she loses her passport and she is not allowed to leave Rangoon. While waiting to have another flight, Laura meets the unofficial tourist guide U Aung Ko, who is also a leader of an underground movement, and she decides to visit the countryside of Burma. However, the military dictatorship represses the movement and Laura, U Aung Ko and several civilians try to escape to Thailand in a dangerous journey. "Beyond Rangoon" is an underrated film that has not aged, with top-notch performance of the gorgeous Patricia Arquette, I saw this film twice on VHS in the 90's and it is amazing that the military dictatorship still does exist in this country. In accordance with the statement of John Boorman in the Extras of the DVD, the dramatic scene when the commander orders to shoot the politician Aung San Suu Kyi did really happen. Aung San Suu Kyi won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and shamefully was only released from house arrest on 13 November 2010. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Muito Al&eacute;m de Rangum" ("Far Beyond Rangoon")

    This is a well made movie and is exciting. An American tourist gets caught up in a Burmese democracy uprising. Although filmed in Malaysia it has a good on location feel. Compared to "Cry Freedom" and "Killing Fields" it suffers a bit in credibility because it is a fictional story set in real life events as opposed to a totally true story. But because it is fiction it has a more of an intimate adventure feeling and you see things from her point of view. Patricia Arquette is good. She doesn't overact. The local cast is earnest and watchable. In the light of recent uprisings in the Middle East it is quite relevant today.

    This amazing film is probably the greatest triumph of John Boorman's long directing career. All the fire of his blazing courage and outrage are blended in this incredible portrayal of the dilemma of modern Burma. There is probably no military dictatorship anywhere in the world more brutal than that of Burma, which surpasses even the unlamented tyranny of Saddam Hussein for cruelty and sheer evil. It was like that when this film was made, and it is still like that now, 16 years later. Nothing has changed except that Aung San Suu Kyi is 16 years older. She is played delicately and to perfection in this film, in a brief and moving scene where she gracefully walks up to soldiers pointing rifles at her, brushes them aside, and passes on. In a sense, she is not just the Conscience of Burma but the current Conscience of the World. For she remains faithful to a cause which the world has heartlessly abandoned. Because there is no oil in Burma, it will not be invaded by the United States, Tony Blair will not go there with his pious platitudes and grin of a madman, BP will not ruin the coastline, and the arms industry must be content merely with selling guns for the population and 'rebels' to be murdered, not for invading troops to be opposed (what a pity there is less need for tanks and fighter planes, not to mention drones). Why is it that the Burmese population are so thoughtless that they allow themselves to be shot with simple rifle bullets, so that cannon shells are not required? The Burmese military really are bad customers, they kill on the cheap. But of course, like the Nazis, they get plenty of raping and torture in first, as what fun is it being a vicious brute if you cannot lord it over the people you are about to massacre before you do so? Even a Burmese soldier has his vanity. The most amazing performance in this film is by a Burmese man whose own name is the same as that of the character he plays, U Aung Ko. This is the only film in which he ever appeared, according to IMDb, so he was not an actor but 'a real person'. (Note: do real persons exist on screen outside of documentaries? This is an existential question for cin&eacute;astes.) In trying to find out more about this man, I googled the name and discovered that there is another U Aung Ko, actually U Aung Ko Win, also known as Saya Kyaung, who is closely connected with the present sinister regime, probably a relative but certainly not the same man as our hero in the film. Then I discovered that our hero lives in exile in Paris, having left Burma to live in France in 1975 (where he had previously studied at the Sorbonne), where he is married to a French woman, has assisted in the preparation of a documentary film about his country's plight, and works as a translator and language teacher. So that's who he is. The other lead in the film is Patricia Arquette, who gives a magnificently stalwart and powerful performance and clearly endured a great deal of physical hardship in doing so. The two of them work very well together and generate significant chemistry (not of the romantic kind but of the rarer kind based on understanding and friendship), which helps make the film such a spectacular success. Frances McDormand appears early in the film as Arquette's sister who has to leave her behind because she is forced to leave Burma with a tour group while Arquette is stranded while she waits for travel papers from the incompetent US Embassy. McDormand is, as usual, wonderful, but then she is one of our most admired actresses, who never disappoints. Arquette has been widowed and is recovering from intense grief, and as a result of her amazing adventures which ensue 'beyond Rangoon' when she gets out into the countryside (officially barred to foreigners), she finds a new meaning and value to life in helping others. Several of her companions are killed along the way. There are many excellent performances from young Burmese, or actors who play Burmese, since obviously this film could not be made in Burma (it was filmed in Malaysia and Thailand) and several of the players are really of diverse ethnic backgrounds. We see many horrible massacres and rampant violence and oppression taking place continually. Unfortunately, though many films with an axe to grind have tended to show these things for tendentious purposes, in this case I fear it is all too true. It does not appear that one can exaggerate on film any of the atrocities committed either by the Nazis of Germany or the Burmese military of today. This film really should be shown in schools. It is such a powerful lesson about the real world, so inspiring and horrifying at the same time. And yet those same parents who are content to let their kids sit around all day watching meaningless blood and gore on the screen with fictitious 'action heroes', and play computer games where everybody gets rewarded for killing other people (is that sick or what?), would doubtless complain because there are many grim real life situations portrayed here. Such is the 'hypocrisy of suburbia' into which real life rarely enters. We should all be giving copies of this film to all of our friends. And if the politicians were not all such thickos, they might even do something about the West's foreign policy.

    It was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar had to be made and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally Hollywood spice of Titanic-type love between the lead heroine and the Burmese male lead who happens to be an old man. Thankfully, nothing of that sort was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful. Anyway, the film was honest-to-God and I was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed. Apart from the fact that filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia & Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese locales, I could not find much fault in the film. You cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. It is after all, real events of a civil war. The music by Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it. I was only a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie was made on my real-life experience which I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and needless to say, I could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening wonder for me.

    A powerful movie that has recovered much of its meaning in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, together with a bit of rage because I feel that no one, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, is doing anything effective to end this shame. I think these feelings became directly from the movie, and that they were intended when it was made, so it is a successful movie. The desire for peace, the quest for enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation. In fact it is the Buddhist Burmese culture who has left the doors wide opens to their dictators. But, how can you feel angry about these poor people?

    I always wanted to see this film and when I finally got to I knew I was in for a nice surprise when John Boorman's name appeared on the screen. Known mostly for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and wrote Apocalypse Now) put together in the classic Hollywood structure, this one fits nicely with his catalog. I also can't express how perfect the timing was considering that Myanmar (Burma) is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the military "junta" run government which is the very same one (there has been a change of leadership since but it's essentially the same) depicted in the movie from 1988. Now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television (caught it on IFC) because of recent events.

    I always wanted to see this film and when I finally got to I knew I was in for a nice surprise when John Boorman's name appeared on the screen. Known mostly for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and wrote Apocalypse Now) put together in the classic Hollywood structure, this one fits nicely with his catalog. I also can't express how perfect the timing was considering that Myanmar (Burma) is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the military "junta" run government which is the very same one (there has been a change of leadership since but it's essentially the same) depicted in the movie from 1988. Now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television (caught it on IFC) because of recent events.

    I am afraid I will have to add my name to the long list of people who remain flabbergasted that this film has STILL not ( sept 2007 ) been issued on DVD. It's one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle, especially when you consider the amount of DVD's available today containing material that should have been binned years ago. Still I have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film. As to the film itself, this is an excellent all-rounder with good picture quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic surroundings ( for a European ). How true the film fits in with the reality in Burma I have no idea, indeed, that is less important, the essential thing is that entertainment-wise, it is a success. One soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-the-river scene. It's a shame we hear so little about countries such as Burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country. Has the situation changed since 1995 ? The events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding "No" and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the lives of monks, let alone women or children !

    Lush cinematography, beautifully written and edited, John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. It interweaves a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me, popping up in my mind's eye with frequency. The story line is gripping, and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically, and in the story line. I've watched this film at least six times, and it really holds up to scrutiny. It is particularly relevant today, given world events. Check it out, you won't regret it! BTW, NetFlix does not yet carry it, but you can request that they do.

    This film should be seen by as many people as possible as it concentrates on the human rights problems in Burma. When I first watched this film in the mid 1990's it totally changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democracy movement. It effected me so I wanted to understand more about the situation. Any film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly. Patricia Arquette is superb as the American lady who due to personal tragedy has become reckless with her own life decisions and gets caught up in the ensuing conflict. It is a powerful film about a subject matter which deserves more publicity. As the film itself says the 1988 massacre of Pro democracy activists was not televised and therefore largely went unnoticed to the world. I implore everyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the Burmese people. It is about time this film was released on DVD. Can anything be done?

    First review that I have given a perfect score to. This is an outstanding movie, well acted, directed, great story, great cinematography. A young women -Laura, excellently portrayed by Patricia Arquette, is encouraged by her sister to take a vacation in Rangoon to get over the devastating loss of her Husband and child. Its not long before she gets herself entwined in the true life battle between the Military dictatorship and the forces of democracy lead by Aung San Su Kyi. Kyi is leading a opposition to the Military rule in Burma (Now Myamar) and Laura goes and watches one of Kyi's speeches. Still not sure about what is going on, Laura is encouraged to take a visit to a village with a local guide. The guide turns out to be a key person in the resistance movement and is wanted by the Government. This movie is a must see movie.

    An Underrated Film that Has not Aged with Top-Notch Performance of the Gorgeous Patricia Arquette

    In the 90's, the American doctor Laura Bowman (Patricia Arquette) travels to Burma (presently Myanmar) with her sister and also doctor Andy Bowman (Frances McDormand) to recover from the loss of her beloved husband and son that were murdered in a theft at home. Laura sees a political pro-democracy manifestation to support the leader Aung San Suu Kyi and she decides to participate; however she loses her passport and she is not allowed to leave Rangoon. While waiting to have another flight, Laura meets the unofficial tourist guide U Aung Ko, who is also a leader of an underground movement, and she decides to visit the countryside of Burma. However, the military dictatorship represses the movement and Laura, U Aung Ko and several civilians try to escape to Thailand in a dangerous journey. "Beyond Rangoon" is an underrated film that has not aged, with top-notch performance of the gorgeous Patricia Arquette, I saw this film twice on VHS in the 90's and it is amazing that the military dictatorship still does exist in this country. In accordance with the statement of John Boorman in the Extras of the DVD, the dramatic scene when the commander orders to shoot the politician Aung San Suu Kyi did really happen. Aung San Suu Kyi won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and shamefully was only released from house arrest on 13 November 2010. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Muito Al&eacute;m de Rangum" ("Far Beyond Rangoon")

    This is a well made movie and is exciting. An American tourist gets caught up in a Burmese democracy uprising. Although filmed in Malaysia it has a good on location feel. Compared to "Cry Freedom" and "Killing Fields" it suffers a bit in credibility because it is a fictional story set in real life events as opposed to a totally true story. But because it is fiction it has a more of an intimate adventure feeling and you see things from her point of view. Patricia Arquette is good. She doesn't overact. The local cast is earnest and watchable. In the light of recent uprisings in the Middle East it is quite relevant today.

    This amazing film is probably the greatest triumph of John Boorman's long directing career. All the fire of his blazing courage and outrage are blended in this incredible portrayal of the dilemma of modern Burma. There is probably no military dictatorship anywhere in the world more brutal than that of Burma, which surpasses even the unlamented tyranny of Saddam Hussein for cruelty and sheer evil. It was like that when this film was made, and it is still like that now, 16 years later. Nothing has changed except that Aung San Suu Kyi is 16 years older. She is played delicately and to perfection in this film, in a brief and moving scene where she gracefully walks up to soldiers pointing rifles at her, brushes them aside, and passes on. In a sense, she is not just the Conscience of Burma but the current Conscience of the World. For she remains faithful to a cause which the world has heartlessly abandoned. Because there is no oil in Burma, it will not be invaded by the United States, Tony Blair will not go there with his pious platitudes and grin of a madman, BP will not ruin the coastline, and the arms industry must be content merely with selling guns for the population and 'rebels' to be murdered, not for invading troops to be opposed (what a pity there is less need for tanks and fighter planes, not to mention drones). Why is it that the Burmese population are so thoughtless that they allow themselves to be shot with simple rifle bullets, so that cannon shells are not required? The Burmese military really are bad customers, they kill on the cheap. But of course, like the Nazis, they get plenty of raping and torture in first, as what fun is it being a vicious brute if you cannot lord it over the people you are about to massacre before you do so? Even a Burmese soldier has his vanity. The most amazing performance in this film is by a Burmese man whose own name is the same as that of the character he plays, U Aung Ko. This is the only film in which he ever appeared, according to IMDb, so he was not an actor but 'a real person'. (Note: do real persons exist on screen outside of documentaries? This is an existential question for cin&eacute;astes.) In trying to find out more about this man, I googled the name and discovered that there is another U Aung Ko, actually U Aung Ko Win, also known as Saya Kyaung, who is closely connected with the present sinister regime, probably a relative but certainly not the same man as our hero in the film. Then I discovered that our hero lives in exile in Paris, having left Burma to live in France in 1975 (where he had previously studied at the Sorbonne), where he is married to a French woman, has assisted in the preparation of a documentary film about his country's plight, and works as a translator and language teacher. So that's who he is. The other lead in the film is Patricia Arquette, who gives a magnificently stalwart and powerful performance and clearly endured a great deal of physical hardship in doing so. The two of them work very well together and generate significant chemistry (not of the romantic kind but of the rarer kind based on understanding and friendship), which helps make the film such a spectacular success. Frances McDormand appears early in the film as Arquette's sister who has to leave her behind because she is forced to leave Burma with a tour group while Arquette is stranded while she waits for travel papers from the incompetent US Embassy. McDormand is, as usual, wonderful, but then she is one of our most admired actresses, who never disappoints. Arquette has been widowed and is recovering from intense grief, and as a result of her amazing adventures which ensue 'beyond Rangoon' when she gets out into the countryside (officially barred to foreigners), she finds a new meaning and value to life in helping others. Several of her companions are killed along the way. There are many excellent performances from young Burmese, or actors who play Burmese, since obviously this film could not be made in Burma (it was filmed in Malaysia and Thailand) and several of the players are really of diverse ethnic backgrounds. We see many horrible massacres and rampant violence and oppression taking place continually. Unfortunately, though many films with an axe to grind have tended to show these things for tendentious purposes, in this case I fear it is all too true. It does not appear that one can exaggerate on film any of the atrocities committed either by the Nazis of Germany or the Burmese military of today. This film really should be shown in schools. It is such a powerful lesson about the real world, so inspiring and horrifying at the same time. And yet those same parents who are content to let their kids sit around all day watching meaningless blood and gore on the screen with fictitious 'action heroes', and play computer games where everybody gets rewarded for killing other people (is that sick or what?), would doubtless complain because there are many grim real life situations portrayed here. Such is the 'hypocrisy of suburbia' into which real life rarely enters. We should all be giving copies of this film to all of our friends. And if the politicians were not all such thickos, they might even do something about the West's foreign policy.

    It was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar had to be made and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally Hollywood spice of Titanic-type love between the lead heroine and the Burmese male lead who happens to be an old man. Thankfully, nothing of that sort was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful. Anyway, the film was honest-to-God and I was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed. Apart from the fact that filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia & Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese locales, I could not find much fault in the film. You cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. It is after all, real events of a civil war. The music by Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it. I was only a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie was made on my real-life experience which I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and needless to say, I could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening wonder for me.

    A powerful movie that has recovered much of its meaning in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, together with a bit of rage because I feel that no one, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, is doing anything effective to end this shame. I think these feelings became directly from the movie, and that they were intended when it was made, so it is a successful movie. The desire for peace, the quest for enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation. In fact it is the Buddhist Burmese culture who has left the doors wide opens to their dictators. But, how can you feel angry about these poor people?
