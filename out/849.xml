    Starring Tom Cruise, directed by Tony Scott and brought to us by Bruckheimer and Simpson, that's a roll call of reasons why many would hate this before even watching it! Days of Thunder is pretty indicative of the films being made by this lot around this time. Sure there's a honest intention somewhere within to build potent character dynamics, to raise moral awareness and etc, but they always came down to relying on speedy thrills, simmering sexual tensions and a punch the air finale. These latter things are evident in Days of Thunder, making it very much enjoyable if judging on those terms. The actual dynamic of the stock car racing set-up as portrayed here is a bit suspect, but the thrills come in leaps and bounds as the cars career around the tracks and slam into each other while the respective drivers' egos explode in a flaming ball of testosterone. There's Cruise with his arrogant grin, there's Michael Rooker scowling and there's Carey Elwes doing his worst Val Kilmer Iceman impression. While out in the pits Robert Duvall adds the bit of class by juggling a dual role of surrogate father and expert stock-car manager, and Kidman as ace doctor Claire Lewicki shuffles around wondering just what is the point of all this emotionally damaged machismo. The makers don't cut any corners in their willingness to raise your pulse, and they succeed in that comfort food sort of way. But that's if you are so inclined of course? 6.5/10

    Days of Thunder has by far got to be one of the best race movie ever. Lots of good race action and a great cast that work so well together. I never miss a chance to watch it when aired. Tom did a great job as Cole Trickle and Robert as his crew chief. The story line was good and as a Nascar fan I can relate to it with no problem. I also liked the way they made of real race footage in the movie it really added to the story line. The comedy was also very good just the right amount to keep you wanting for more. I would have to say this was one of Tom Cruise best movies and one that will always be a favorite among his fans. So In closing I would have to say if you have not seen it go out and rent it you wont be sorry.

    Stock car racing is not really that much of an interest to me and as such I was not really all that interested in this film. I decided to watch it though because it is one of those movies that a lot of people have seen. As such we become one of the masses by watching this movie. My opinion was that it is all right. I am in two minds about Tom Cruise's entrance to the movie. We spend about five minutes hearing about a great new driver and Cruise enters all arrogant, macho like acting as if he knows everything. On the track he seems good but when he is put in the actual race he seems to be quite panicky about the style of racer. If he was that good then I doubt he would be freaking out on the track. But I guess that is a part of the character of Cole Trickler (stupid name I think). He is a natural driver, but driving on an empty track and driving on a track full of other drivers are two different things. Days of Thunder is about macho contests (I have chosen not to be crude here). Basically it is about a group of men trying to prove who is the manliest of the lot of them. In this contest people get hurt, and even killed, but that doesn't stop them. In fact, as quoted in the movie, they refuse to go to a hospital or even a funeral so that the inevitable is as far from their mind as possible. Plot wise I predicted it quite accurately. He becomes a racer and is good but has a nasty crash. He goes to hospital, meets the love interest (Nicole Kidman) and then goes back to racing where he wins the big race. The plot is not all that thin though because there is a relationship element in the film as well: not the shallow relationship between him and Kidman, but rather between him and another driver. At first they are rivals but after the crash, they are brought together, and though they have a smash up with a couple of rent-a-cars, they soon become friends after the steam has been vented. What used to be a movie on the lips of everybody has now simply faded away to an 11:00 time slot. They claimed that there were a lot of hot scenes between Cruise and Kidman in this movie, but there is not: only for about five minutes in the middle of the movie. What I did like was the style of photography in the film. It has a very dusky feel to it that I thought added depth to the movie. To me, it is an average movie that it okay once but that is as far as I would go.

    Days of Thunder is a film about auto racing.It was directed by Tony Scott.The cast includes Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman,Robert Duvall,Randy Quaid,Cary Elwes and Michael Rooker. The story is similar to that of Top Gun only this time,the movie involves Cole Trickle,a young stock car driver gets his chance to compete at the top level.He's a talented driver with an arrogant attitude which gets him into trouble not only with other stock car drivers and the members of his own team as well. Cole Trickle,played by Tom Cruise,is recruited by car dealership tycoon Tim Daland,played by Randy Quaid,to race for his team in NASCAR.He also convinces former crew chief Harry Hogge,played very well by Robert Duvall,to come out of retirement and lead Cole's crew. Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew while being intimidated on the track by NASCAR Winston Cup Champion Rowdy Burns,played by Michael Rooker,that results in Cole not finishing the races,mostly due to crashes or engine blowouts. After discovering that Cole does not understand the common terminology used by NASCAR teams,Harry puts him in a series of rigorous training. This pays off in future races.Aside from that,Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr.Claire Lewicki,played by the gorgeous Nicole Kidman. The story has all the elements of Top Gun.It is predictable and clich&eacute;d from beginning to end.Aside from that,this wasn't exciting as compared to Top Gun despite of having Scott and Cruise involved in it.Days Of Thunders simply felt like a formulaic movie from start to finish with nothing original in it.The same with the characters as well as they were based from Top Gun as well.In the end,if you want to see how elements of Top Gun on wheels,then this movie is it.

    If you're a guy, this movie is a ten. Racecars, engine noise, surprises, ball busting, I laughed my butt off. It's got good actors, beautiful girls, a lot of action, a lot of humor, original humor, man-woman play-fighting and sparks flying with solid intelligent arguments that go right to the issue. There are some country folk references, farming, but also lessons to be learned for farmers and old-timers about the modern world and old conceptions about medicine. It's a 10 in my book, along with Top Gun, The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club.

    "Days of Thunder" was a pretty good flick. Not Tom Cruise's best movie, but entertaining nonetheless. Maybe this makes me sound like a stereotypical guy, but I thought the racing scenes were exciting so much so to the point where when the story "shifts" (pun intended) to accommodate the entrance of a love story subplot I found it slowed the movie down a bit much, but not enough to completely take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I'd recommend checking it out, but know that you'll probably like it more if you're into cars yourself, otherwise you might not quite "connect" with it.

    This is the best racing movie ever!This is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. With a great supporting cast consisting of Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Michael Rooker, Randy Quaid and John.C.Rielly, this movie is simply amazing. Now this movie is about a hot-shot race-car driver named Cole Trickle. He is teamed with Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) a crew chief who lost a driver at Daytona a year earlier. When these two are first paired together they at first despise each other with Cole's temper and Harry's resentfulness to work with him. When these two eventually bond Cole is unstoppable. I first watched this when I was 4 and loved it. I would watch it over and over and again and pretend to be Cole Trickle. I would pretend that i was driving his car and would say the line " I'm dropping the hammer!" I love this movie. I have always loved this movie and i could still watch it over and over again. It is one of my favourite movie and anyone who loves movies should watch Days of Thunder!

    This is an excellent film about the trials of youth and the power of forgiveness. Tom Cruise's depiction of race car driver Cole Trickle is a spot-on reinterpretation of Orson Welles' character from Citizen Kane. The chemistry between Cruise and costar Michael Rooker is undeniable, and some would say that despite the fact that Cruise actually rooks Rooker, they are both winners in this film. There is also a very agreeable Rawlsian undertone to the story, channeled through Robert Duvall's character Harry Hogge. Much credit to screenwriter Robert Towne for incorporating such an important philosophical idea in a film that may otherwise have wandered into predictable summer blockbuster territory. This film comes on your chest like thunder. Go see it immediately.

    If, in the last 19 years, you haven't taken the time to watch Tony Scott's masterpiece Days of Thunder, then here is a handy reminder. Get on it! Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) is a hothead NASCAR driver with a scalding temper and a smokin' first entrance in jeans so tight that he has trouble bending at the waist. After getting into a sizzling car accident with a fellow driver, they both suffer from "brain squash". I don't wan't to write any spoilers, but if you want to read about more silliness (and there is so much more silliness) go to http://www.bigmessofthoughts.com/archives/62

    I like NASCAR, and I enjoyed Days of Thunder. The opening sequence at the Daytona 500 gives me goosebumps and makes me want to crank up the surround sound - a homage to NASCAR, the late 80s, and Americana. There were other fun sequences in the movie, like when Cole Trickle is crashing his car every week and when his crew played a prank on him after winning his first race. The movie came out during the height of the "Tom Cruise is Cool" era. And, Cruise is cool in this movie. Robert Duvall, who plays his crew chief, is even better in the film. That said, there were so many errors in this film, it's laughable. The racing shots were taken from real races, and the film editing did a poor job of disguising real race cars (like Dale Earnhardt's No. 3) for fictional ones. The timing is off. There's a scene where Tom Cruise is talking but his lips don't move. There's another scene where a character in the movie calls him Tom instead of Cole - really inexcusable that a error that big was missed. The scenes of cars ramming into one another while leading the race wouldn't be possible in reality: they would wreck or cause too much damage to remain at top speed. By conventional standards, it's a terrible movie. But, somehow, it's still a fun movie! Action on the race track is similar to the action in the sky in Top Gun. If you're up for a little escapism and wish fulfillment, then Days of Thunder lives up to the billing. But, if you're a critical viewer, you won't be impressed by this film - unless you're looking for ways to laugh at its mistakes.

Days of Thunder is pretty indicative of the films being made by this lot around this time. Sure there's a honest intention somewhere within to build potent character dynamics, to raise moral awareness and etc, but they always came down to relying on speedy thrills, simmering sexual tensions and a punch the air finale. These latter things are evident in Days of Thunder, making it very much enjoyable if judging on those terms. The actual dynamic of the stock car racing set-up as portrayed here is a bit suspect, but the thrills come in leaps and bounds as the cars career around the tracks and slam into each other while the respective drivers' egos explode in a flaming ball of testosterone. There's Cruise with his arrogant grin, there's Michael Rooker scowling and there's Carey Elwes doing his worst Val Kilmer Iceman impression. While out in the pits Robert Duvall adds the bit of class by juggling a dual role of surrogate father and expert stock-car manager, and Kidman as ace doctor Claire Lewicki shuffles around wondering just what is the point of all this emotionally damaged machismo. The makers don't cut any corners in their willingness to raise your pulse, and they succeed in that comfort food sort of way. But that's if you are so inclined of course? 6.5/10

    Days of Thunder has by far got to be one of the best race movie ever. Lots of good race action and a great cast that work so well together. I never miss a chance to watch it when aired. Tom did a great job as Cole Trickle and Robert as his crew chief. The story line was good and as a Nascar fan I can relate to it with no problem. I also liked the way they made of real race footage in the movie it really added to the story line. The comedy was also very good just the right amount to keep you wanting for more. I would have to say this was one of Tom Cruise best movies and one that will always be a favorite among his fans. So In closing I would have to say if you have not seen it go out and rent it you wont be sorry.

    Stock car racing is not really that much of an interest to me and as such I was not really all that interested in this film. I decided to watch it though because it is one of those movies that a lot of people have seen. As such we become one of the masses by watching this movie. My opinion was that it is all right. I am in two minds about Tom Cruise's entrance to the movie. We spend about five minutes hearing about a great new driver and Cruise enters all arrogant, macho like acting as if he knows everything. On the track he seems good but when he is put in the actual race he seems to be quite panicky about the style of racer. If he was that good then I doubt he would be freaking out on the track. But I guess that is a part of the character of Cole Trickler (stupid name I think). He is a natural driver, but driving on an empty track and driving on a track full of other drivers are two different things. Days of Thunder is about macho contests (I have chosen not to be crude here). Basically it is about a group of men trying to prove who is the manliest of the lot of them. In this contest people get hurt, and even killed, but that doesn't stop them. In fact, as quoted in the movie, they refuse to go to a hospital or even a funeral so that the inevitable is as far from their mind as possible. Plot wise I predicted it quite accurately. He becomes a racer and is good but has a nasty crash. He goes to hospital, meets the love interest (Nicole Kidman) and then goes back to racing where he wins the big race. The plot is not all that thin though because there is a relationship element in the film as well: not the shallow relationship between him and Kidman, but rather between him and another driver. At first they are rivals but after the crash, they are brought together, and though they have a smash up with a couple of rent-a-cars, they soon become friends after the steam has been vented. What used to be a movie on the lips of everybody has now simply faded away to an 11:00 time slot. They claimed that there were a lot of hot scenes between Cruise and Kidman in this movie, but there is not: only for about five minutes in the middle of the movie. What I did like was the style of photography in the film. It has a very dusky feel to it that I thought added depth to the movie. To me, it is an average movie that it okay once but that is as far as I would go.

    Days of Thunder is a film about auto racing.It was directed by Tony Scott.The cast includes Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman,Robert Duvall,Randy Quaid,Cary Elwes and Michael Rooker. The story is similar to that of Top Gun only this time,the movie involves Cole Trickle,a young stock car driver gets his chance to compete at the top level.He's a talented driver with an arrogant attitude which gets him into trouble not only with other stock car drivers and the members of his own team as well. Cole Trickle,played by Tom Cruise,is recruited by car dealership tycoon Tim Daland,played by Randy Quaid,to race for his team in NASCAR.He also convinces former crew chief Harry Hogge,played very well by Robert Duvall,to come out of retirement and lead Cole's crew. Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew while being intimidated on the track by NASCAR Winston Cup Champion Rowdy Burns,played by Michael Rooker,that results in Cole not finishing the races,mostly due to crashes or engine blowouts. After discovering that Cole does not understand the common terminology used by NASCAR teams,Harry puts him in a series of rigorous training. This pays off in future races.Aside from that,Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr.Claire Lewicki,played by the gorgeous Nicole Kidman. The story has all the elements of Top Gun.It is predictable and clich&eacute;d from beginning to end.Aside from that,this wasn't exciting as compared to Top Gun despite of having Scott and Cruise involved in it.Days Of Thunders simply felt like a formulaic movie from start to finish with nothing original in it.The same with the characters as well as they were based from Top Gun as well.In the end,if you want to see how elements of Top Gun on wheels,then this movie is it.

    If you're a guy, this movie is a ten. Racecars, engine noise, surprises, ball busting, I laughed my butt off. It's got good actors, beautiful girls, a lot of action, a lot of humor, original humor, man-woman play-fighting and sparks flying with solid intelligent arguments that go right to the issue. There are some country folk references, farming, but also lessons to be learned for farmers and old-timers about the modern world and old conceptions about medicine. It's a 10 in my book, along with Top Gun, The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club.

    "Days of Thunder" was a pretty good flick. Not Tom Cruise's best movie, but entertaining nonetheless. Maybe this makes me sound like a stereotypical guy, but I thought the racing scenes were exciting so much so to the point where when the story "shifts" (pun intended) to accommodate the entrance of a love story subplot I found it slowed the movie down a bit much, but not enough to completely take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I'd recommend checking it out, but know that you'll probably like it more if you're into cars yourself, otherwise you might not quite "connect" with it.

    This is the best racing movie ever!This is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. With a great supporting cast consisting of Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Michael Rooker, Randy Quaid and John.C.Rielly, this movie is simply amazing. Now this movie is about a hot-shot race-car driver named Cole Trickle. He is teamed with Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) a crew chief who lost a driver at Daytona a year earlier. When these two are first paired together they at first despise each other with Cole's temper and Harry's resentfulness to work with him. When these two eventually bond Cole is unstoppable. I first watched this when I was 4 and loved it. I would watch it over and over and again and pretend to be Cole Trickle. I would pretend that i was driving his car and would say the line " I'm dropping the hammer!" I love this movie. I have always loved this movie and i could still watch it over and over again. It is one of my favourite movie and anyone who loves movies should watch Days of Thunder!

    This is an excellent film about the trials of youth and the power of forgiveness. Tom Cruise's depiction of race car driver Cole Trickle is a spot-on reinterpretation of Orson Welles' character from Citizen Kane. The chemistry between Cruise and costar Michael Rooker is undeniable, and some would say that despite the fact that Cruise actually rooks Rooker, they are both winners in this film. There is also a very agreeable Rawlsian undertone to the story, channeled through Robert Duvall's character Harry Hogge. Much credit to screenwriter Robert Towne for incorporating such an important philosophical idea in a film that may otherwise have wandered into predictable summer blockbuster territory. This film comes on your chest like thunder. Go see it immediately.

    If, in the last 19 years, you haven't taken the time to watch Tony Scott's masterpiece Days of Thunder, then here is a handy reminder. Get on it! Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) is a hothead NASCAR driver with a scalding temper and a smokin' first entrance in jeans so tight that he has trouble bending at the waist. After getting into a sizzling car accident with a fellow driver, they both suffer from "brain squash". I don't wan't to write any spoilers, but if you want to read about more silliness (and there is so much more silliness) go to http://www.bigmessofthoughts.com/archives/62

    I like NASCAR, and I enjoyed Days of Thunder. The opening sequence at the Daytona 500 gives me goosebumps and makes me want to crank up the surround sound - a homage to NASCAR, the late 80s, and Americana. There were other fun sequences in the movie, like when Cole Trickle is crashing his car every week and when his crew played a prank on him after winning his first race. The movie came out during the height of the "Tom Cruise is Cool" era. And, Cruise is cool in this movie. Robert Duvall, who plays his crew chief, is even better in the film. That said, there were so many errors in this film, it's laughable. The racing shots were taken from real races, and the film editing did a poor job of disguising real race cars (like Dale Earnhardt's No. 3) for fictional ones. The timing is off. There's a scene where Tom Cruise is talking but his lips don't move. There's another scene where a character in the movie calls him Tom instead of Cole - really inexcusable that a error that big was missed. The scenes of cars ramming into one another while leading the race wouldn't be possible in reality: they would wreck or cause too much damage to remain at top speed. By conventional standards, it's a terrible movie. But, somehow, it's still a fun movie! Action on the race track is similar to the action in the sky in Top Gun. If you're up for a little escapism and wish fulfillment, then Days of Thunder lives up to the billing. But, if you're a critical viewer, you won't be impressed by this film - unless you're looking for ways to laugh at its mistakes.

    Stock car racing is not really that much of an interest to me and as such I was not really all that interested in this film. I decided to watch it though because it is one of those movies that a lot of people have seen. As such we become one of the masses by watching this movie. My opinion was that it is all right. I am in two minds about Tom Cruise's entrance to the movie. We spend about five minutes hearing about a great new driver and Cruise enters all arrogant, macho like acting as if he knows everything. On the track he seems good but when he is put in the actual race he seems to be quite panicky about the style of racer. If he was that good then I doubt he would be freaking out on the track. But I guess that is a part of the character of Cole Trickler (stupid name I think). He is a natural driver, but driving on an empty track and driving on a track full of other drivers are two different things. Days of Thunder is about macho contests (I have chosen not to be crude here). Basically it is about a group of men trying to prove who is the manliest of the lot of them. In this contest people get hurt, and even killed, but that doesn't stop them. In fact, as quoted in the movie, they refuse to go to a hospital or even a funeral so that the inevitable is as far from their mind as possible. Plot wise I predicted it quite accurately. He becomes a racer and is good but has a nasty crash. He goes to hospital, meets the love interest (Nicole Kidman) and then goes back to racing where he wins the big race. The plot is not all that thin though because there is a relationship element in the film as well: not the shallow relationship between him and Kidman, but rather between him and another driver. At first they are rivals but after the crash, they are brought together, and though they have a smash up with a couple of rent-a-cars, they soon become friends after the steam has been vented. What used to be a movie on the lips of everybody has now simply faded away to an 11:00 time slot. They claimed that there were a lot of hot scenes between Cruise and Kidman in this movie, but there is not: only for about five minutes in the middle of the movie. What I did like was the style of photography in the film. It has a very dusky feel to it that I thought added depth to the movie. To me, it is an average movie that it okay once but that is as far as I would go.

    Days of Thunder is a film about auto racing.It was directed by Tony Scott.The cast includes Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman,Robert Duvall,Randy Quaid,Cary Elwes and Michael Rooker. The story is similar to that of Top Gun only this time,the movie involves Cole Trickle,a young stock car driver gets his chance to compete at the top level.He's a talented driver with an arrogant attitude which gets him into trouble not only with other stock car drivers and the members of his own team as well. Cole Trickle,played by Tom Cruise,is recruited by car dealership tycoon Tim Daland,played by Randy Quaid,to race for his team in NASCAR.He also convinces former crew chief Harry Hogge,played very well by Robert Duvall,to come out of retirement and lead Cole's crew. Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew while being intimidated on the track by NASCAR Winston Cup Champion Rowdy Burns,played by Michael Rooker,that results in Cole not finishing the races,mostly due to crashes or engine blowouts. After discovering that Cole does not understand the common terminology used by NASCAR teams,Harry puts him in a series of rigorous training. This pays off in future races.Aside from that,Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr.Claire Lewicki,played by the gorgeous Nicole Kidman. The story has all the elements of Top Gun.It is predictable and clich&eacute;d from beginning to end.Aside from that,this wasn't exciting as compared to Top Gun despite of having Scott and Cruise involved in it.Days Of Thunders simply felt like a formulaic movie from start to finish with nothing original in it.The same with the characters as well as they were based from Top Gun as well.In the end,if you want to see how elements of Top Gun on wheels,then this movie is it.

    If you're a guy, this movie is a ten. Racecars, engine noise, surprises, ball busting, I laughed my butt off. It's got good actors, beautiful girls, a lot of action, a lot of humor, original humor, man-woman play-fighting and sparks flying with solid intelligent arguments that go right to the issue. There are some country folk references, farming, but also lessons to be learned for farmers and old-timers about the modern world and old conceptions about medicine. It's a 10 in my book, along with Top Gun, The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club.

    "Days of Thunder" was a pretty good flick. Not Tom Cruise's best movie, but entertaining nonetheless. Maybe this makes me sound like a stereotypical guy, but I thought the racing scenes were exciting so much so to the point where when the story "shifts" (pun intended) to accommodate the entrance of a love story subplot I found it slowed the movie down a bit much, but not enough to completely take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I'd recommend checking it out, but know that you'll probably like it more if you're into cars yourself, otherwise you might not quite "connect" with it.

    This is the best racing movie ever!This is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. With a great supporting cast consisting of Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Michael Rooker, Randy Quaid and John.C.Rielly, this movie is simply amazing. Now this movie is about a hot-shot race-car driver named Cole Trickle. He is teamed with Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) a crew chief who lost a driver at Daytona a year earlier. When these two are first paired together they at first despise each other with Cole's temper and Harry's resentfulness to work with him. When these two eventually bond Cole is unstoppable. I first watched this when I was 4 and loved it. I would watch it over and over and again and pretend to be Cole Trickle. I would pretend that i was driving his car and would say the line " I'm dropping the hammer!" I love this movie. I have always loved this movie and i could still watch it over and over again. It is one of my favourite movie and anyone who loves movies should watch Days of Thunder!

    This is an excellent film about the trials of youth and the power of forgiveness. Tom Cruise's depiction of race car driver Cole Trickle is a spot-on reinterpretation of Orson Welles' character from Citizen Kane. The chemistry between Cruise and costar Michael Rooker is undeniable, and some would say that despite the fact that Cruise actually rooks Rooker, they are both winners in this film. There is also a very agreeable Rawlsian undertone to the story, channeled through Robert Duvall's character Harry Hogge. Much credit to screenwriter Robert Towne for incorporating such an important philosophical idea in a film that may otherwise have wandered into predictable summer blockbuster territory. This film comes on your chest like thunder. Go see it immediately.

    If, in the last 19 years, you haven't taken the time to watch Tony Scott's masterpiece Days of Thunder, then here is a handy reminder. Get on it! Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) is a hothead NASCAR driver with a scalding temper and a smokin' first entrance in jeans so tight that he has trouble bending at the waist. After getting into a sizzling car accident with a fellow driver, they both suffer from "brain squash". I don't wan't to write any spoilers, but if you want to read about more silliness (and there is so much more silliness) go to http://www.bigmessofthoughts.com/archives/62

    I like NASCAR, and I enjoyed Days of Thunder. The opening sequence at the Daytona 500 gives me goosebumps and makes me want to crank up the surround sound - a homage to NASCAR, the late 80s, and Americana. There were other fun sequences in the movie, like when Cole Trickle is crashing his car every week and when his crew played a prank on him after winning his first race. The movie came out during the height of the "Tom Cruise is Cool" era. And, Cruise is cool in this movie. Robert Duvall, who plays his crew chief, is even better in the film. That said, there were so many errors in this film, it's laughable. The racing shots were taken from real races, and the film editing did a poor job of disguising real race cars (like Dale Earnhardt's No. 3) for fictional ones. The timing is off. There's a scene where Tom Cruise is talking but his lips don't move. There's another scene where a character in the movie calls him Tom instead of Cole - really inexcusable that a error that big was missed. The scenes of cars ramming into one another while leading the race wouldn't be possible in reality: they would wreck or cause too much damage to remain at top speed. By conventional standards, it's a terrible movie. But, somehow, it's still a fun movie! Action on the race track is similar to the action in the sky in Top Gun. If you're up for a little escapism and wish fulfillment, then Days of Thunder lives up to the billing. But, if you're a critical viewer, you won't be impressed by this film - unless you're looking for ways to laugh at its mistakes.

    Starring Tom Cruise, directed by Tony Scott and brought to us by Bruckheimer and Simpson, that's a roll call of reasons why many would hate this before even watching it! Days of Thunder is pretty indicative of the films being made by this lot around this time. Sure there's a honest intention somewhere within to build potent character dynamics, to raise moral awareness and etc, but they always came down to relying on speedy thrills, simmering sexual tensions and a punch the air finale. These latter things are evident in Days of Thunder, making it very much enjoyable if judging on those terms. The actual dynamic of the stock car racing set-up as portrayed here is a bit suspect, but the thrills come in leaps and bounds as the cars career around the tracks and slam into each other while the respective drivers' egos explode in a flaming ball of testosterone. There's Cruise with his arrogant grin, there's Michael Rooker scowling and there's Carey Elwes doing his worst Val Kilmer Iceman impression. While out in the pits Robert Duvall adds the bit of class by juggling a dual role of surrogate father and expert stock-car manager, and Kidman as ace doctor Claire Lewicki shuffles around wondering just what is the point of all this emotionally damaged machismo. The makers don't cut any corners in their willingness to raise your pulse, and they succeed in that comfort food sort of way. But that's if you are so inclined of course? 6.5/10

    Days of Thunder has by far got to be one of the best race movie ever. Lots of good race action and a great cast that work so well together. I never miss a chance to watch it when aired. Tom did a great job as Cole Trickle and Robert as his crew chief. The story line was good and as a Nascar fan I can relate to it with no problem. I also liked the way they made of real race footage in the movie it really added to the story line. The comedy was also very good just the right amount to keep you wanting for more. I would have to say this was one of Tom Cruise best movies and one that will always be a favorite among his fans. So In closing I would have to say if you have not seen it go out and rent it you wont be sorry.

    Days of Thunder is a film about auto racing.It was directed by Tony Scott.The cast includes Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman,Robert Duvall,Randy Quaid,Cary Elwes and Michael Rooker. The story is similar to that of Top Gun only this time,the movie involves Cole Trickle,a young stock car driver gets his chance to compete at the top level.He's a talented driver with an arrogant attitude which gets him into trouble not only with other stock car drivers and the members of his own team as well. Cole Trickle,played by Tom Cruise,is recruited by car dealership tycoon Tim Daland,played by Randy Quaid,to race for his team in NASCAR.He also convinces former crew chief Harry Hogge,played very well by Robert Duvall,to come out of retirement and lead Cole's crew. Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew while being intimidated on the track by NASCAR Winston Cup Champion Rowdy Burns,played by Michael Rooker,that results in Cole not finishing the races,mostly due to crashes or engine blowouts. After discovering that Cole does not understand the common terminology used by NASCAR teams,Harry puts him in a series of rigorous training. This pays off in future races.Aside from that,Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr.Claire Lewicki,played by the gorgeous Nicole Kidman. The story has all the elements of Top Gun.It is predictable and clich&eacute;d from beginning to end.Aside from that,this wasn't exciting as compared to Top Gun despite of having Scott and Cruise involved in it.Days Of Thunders simply felt like a formulaic movie from start to finish with nothing original in it.The same with the characters as well as they were based from Top Gun as well.In the end,if you want to see how elements of Top Gun on wheels,then this movie is it.

    If you're a guy, this movie is a ten. Racecars, engine noise, surprises, ball busting, I laughed my butt off. It's got good actors, beautiful girls, a lot of action, a lot of humor, original humor, man-woman play-fighting and sparks flying with solid intelligent arguments that go right to the issue. There are some country folk references, farming, but also lessons to be learned for farmers and old-timers about the modern world and old conceptions about medicine. It's a 10 in my book, along with Top Gun, The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club.

    "Days of Thunder" was a pretty good flick. Not Tom Cruise's best movie, but entertaining nonetheless. Maybe this makes me sound like a stereotypical guy, but I thought the racing scenes were exciting so much so to the point where when the story "shifts" (pun intended) to accommodate the entrance of a love story subplot I found it slowed the movie down a bit much, but not enough to completely take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I'd recommend checking it out, but know that you'll probably like it more if you're into cars yourself, otherwise you might not quite "connect" with it.

    This is the best racing movie ever!This is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. With a great supporting cast consisting of Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Michael Rooker, Randy Quaid and John.C.Rielly, this movie is simply amazing. Now this movie is about a hot-shot race-car driver named Cole Trickle. He is teamed with Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) a crew chief who lost a driver at Daytona a year earlier. When these two are first paired together they at first despise each other with Cole's temper and Harry's resentfulness to work with him. When these two eventually bond Cole is unstoppable. I first watched this when I was 4 and loved it. I would watch it over and over and again and pretend to be Cole Trickle. I would pretend that i was driving his car and would say the line " I'm dropping the hammer!" I love this movie. I have always loved this movie and i could still watch it over and over again. It is one of my favourite movie and anyone who loves movies should watch Days of Thunder!

    This is an excellent film about the trials of youth and the power of forgiveness. Tom Cruise's depiction of race car driver Cole Trickle is a spot-on reinterpretation of Orson Welles' character from Citizen Kane. The chemistry between Cruise and costar Michael Rooker is undeniable, and some would say that despite the fact that Cruise actually rooks Rooker, they are both winners in this film. There is also a very agreeable Rawlsian undertone to the story, channeled through Robert Duvall's character Harry Hogge. Much credit to screenwriter Robert Towne for incorporating such an important philosophical idea in a film that may otherwise have wandered into predictable summer blockbuster territory. This film comes on your chest like thunder. Go see it immediately.

    If, in the last 19 years, you haven't taken the time to watch Tony Scott's masterpiece Days of Thunder, then here is a handy reminder. Get on it! Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) is a hothead NASCAR driver with a scalding temper and a smokin' first entrance in jeans so tight that he has trouble bending at the waist. After getting into a sizzling car accident with a fellow driver, they both suffer from "brain squash". I don't wan't to write any spoilers, but if you want to read about more silliness (and there is so much more silliness) go to http://www.bigmessofthoughts.com/archives/62

    I like NASCAR, and I enjoyed Days of Thunder. The opening sequence at the Daytona 500 gives me goosebumps and makes me want to crank up the surround sound - a homage to NASCAR, the late 80s, and Americana. There were other fun sequences in the movie, like when Cole Trickle is crashing his car every week and when his crew played a prank on him after winning his first race. The movie came out during the height of the "Tom Cruise is Cool" era. And, Cruise is cool in this movie. Robert Duvall, who plays his crew chief, is even better in the film. That said, there were so many errors in this film, it's laughable. The racing shots were taken from real races, and the film editing did a poor job of disguising real race cars (like Dale Earnhardt's No. 3) for fictional ones. The timing is off. There's a scene where Tom Cruise is talking but his lips don't move. There's another scene where a character in the movie calls him Tom instead of Cole - really inexcusable that a error that big was missed. The scenes of cars ramming into one another while leading the race wouldn't be possible in reality: they would wreck or cause too much damage to remain at top speed. By conventional standards, it's a terrible movie. But, somehow, it's still a fun movie! Action on the race track is similar to the action in the sky in Top Gun. If you're up for a little escapism and wish fulfillment, then Days of Thunder lives up to the billing. But, if you're a critical viewer, you won't be impressed by this film - unless you're looking for ways to laugh at its mistakes.

    Starring Tom Cruise, directed by Tony Scott and brought to us by Bruckheimer and Simpson, that's a roll call of reasons why many would hate this before even watching it! Days of Thunder is pretty indicative of the films being made by this lot around this time. Sure there's a honest intention somewhere within to build potent character dynamics, to raise moral awareness and etc, but they always came down to relying on speedy thrills, simmering sexual tensions and a punch the air finale. These latter things are evident in Days of Thunder, making it very much enjoyable if judging on those terms. The actual dynamic of the stock car racing set-up as portrayed here is a bit suspect, but the thrills come in leaps and bounds as the cars career around the tracks and slam into each other while the respective drivers' egos explode in a flaming ball of testosterone. There's Cruise with his arrogant grin, there's Michael Rooker scowling and there's Carey Elwes doing his worst Val Kilmer Iceman impression. While out in the pits Robert Duvall adds the bit of class by juggling a dual role of surrogate father and expert stock-car manager, and Kidman as ace doctor Claire Lewicki shuffles around wondering just what is the point of all this emotionally damaged machismo. The makers don't cut any corners in their willingness to raise your pulse, and they succeed in that comfort food sort of way. But that's if you are so inclined of course? 6.5/10

    Days of Thunder has by far got to be one of the best race movie ever. Lots of good race action and a great cast that work so well together. I never miss a chance to watch it when aired. Tom did a great job as Cole Trickle and Robert as his crew chief. The story line was good and as a Nascar fan I can relate to it with no problem. I also liked the way they made of real race footage in the movie it really added to the story line. The comedy was also very good just the right amount to keep you wanting for more. I would have to say this was one of Tom Cruise best movies and one that will always be a favorite among his fans. So In closing I would have to say if you have not seen it go out and rent it you wont be sorry.

    Stock car racing is not really that much of an interest to me and as such I was not really all that interested in this film. I decided to watch it though because it is one of those movies that a lot of people have seen. As such we become one of the masses by watching this movie. My opinion was that it is all right. I am in two minds about Tom Cruise's entrance to the movie. We spend about five minutes hearing about a great new driver and Cruise enters all arrogant, macho like acting as if he knows everything. On the track he seems good but when he is put in the actual race he seems to be quite panicky about the style of racer. If he was that good then I doubt he would be freaking out on the track. But I guess that is a part of the character of Cole Trickler (stupid name I think). He is a natural driver, but driving on an empty track and driving on a track full of other drivers are two different things. Days of Thunder is about macho contests (I have chosen not to be crude here). Basically it is about a group of men trying to prove who is the manliest of the lot of them. In this contest people get hurt, and even killed, but that doesn't stop them. In fact, as quoted in the movie, they refuse to go to a hospital or even a funeral so that the inevitable is as far from their mind as possible. Plot wise I predicted it quite accurately. He becomes a racer and is good but has a nasty crash. He goes to hospital, meets the love interest (Nicole Kidman) and then goes back to racing where he wins the big race. The plot is not all that thin though because there is a relationship element in the film as well: not the shallow relationship between him and Kidman, but rather between him and another driver. At first they are rivals but after the crash, they are brought together, and though they have a smash up with a couple of rent-a-cars, they soon become friends after the steam has been vented. What used to be a movie on the lips of everybody has now simply faded away to an 11:00 time slot. They claimed that there were a lot of hot scenes between Cruise and Kidman in this movie, but there is not: only for about five minutes in the middle of the movie. What I did like was the style of photography in the film. It has a very dusky feel to it that I thought added depth to the movie. To me, it is an average movie that it okay once but that is as far as I would go.

    If you're a guy, this movie is a ten. Racecars, engine noise, surprises, ball busting, I laughed my butt off. It's got good actors, beautiful girls, a lot of action, a lot of humor, original humor, man-woman play-fighting and sparks flying with solid intelligent arguments that go right to the issue. There are some country folk references, farming, but also lessons to be learned for farmers and old-timers about the modern world and old conceptions about medicine. It's a 10 in my book, along with Top Gun, The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club.

    "Days of Thunder" was a pretty good flick. Not Tom Cruise's best movie, but entertaining nonetheless. Maybe this makes me sound like a stereotypical guy, but I thought the racing scenes were exciting so much so to the point where when the story "shifts" (pun intended) to accommodate the entrance of a love story subplot I found it slowed the movie down a bit much, but not enough to completely take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I'd recommend checking it out, but know that you'll probably like it more if you're into cars yourself, otherwise you might not quite "connect" with it.

    This is the best racing movie ever!This is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. With a great supporting cast consisting of Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Michael Rooker, Randy Quaid and John.C.Rielly, this movie is simply amazing. Now this movie is about a hot-shot race-car driver named Cole Trickle. He is teamed with Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) a crew chief who lost a driver at Daytona a year earlier. When these two are first paired together they at first despise each other with Cole's temper and Harry's resentfulness to work with him. When these two eventually bond Cole is unstoppable. I first watched this when I was 4 and loved it. I would watch it over and over and again and pretend to be Cole Trickle. I would pretend that i was driving his car and would say the line " I'm dropping the hammer!" I love this movie. I have always loved this movie and i could still watch it over and over again. It is one of my favourite movie and anyone who loves movies should watch Days of Thunder!

    This is an excellent film about the trials of youth and the power of forgiveness. Tom Cruise's depiction of race car driver Cole Trickle is a spot-on reinterpretation of Orson Welles' character from Citizen Kane. The chemistry between Cruise and costar Michael Rooker is undeniable, and some would say that despite the fact that Cruise actually rooks Rooker, they are both winners in this film. There is also a very agreeable Rawlsian undertone to the story, channeled through Robert Duvall's character Harry Hogge. Much credit to screenwriter Robert Towne for incorporating such an important philosophical idea in a film that may otherwise have wandered into predictable summer blockbuster territory. This film comes on your chest like thunder. Go see it immediately.

    If, in the last 19 years, you haven't taken the time to watch Tony Scott's masterpiece Days of Thunder, then here is a handy reminder. Get on it! Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) is a hothead NASCAR driver with a scalding temper and a smokin' first entrance in jeans so tight that he has trouble bending at the waist. After getting into a sizzling car accident with a fellow driver, they both suffer from "brain squash". I don't wan't to write any spoilers, but if you want to read about more silliness (and there is so much more silliness) go to http://www.bigmessofthoughts.com/archives/62

    I like NASCAR, and I enjoyed Days of Thunder. The opening sequence at the Daytona 500 gives me goosebumps and makes me want to crank up the surround sound - a homage to NASCAR, the late 80s, and Americana. There were other fun sequences in the movie, like when Cole Trickle is crashing his car every week and when his crew played a prank on him after winning his first race. The movie came out during the height of the "Tom Cruise is Cool" era. And, Cruise is cool in this movie. Robert Duvall, who plays his crew chief, is even better in the film. That said, there were so many errors in this film, it's laughable. The racing shots were taken from real races, and the film editing did a poor job of disguising real race cars (like Dale Earnhardt's No. 3) for fictional ones. The timing is off. There's a scene where Tom Cruise is talking but his lips don't move. There's another scene where a character in the movie calls him Tom instead of Cole - really inexcusable that a error that big was missed. The scenes of cars ramming into one another while leading the race wouldn't be possible in reality: they would wreck or cause too much damage to remain at top speed. By conventional standards, it's a terrible movie. But, somehow, it's still a fun movie! Action on the race track is similar to the action in the sky in Top Gun. If you're up for a little escapism and wish fulfillment, then Days of Thunder lives up to the billing. But, if you're a critical viewer, you won't be impressed by this film - unless you're looking for ways to laugh at its mistakes.
