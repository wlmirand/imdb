 <sinopse>
  An examination of the machinations behind the scenes at a real estate office.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Times are tough in a Chicago real-estate office; the salesmen (Shelley Levene, Ricky Roma, Dave Moss, and George Aaronow) are given a strong incentive by Blake to succeed in a sales contest. The prizes? First prize is a Cadillac El Dorado, second prize is a set of steak knives, third prize is the sack! There is no room for losers in this dramatically masculine world; only "closers" will get the good sales leads. There is a lot of pressure to succeed, so a robbery is committed which has unforeseen consequences for all the characters.

    David Mamet adapted his own play for this profane but compelling film about a troubled real estate office(run by Williamson, played by Kevin Spacey) that gets a visit from a corporate troubleshooter(Memorably played by Alec Baldwin) who lays down the law for the agents(played by Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) Either you succeed, or you're fired, and one of you is already doomed(No third prize, and Pacino was already safe). This sets off an escalating chain of desperation among the remaining agents, that will lead to an office break-in and theft... Well acted by all, and quite provocative and tragic look at some men(one in particular) who are in over their head in the wrong job, and are about to be destroyed. Only problem is that there is no one to root for here, and the constant profanity is too much, but overall story is so interesting that it makes up for the lack of emotional involvement.

    ...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company. This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood. I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)

    Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the "Greed is Good" 80's and early 90's. Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the "golden-ticket" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers. Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back. Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public

    Glengarry Glen Ross is one of those films that you immediately fall in love with or fall asleep after 30 minutes. It's 100 minutes of people talking and talking about business that most people don't know much about or don't care at all. Thankfully this piece was written by David Mamet, the guy who is easily the best dialog writer in current day Hollywood. His dialog is what makes it interesting to watch and the performances that drive Glengarry Glen Ross along. It's an actors film and we have great cast that works with each other so well. My personal highlights were Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. They dominate every single scene they were in. I really wanted more of Alec Baldwin, because his short scene was so good that it made the movie for me. But it's hard to complain about the acting when the other players include Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce giving their usual great work. I don't know what really to add. The film is based on a stage play and very much feels like one. It's not really a downside for me since the script and performances carry the film. But that's also the only real problem with Glengarry Glen Ross. If you can invest yourself in the world of real estate and the characters, you will find plenty to like. But if you can't, then this film film cause you pain.

    as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place. At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part. Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity. In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming "Passion" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!

    "Glengarry Glen Ross" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye. It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: "the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing "The Godfather Part II", 'this is the business they've chosen'. "Glengarry Glen Ross"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one. It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them. Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work. Things change for the office when "downtown" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like "ABC" and "ADIA" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business. What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so. Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.

    The single greatest cameo scene in cinema history only sets up the desperation of career land salesmen and their holding on for that next great sale. The art, the manliness, the accumulated hardened toughness of sales is on display for common folk to suffer through. Not only does the all star cast perform like all stars (every one of them) but their on screen persona's get deeper with each studied viewing. There really is no action to speak of in this adapted play, but tons of brilliant drama, braggadocio salesmanship, old school war stories and an arsenal of f-bombs are deployed to keep you on edge. Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers!

    This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives. In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

    Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is one of those films that you immediately fall in love with or fall asleep after 30 minutes. It's 100 minutes of people talking and talking about business that most people don't know much about or don't care at all. Thankfully this piece was written by David Mamet, the guy who is easily the best dialog writer in current day Hollywood. His dialog is what makes it interesting to watch and the performances that drive Glengarry Glen Ross along. It's an actors film and we have great cast that works with each other so well. My personal highlights were Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. They dominate every single scene they were in. I really wanted more of Alec Baldwin, because his short scene was so good that it made the movie for me. But it's hard to complain about the acting when the other players include Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce giving their usual great work. I don't know what really to add. The film is based on a stage play and very much feels like one. It's not really a downside for me since the script and performances carry the film. But that's also the only real problem with Glengarry Glen Ross. If you can invest yourself in the world of real estate and the characters, you will find plenty to like. But if you can't, then this film film cause you pain.

    as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place. At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part. Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity. In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming "Passion" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!

    "Glengarry Glen Ross" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye. It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: "the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing "The Godfather Part II", 'this is the business they've chosen'. "Glengarry Glen Ross"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one. It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them. Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work. Things change for the office when "downtown" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like "ABC" and "ADIA" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business. What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so. Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.

    The single greatest cameo scene in cinema history only sets up the desperation of career land salesmen and their holding on for that next great sale. The art, the manliness, the accumulated hardened toughness of sales is on display for common folk to suffer through. Not only does the all star cast perform like all stars (every one of them) but their on screen persona's get deeper with each studied viewing. There really is no action to speak of in this adapted play, but tons of brilliant drama, braggadocio salesmanship, old school war stories and an arsenal of f-bombs are deployed to keep you on edge. Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers!

    This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives. In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

    Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.

    David Mamet adapted his own play for this profane but compelling film about a troubled real estate office(run by Williamson, played by Kevin Spacey) that gets a visit from a corporate troubleshooter(Memorably played by Alec Baldwin) who lays down the law for the agents(played by Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) Either you succeed, or you're fired, and one of you is already doomed(No third prize, and Pacino was already safe). This sets off an escalating chain of desperation among the remaining agents, that will lead to an office break-in and theft... Well acted by all, and quite provocative and tragic look at some men(one in particular) who are in over their head in the wrong job, and are about to be destroyed. Only problem is that there is no one to root for here, and the constant profanity is too much, but overall story is so interesting that it makes up for the lack of emotional involvement.

    ...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company. This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood. I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)

    Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the "Greed is Good" 80's and early 90's. Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the "golden-ticket" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers. Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back. Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public

The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one. It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them. Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work. Things change for the office when "downtown" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like "ABC" and "ADIA" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business. What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so. Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.

    The single greatest cameo scene in cinema history only sets up the desperation of career land salesmen and their holding on for that next great sale. The art, the manliness, the accumulated hardened toughness of sales is on display for common folk to suffer through. Not only does the all star cast perform like all stars (every one of them) but their on screen persona's get deeper with each studied viewing. There really is no action to speak of in this adapted play, but tons of brilliant drama, braggadocio salesmanship, old school war stories and an arsenal of f-bombs are deployed to keep you on edge. Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers!

    This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives. In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

    Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.

    David Mamet adapted his own play for this profane but compelling film about a troubled real estate office(run by Williamson, played by Kevin Spacey) that gets a visit from a corporate troubleshooter(Memorably played by Alec Baldwin) who lays down the law for the agents(played by Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) Either you succeed, or you're fired, and one of you is already doomed(No third prize, and Pacino was already safe). This sets off an escalating chain of desperation among the remaining agents, that will lead to an office break-in and theft... Well acted by all, and quite provocative and tragic look at some men(one in particular) who are in over their head in the wrong job, and are about to be destroyed. Only problem is that there is no one to root for here, and the constant profanity is too much, but overall story is so interesting that it makes up for the lack of emotional involvement.

    ...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company. This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood. I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)

    Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the "Greed is Good" 80's and early 90's. Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the "golden-ticket" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers. Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back. Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public

    Glengarry Glen Ross is one of those films that you immediately fall in love with or fall asleep after 30 minutes. It's 100 minutes of people talking and talking about business that most people don't know much about or don't care at all. Thankfully this piece was written by David Mamet, the guy who is easily the best dialog writer in current day Hollywood. His dialog is what makes it interesting to watch and the performances that drive Glengarry Glen Ross along. It's an actors film and we have great cast that works with each other so well. My personal highlights were Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. They dominate every single scene they were in. I really wanted more of Alec Baldwin, because his short scene was so good that it made the movie for me. But it's hard to complain about the acting when the other players include Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce giving their usual great work. I don't know what really to add. The film is based on a stage play and very much feels like one. It's not really a downside for me since the script and performances carry the film. But that's also the only real problem with Glengarry Glen Ross. If you can invest yourself in the world of real estate and the characters, you will find plenty to like. But if you can't, then this film film cause you pain.

    as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place. At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part. Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity. In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming "Passion" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!

    "Glengarry Glen Ross" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye. It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: "the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing "The Godfather Part II", 'this is the business they've chosen'. "Glengarry Glen Ross"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one.

Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives. In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

    Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.

    David Mamet adapted his own play for this profane but compelling film about a troubled real estate office(run by Williamson, played by Kevin Spacey) that gets a visit from a corporate troubleshooter(Memorably played by Alec Baldwin) who lays down the law for the agents(played by Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) Either you succeed, or you're fired, and one of you is already doomed(No third prize, and Pacino was already safe). This sets off an escalating chain of desperation among the remaining agents, that will lead to an office break-in and theft... Well acted by all, and quite provocative and tragic look at some men(one in particular) who are in over their head in the wrong job, and are about to be destroyed. Only problem is that there is no one to root for here, and the constant profanity is too much, but overall story is so interesting that it makes up for the lack of emotional involvement.

    ...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company. This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood. I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)

    Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the "Greed is Good" 80's and early 90's. Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the "golden-ticket" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers. Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back. Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public

    Glengarry Glen Ross is one of those films that you immediately fall in love with or fall asleep after 30 minutes. It's 100 minutes of people talking and talking about business that most people don't know much about or don't care at all. Thankfully this piece was written by David Mamet, the guy who is easily the best dialog writer in current day Hollywood. His dialog is what makes it interesting to watch and the performances that drive Glengarry Glen Ross along. It's an actors film and we have great cast that works with each other so well. My personal highlights were Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. They dominate every single scene they were in. I really wanted more of Alec Baldwin, because his short scene was so good that it made the movie for me. But it's hard to complain about the acting when the other players include Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce giving their usual great work. I don't know what really to add. The film is based on a stage play and very much feels like one. It's not really a downside for me since the script and performances carry the film. But that's also the only real problem with Glengarry Glen Ross. If you can invest yourself in the world of real estate and the characters, you will find plenty to like. But if you can't, then this film film cause you pain.

    as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place. At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part. Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity. In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming "Passion" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!

    "Glengarry Glen Ross" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye. It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: "the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing "The Godfather Part II", 'this is the business they've chosen'. "Glengarry Glen Ross"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one. It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them. Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work. Things change for the office when "downtown" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like "ABC" and "ADIA" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business. What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so. Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.

    The single greatest cameo scene in cinema history only sets up the desperation of career land salesmen and their holding on for that next great sale. The art, the manliness, the accumulated hardened toughness of sales is on display for common folk to suffer through. Not only does the all star cast perform like all stars (every one of them) but their on screen persona's get deeper with each studied viewing. There really is no action to speak of in this adapted play, but tons of brilliant drama, braggadocio salesmanship, old school war stories and an arsenal of f-bombs are deployed to keep you on edge. Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers!

    This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are.

He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right.

Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the "golden-ticket" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers. Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back. Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public

    Glengarry Glen Ross is one of those films that you immediately fall in love with or fall asleep after 30 minutes. It's 100 minutes of people talking and talking about business that most people don't know much about or don't care at all. Thankfully this piece was written by David Mamet, the guy who is easily the best dialog writer in current day Hollywood. His dialog is what makes it interesting to watch and the performances that drive Glengarry Glen Ross along. It's an actors film and we have great cast that works with each other so well. My personal highlights were Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. They dominate every single scene they were in. I really wanted more of Alec Baldwin, because his short scene was so good that it made the movie for me. But it's hard to complain about the acting when the other players include Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce giving their usual great work. I don't know what really to add. The film is based on a stage play and very much feels like one. It's not really a downside for me since the script and performances carry the film. But that's also the only real problem with Glengarry Glen Ross. If you can invest yourself in the world of real estate and the characters, you will find plenty to like. But if you can't, then this film film cause you pain.

    as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place. At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part. Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity. In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming "Passion" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!

    "Glengarry Glen Ross" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye. It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: "the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing "The Godfather Part II", 'this is the business they've chosen'. "Glengarry Glen Ross"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one. It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them. Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work. Things change for the office when "downtown" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like "ABC" and "ADIA" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business. What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so. Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.

    The single greatest cameo scene in cinema history only sets up the desperation of career land salesmen and their holding on for that next great sale. The art, the manliness, the accumulated hardened toughness of sales is on display for common folk to suffer through. Not only does the all star cast perform like all stars (every one of them) but their on screen persona's get deeper with each studied viewing. There really is no action to speak of in this adapted play, but tons of brilliant drama, braggadocio salesmanship, old school war stories and an arsenal of f-bombs are deployed to keep you on edge. Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers!

    This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives. In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

    Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.

    David Mamet adapted his own play for this profane but compelling film about a troubled real estate office(run by Williamson, played by Kevin Spacey) that gets a visit from a corporate troubleshooter(Memorably played by Alec Baldwin) who lays down the law for the agents(played by Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) Either you succeed, or you're fired, and one of you is already doomed(No third prize, and Pacino was already safe). This sets off an escalating chain of desperation among the remaining agents, that will lead to an office break-in and theft... Well acted by all, and quite provocative and tragic look at some men(one in particular) who are in over their head in the wrong job, and are about to be destroyed. Only problem is that there is no one to root for here, and the constant profanity is too much, but overall story is so interesting that it makes up for the lack of emotional involvement.

    ...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company. This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood. I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)

    Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the "Greed is Good" 80's and early 90's. Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here.

The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing "The Godfather Part II", 'this is the business they've chosen'. "Glengarry Glen Ross"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one. It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them. Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work. Things change for the office when "downtown" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like "ABC" and "ADIA" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business. What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so. Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.

    The single greatest cameo scene in cinema history only sets up the desperation of career land salesmen and their holding on for that next great sale. The art, the manliness, the accumulated hardened toughness of sales is on display for common folk to suffer through. Not only does the all star cast perform like all stars (every one of them) but their on screen persona's get deeper with each studied viewing. There really is no action to speak of in this adapted play, but tons of brilliant drama, braggadocio salesmanship, old school war stories and an arsenal of f-bombs are deployed to keep you on edge. Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers!

    This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives. In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

    Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.

    David Mamet adapted his own play for this profane but compelling film about a troubled real estate office(run by Williamson, played by Kevin Spacey) that gets a visit from a corporate troubleshooter(Memorably played by Alec Baldwin) who lays down the law for the agents(played by Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) Either you succeed, or you're fired, and one of you is already doomed(No third prize, and Pacino was already safe). This sets off an escalating chain of desperation among the remaining agents, that will lead to an office break-in and theft... Well acted by all, and quite provocative and tragic look at some men(one in particular) who are in over their head in the wrong job, and are about to be destroyed. Only problem is that there is no one to root for here, and the constant profanity is too much, but overall story is so interesting that it makes up for the lack of emotional involvement.

    ...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company. This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood. I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)

    Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the "Greed is Good" 80's and early 90's. Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the "golden-ticket" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers. Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back. Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public

    Glengarry Glen Ross is one of those films that you immediately fall in love with or fall asleep after 30 minutes. It's 100 minutes of people talking and talking about business that most people don't know much about or don't care at all. Thankfully this piece was written by David Mamet, the guy who is easily the best dialog writer in current day Hollywood. His dialog is what makes it interesting to watch and the performances that drive Glengarry Glen Ross along. It's an actors film and we have great cast that works with each other so well. My personal highlights were Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. They dominate every single scene they were in. I really wanted more of Alec Baldwin, because his short scene was so good that it made the movie for me. But it's hard to complain about the acting when the other players include Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce giving their usual great work. I don't know what really to add. The film is based on a stage play and very much feels like one. It's not really a downside for me since the script and performances carry the film. But that's also the only real problem with Glengarry Glen Ross. If you can invest yourself in the world of real estate and the characters, you will find plenty to like. But if you can't, then this film film cause you pain.

    as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place. At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part. Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity. In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming "Passion" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!

    "Glengarry Glen Ross" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye. It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: "the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business.

The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men".

    The single greatest cameo scene in cinema history only sets up the desperation of career land salesmen and their holding on for that next great sale. The art, the manliness, the accumulated hardened toughness of sales is on display for common folk to suffer through. Not only does the all star cast perform like all stars (every one of them) but their on screen persona's get deeper with each studied viewing. There really is no action to speak of in this adapted play, but tons of brilliant drama, braggadocio salesmanship, old school war stories and an arsenal of f-bombs are deployed to keep you on edge. Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers!

    This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives. In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

    Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.

    David Mamet adapted his own play for this profane but compelling film about a troubled real estate office(run by Williamson, played by Kevin Spacey) that gets a visit from a corporate troubleshooter(Memorably played by Alec Baldwin) who lays down the law for the agents(played by Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) Either you succeed, or you're fired, and one of you is already doomed(No third prize, and Pacino was already safe). This sets off an escalating chain of desperation among the remaining agents, that will lead to an office break-in and theft... Well acted by all, and quite provocative and tragic look at some men(one in particular) who are in over their head in the wrong job, and are about to be destroyed. Only problem is that there is no one to root for here, and the constant profanity is too much, but overall story is so interesting that it makes up for the lack of emotional involvement.

    ...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company. This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood. I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)

    Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the "Greed is Good" 80's and early 90's. Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the "golden-ticket" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers. Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back. Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public

    Glengarry Glen Ross is one of those films that you immediately fall in love with or fall asleep after 30 minutes. It's 100 minutes of people talking and talking about business that most people don't know much about or don't care at all. Thankfully this piece was written by David Mamet, the guy who is easily the best dialog writer in current day Hollywood. His dialog is what makes it interesting to watch and the performances that drive Glengarry Glen Ross along. It's an actors film and we have great cast that works with each other so well. My personal highlights were Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. They dominate every single scene they were in. I really wanted more of Alec Baldwin, because his short scene was so good that it made the movie for me. But it's hard to complain about the acting when the other players include Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce giving their usual great work. I don't know what really to add. The film is based on a stage play and very much feels like one. It's not really a downside for me since the script and performances carry the film. But that's also the only real problem with Glengarry Glen Ross. If you can invest yourself in the world of real estate and the characters, you will find plenty to like. But if you can't, then this film film cause you pain.

    as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place. At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part. Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity. In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming "Passion" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!

    "Glengarry Glen Ross" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye. It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: "the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing "The Godfather Part II", 'this is the business they've chosen'. "Glengarry Glen Ross"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one. It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them. Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work. Things change for the office when "downtown" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like "ABC" and "ADIA" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business. What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so. Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.

I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)

    Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the "Greed is Good" 80's and early 90's. Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the "golden-ticket" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers. Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back. Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation . I understand that clips of the film are still shown as examples of usually how not to carry out an interview with.the general public

    Glengarry Glen Ross is one of those films that you immediately fall in love with or fall asleep after 30 minutes. It's 100 minutes of people talking and talking about business that most people don't know much about or don't care at all. Thankfully this piece was written by David Mamet, the guy who is easily the best dialog writer in current day Hollywood. His dialog is what makes it interesting to watch and the performances that drive Glengarry Glen Ross along. It's an actors film and we have great cast that works with each other so well. My personal highlights were Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. They dominate every single scene they were in. I really wanted more of Alec Baldwin, because his short scene was so good that it made the movie for me. But it's hard to complain about the acting when the other players include Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce giving their usual great work. I don't know what really to add. The film is based on a stage play and very much feels like one. It's not really a downside for me since the script and performances carry the film. But that's also the only real problem with Glengarry Glen Ross. If you can invest yourself in the world of real estate and the characters, you will find plenty to like. But if you can't, then this film film cause you pain.

    as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place. At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part. Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity. In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming "Passion" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!

    "Glengarry Glen Ross" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye. It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: "the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is "you're fired". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing "The Godfather Part II", 'this is the business they've chosen'. "Glengarry Glen Ross"' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received. To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore. "Glengarry Glen Ross" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern "12 Angry Men". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene. And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying "my daughter" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review "it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one. It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them. Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work. Things change for the office when "downtown" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like "ABC" and "ADIA" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business. What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so. Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it. I highly recommend it.

    The single greatest cameo scene in cinema history only sets up the desperation of career land salesmen and their holding on for that next great sale. The art, the manliness, the accumulated hardened toughness of sales is on display for common folk to suffer through. Not only does the all star cast perform like all stars (every one of them) but their on screen persona's get deeper with each studied viewing. There really is no action to speak of in this adapted play, but tons of brilliant drama, braggadocio salesmanship, old school war stories and an arsenal of f-bombs are deployed to keep you on edge. Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers!

    This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives. In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

    Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.
