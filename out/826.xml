    Before I begin this review, I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the Phantom comic books at the time, but at least this movie caught my very interest when I watched it. Later, after my first viewing, I felt that my jaw just dropped because I can't believe that I just watched a completely underrated superhero movie next to The Rocketeer which I thought was a fun and excellent film. But the reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it has some flaws. The story does have the spirit and tone of the comics in which I've heard and it has a style of Indiana Jones which works perfectly, but it suffers from a cookie-cutter plot about the Skulls of Touganda, the final battle between The Phantom and Drax was a disappointment and the romance scenes between Kit Walker and Diana would've been developed. But, with that said, everything else works in this movie. The acting is fabulous. Billy Zane, who would later play Cale Hockley in James Cameron's Titanic, did a great job as the title role and handled the character's traits perfectly. Treat Williams did a fine job hamming his role as the villain by being funny rather than serious, Kristy Swanson did great as the lovely Diana and Catherine Zeta Jones, the most hottest actress in cinema history, did great as the ally for Drax. The directing from Simon Wincer (who directed Free Willy) is pretty decent and the cinematography and landscapes are the epitome of magnificence. The strongest aspects goes to the amazingly intense action sequences and David Newman's adequately amazing music score and I liked how the title character gets it's own theme song like most movie franchises have. Overall, The Phantom isn't a great movie, but it's a comic book superhero movie that works brilliant in an Indiana Jones-esque style and it's worth watching. That's all I have to say. It is *that* good!

    I've been a huge fan of the Phantom from a young age and was excited to finally watch the (unfortunately) only movie this superhero had spawned. The plot is pretty simple, in keeping with the action films of that time- involving three legendary skulls which when combined generate an earth shattering force that can be used for world domination. The villain Xander Drax, an evil multi-millionaire, wants it by any means and the Phantom is the only one who can stop him. The action is non-stop from the first scene and to accommodate so much in the 90 odd minutes of screen-time, the director compromises on describing the origin of the Phantom and the icons associated with him. No mention is made of the mark that the Skull ring leaves when the Phantom punches (we're just given a hint) or the presence of the other ring- the one of protection. Even the name of the Phantom's trusty steed - Hero- is not mentioned, although the horse itself gets a meaty role (not as much as Devil, his pet wolf). Billy Zane portrays the superhero as a smooth talking, elegant crime-fighter- more like a James Bond in a purple tight-suit, with a punch here and a quip there. In that, he is less intense as the Phantom than I would have liked but it sure suits the movie's style- more camp and camaraderie than outright gritty realism. However, the character is shown true to the comic books, in that he's loyal, charming, morally upright, courageous and fights evil unselfishly. The stunts are realistic (he's clearly shown as human and beatable) and true to the Phantom's tradition (The Phantom always shoots to disarm), he does not kill anyone. Just like in the comics, romance is subtle and restricted to just a few kisses and the ladies are just as gorgeous as the Phantom is strong and handsome. And they're not just eye candy- and have good roles. The villains have enough screen-time to be shown as evil and hard to beat. Do not compare this to movies like Nolan's Batman since this was taken in a completely different era and the Phantom himself does not possess as many gadgets as the rich and sophisticated Batman. He relies on his speed, strength, intelligence, and friends to settle matters. My only disappointment is that this could have been a much better movie if the origins had been described so people can distinguish him from other similar superheroes living double lives (most notably Batman). As a film, I'll give it a 6 or 7 but since it is the only film of the Phantom, my loyalty forces me to give it a 10. If this movie piques your curiosity to check out the diverse and exciting world of the Phantom comics, it would have gotten it's due.

    OK yes a nine is high, but I'm judging it against all other hero movies of the time. Compared to modern movies like Avengers, the Batman reboots etc Id give it maybe a 6 or 7 mainly for the comparative lack of big budget action and effects only. Story wise, this film still kills them imo. Action wise and feel this movie has the globetrotting and backdrops and mystique that make it fit in nicely alongside Indie, Tomb Raider, the Mummy franchise; whilst retaining that roots-comic book feel captured so well in the 90s Batman: The Animated Series, and The Shadow... Just look for the scene where Zane, in his coat and hat, steals a skull and jumps through a window holding it in his hand, staring at it before looking up, the dynamism and cinematography is lifted right from the pages of a comic. You've got rickety collapsing bridges, heroines, sexy villain girls, planes, gunfights, pirates, gangsters, daring stunts, secret islands, magic weapons of mass destruction, Billy Zane just being his usual coolest man alive self... yes it's at times cheesy, yes its cornball but its a movie based on a hero who wears a purple skintight babygrow, how else are you gonna make it? It has to be. You gotta suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a comic book movie. You can't watch Superman and criticise it by saying the guy defied the laws of gravity! That's rubbish. This film gets some things pretty bad, a few of the effects, notably at the end, are pretty low budget, the sets are obviously sets, fight choreography is a little laughable... however in many ways this all adds to its charm, and character. The cast are superb, from Cary as the pirate leader, James Remar as the menacing yet cool goon, to Treat Williams' superbly charismatic yet evil badguy, and the tough-to-tell-who-is-more-beautiful Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. To cap it off Billy Zane is there as the lead, I don't know what else to say here... who else can pull of wearing the Phantom's suit and still look manly other than Billy Zane, the coolest man in movies? I am straight as an arrow, loooove women... and I would even have sex with Billy Zane, and the thing is... he is just so damn cool and manly that somehow - magically - it would still be totally heterosexual because the guy is just that epic and exudes pure distilled awesomeness. I could be at a bar after and tell my guy mates, "hey... just had sex with a guy, it was Billy Zane" and they'd all be like "oh... fair play, thats cool". No homophobia or judgement or loss of masculinity at all, just because its Billy Zane. In short, he wears a purple catsuit, and he is cool as hell still. ...now, people will judge this... they will say the film is lame, cheesy etc, that the Phantom is rubbish and base this all purely on the subject matter more than anything else, i.e. how he looks, why he uses guns but doesn't kill etc... things the film can't help because it's the character itself and story that dictates it... they are on dangerous ground here. Consider Superman, consider the Batman films, consider Spiderman... all these are perhaps the top three recognisable heroes of all time... all of their films suffered the same major problem which irritated fans... what I call "the girlfriend issue". "The girlfriend issue" with heroes ruined major story arcs in comics and sunk movies alike. The first Superman film was cool until Lois Lane hijacked it and there was that major boring flying scene with crappy music, and she nerfed up the second film because he threw his powers away for her resulting in all that following drama... Batman is just as bad with his string of non-girlfriends because his "mission" is all that matters, making people wonder is Robin more than just a friend? ... Spiderman...? "should i be Spidey or should I be with MJ?... why can't I have happiness" who didn't hate Tobey Maguire after that sappy dream sequence with uncle Ben??? This whole "you can't be a hero and have a loved one" nonsense is what ruins movies with boring drama filler when you just want action, and here is where the Phantom literally stands up and pees all over all other superhero movies combined, and why the Phantom is the coolest damn hero of all time; (look away if you don't want a tiny spoiler now)... The Phantom, unlike Batman, Spidey, Supes etc... any hero for that matter; and even James Bond who is kinda heroic and suave as hell with the ladies.... the Pantom, basically says to hell with all that overly-righteous self-denial hero-celibacy BS, and instead- like a don- gets both the good AND the bad girl at the end. So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so. Bottom line, Phantom is the nuts, you just gotta learn how to judge it properly and respect it's merits. Watch it, be a big kid, and let yourself enjoy it for what it's meant to be, a good old fashioned classic campy but cool adventure.

    Today there are numerous kinds of comic book characters. Many are separated into their own groups. Some characters are superheroes and while others are non-superheroes. Out of these two types, it is the non- superheroes who are the most complex and in depth characters to understand. There is a reason to why these mortal individuals do what they do and it almost seems like they have more power than the supernatural individuals. The Phantom is one of these characters. The character of The Phantom was created by the mind of Lee Falk and has the credits to proclaim itself as the first comic book hero. Playing Kit Walker or as his alter ego, The Phantom, is actor Billy Zane. Zane is a good fit for this role. His ability to evade hostile situations is quite peculiar due to the lack of technology of the time. In a sense, he was a super human even though he never had any supernatural powers. Interesting enough, this film comes off as George of the Jungle (1997), but this time, the main character has a college education instead of being raised by gorillas. Co-starring is Zane's love interest, is Kristy Swanson, as Diana Palmer, who looks good just the way she is. Along side her is Catherine Zeta- Jones who plays Sala, an air pirate who has some comical exchanges with Swanson's character over who likes The Phantom more. Playing the main villain is Treat Williams as Xander Drax. Williams' plays Drax with finesse as if he couldn't really decide whether he should be a ruthless man with no conscience or a man who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Not to say he acted bad but there were times where Drax acted more goofy than serious. There are a lot of neat parts that take place in this movie, much of which involves The Phantom. As a moviegoer, it's not often that a chase scene includes a horse. Horses were mans original car. Just listening to the hooves of the animal clop along the ground is much easier on the ears than always listening to the roar of a V8 engine. In addition to The Phantom's horse, Hero, he has a dog, named Devil. Devil, who has a very long tongue, is also a good animal actor. Both Hero, and Devil work together to help their master in the quest for justice. Even cooler is that they can communicate to each other! And that's not all, The Phantom works with other animals too and they're just as loyal. As stated before, he's just a well-educated "George of the Jungle". The music was to fun to listen to as well. David Newman provided the soundtrack and it's great how The Phantom was able to get its own theme. I say this because there have been other films in the past that have great ideas but weren't executed right partially due to the franchise not even having a musical theme. Besides what viewers see, how else would they remember a film? By something they listen too obviously! Look at Stars Wars. No one even has to say what it is just by listening to the main theme. Lastly, the action was good too. It is very much enjoyable to see Billy Zane, Swanson and Zeta-Jones swinging swords and firing pistols at various opponents. However, some of these action sequences seemed slowed a little bit too much and too often. There were times where I was waiting for a move to end but it was moving ever so slowly that I thought it would never finish. Also the finale between The Phantom and Drax was weak. I was expecting something a little more than what I saw. But these flaws are so minor that it won't really bother the audience. Although it is not the first comic book adaptation to hit the theaters, it is an adaptation of the first comic book hero and it is done fairly well. There are some parts that may seem out of place, but overall it is a decent adventure film.

    The Phantom (Billy Zane), descendant of a line of African heroes, travels to New York to thwart a criminal genius (Treat Williams). A great cast, lead by Billy Zane, with Joe Dante producing (and almost directing). Could Bruce Campbell in the lead have made this film better? Hard to say. (I love Zane, but I have to admit he mumbles quite a bit through this film.) What I find most striking about this movie is that it has received a terrible reputation on IMDb (ranking below 5 of 10 stars), but managed to pull a 3.5 of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. Wow. Has Ebert ever been more off the mark from the common viewer? I, for one, liked it and found it a visually appealing adventure film. I especially appreciate the setting of 1930s New York, a wonderful backdrop for a crime story. I must confess I never read the comic strip, so the accuracy is something I cannot attest to. But I would have gladly welcomed a sequel, rather than have Zane go on to make "Titanic".

    This is a fun and well-made escapist film that would have, in a better world, performed much better at the box office. I blame the poor BO for The Phantom on several factors: 1) The character has limited to poor visibility in the USA, as opposed to other superheroes 2) 'Batman Returns' and 'Batman Forever,' which preceded this, were of mediocre to poor quality, thus making audiences unwilling to risk their money to see this film 3) Period pieces are a risky venture for film-makers seeking a young audience...the Rocketeer and The Shadow (both good films!) had failed to sell tickets prior to this film. This film is not intended to be the 'Citizen Kane' of superheroes and who really needs a Citzen Kane of superheroes anyway? Rather, we have an attempt to do a superhero in the style of an Indiana Jones movie, and this actually works quite well. The substance of this movie is largely good old-fashioned fight scenes, daring stunts (there's a great scene with Our Hero jumping from a flying biplane onto a running horse...great stuff!), cliffhangers, and exotic locales. There are a number of deviations from the Phantom comicstrip that might irk die-hard fans, but I have come to accept that there will always be liberties taken in these things...IMO, this adaptation retains enough of the spirit of the comics for the liberties to be forgiven. The only weak point of this film is, for me, the strange androgynous perfection of Billy Zane's face...perhaps this film was simply made at the worst moment of 1990's male aesthetic, but when Zane is not wearing his Phantom mask, he looks too much like a male prostitute for my tastes. However, when he wears the Phantom mask, Zane does indeed look, sound and act like Our Hero, so overall I was able to enjoy the film quite a lot. Other performance were completely enjoyable, especially Treat Williams as the villain and a young smoking-hot Catherine Zeta Jones as a dangerous lady pilot. Best among the supporting cast was the always great Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the Phantom's father...this character never appeared in the comics but if my own father were to come back as a ghost I'd like Patrick McGoohan to play him! (This is somewhat poignant to write this, McGoohan being dead for a few years now, him obviously being a ghost himself....) I especially appreciate this film now, since superhero films are now dominated by over-top-sadism and ultraviolence, or by confusing messes of phantasmogorical cosmic spectacle where you can't tell what the heck is happening. This film is old-fashioned fun and escapism, and if that is what you seek, you will be happy with The Phantom.

    Only read a comic book once or twice on the Phantom. So I had no preconceived notions. I give this 7 out of 10, because it was enjoyable, and I think it executed it's ideas well (it's an homage to serials I believe, like Indiana Jones.) I liked the guy who played the Phantom, he had an amusing charisma of sorts. The girl who played Diana was cute, and I enjoyed her independent woman role. Sure it's simplistic, but that's the style you go after for this genre. It's about heros and damsels in distress so to speak. The female villainess was probably the best role. She was sexy and fun.

    OK, first of all I have to state that I've never read the Phantom before - this movie introduced me to that character. So, if this movie doesn't somehow "stick" to Lee Falk's Phantom comics, I apologize. However, as movies go, this movie is written and is filmed like a movie from the time period it tried to mimic - the late 1930's/1940's. It has a great storyline and fantastic characters. It's one of the few movies that my kids and I can watch over and over again - it's just that good. I'm not sure why this movie has such a so-so review rating. In any event, give it a try and enjoy. It has everything a good movie needs - a realistic and believable hero, a great story-line and overall objective. A fantastic protagonist who is always trying to thwart our here, the Phantom. Plus, a movie that covers New York and the Jungles of Northeaster India. It's just a fantastic adventure movie.

    The plane crashes into a cliff and explodes in a great ball of fire. The only problem is that the reason it crashes is because it has run out of fuel. So what caused the fire? This about sums up the movie. There has to be some credibility in even fantasy movies such as this. The Phantom is an eerie, brooding and pitiless character who has such strange and dreadful powers that he is literally a supernatural being and one who is essentially so unearthly that mere human beings would be transfixed with terror in his presence. Yet in this movie he comes across as being a bit of a numbskull - the lights are on but there is no one home.

    I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed. The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drops charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team. Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a much for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever "humor" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. (That was one area where I thought the X-Men movies failed. Nothing memorable at all in the score ... they should have used the theme from the cartoon show. LOL) The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels. We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days. Of course its campy but its fun and a lot of hours of entertainment for the price:

This film gets some things pretty bad, a few of the effects, notably at the end, are pretty low budget, the sets are obviously sets, fight choreography is a little laughable... however in many ways this all adds to its charm, and character. The cast are superb, from Cary as the pirate leader, James Remar as the menacing yet cool goon, to Treat Williams' superbly charismatic yet evil badguy, and the tough-to-tell-who-is-more-beautiful Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. To cap it off Billy Zane is there as the lead, I don't know what else to say here... who else can pull of wearing the Phantom's suit and still look manly other than Billy Zane, the coolest man in movies? I am straight as an arrow, loooove women... and I would even have sex with Billy Zane, and the thing is... he is just so damn cool and manly that somehow - magically - it would still be totally heterosexual because the guy is just that epic and exudes pure distilled awesomeness. I could be at a bar after and tell my guy mates, "hey... just had sex with a guy, it was Billy Zane" and they'd all be like "oh... fair play, thats cool". No homophobia or judgement or loss of masculinity at all, just because its Billy Zane. In short, he wears a purple catsuit, and he is cool as hell still. ...now, people will judge this... they will say the film is lame, cheesy etc, that the Phantom is rubbish and base this all purely on the subject matter more than anything else, i.e. how he looks, why he uses guns but doesn't kill etc... things the film can't help because it's the character itself and story that dictates it... they are on dangerous ground here. Consider Superman, consider the Batman films, consider Spiderman... all these are perhaps the top three recognisable heroes of all time... all of their films suffered the same major problem which irritated fans... what I call "the girlfriend issue". "The girlfriend issue" with heroes ruined major story arcs in comics and sunk movies alike. The first Superman film was cool until Lois Lane hijacked it and there was that major boring flying scene with crappy music, and she nerfed up the second film because he threw his powers away for her resulting in all that following drama... Batman is just as bad with his string of non-girlfriends because his "mission" is all that matters, making people wonder is Robin more than just a friend? ... Spiderman...? "should i be Spidey or should I be with MJ?... why can't I have happiness" who didn't hate Tobey Maguire after that sappy dream sequence with uncle Ben??? This whole "you can't be a hero and have a loved one" nonsense is what ruins movies with boring drama filler when you just want action, and here is where the Phantom literally stands up and pees all over all other superhero movies combined, and why the Phantom is the coolest damn hero of all time; (look away if you don't want a tiny spoiler now)... The Phantom, unlike Batman, Spidey, Supes etc... any hero for that matter; and even James Bond who is kinda heroic and suave as hell with the ladies.... the Pantom, basically says to hell with all that overly-righteous self-denial hero-celibacy BS, and instead- like a don- gets both the good AND the bad girl at the end. So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so. Bottom line, Phantom is the nuts, you just gotta learn how to judge it properly and respect it's merits. Watch it, be a big kid, and let yourself enjoy it for what it's meant to be, a good old fashioned classic campy but cool adventure.

    Today there are numerous kinds of comic book characters. Many are separated into their own groups. Some characters are superheroes and while others are non-superheroes. Out of these two types, it is the non- superheroes who are the most complex and in depth characters to understand. There is a reason to why these mortal individuals do what they do and it almost seems like they have more power than the supernatural individuals. The Phantom is one of these characters. The character of The Phantom was created by the mind of Lee Falk and has the credits to proclaim itself as the first comic book hero. Playing Kit Walker or as his alter ego, The Phantom, is actor Billy Zane. Zane is a good fit for this role. His ability to evade hostile situations is quite peculiar due to the lack of technology of the time. In a sense, he was a super human even though he never had any supernatural powers. Interesting enough, this film comes off as George of the Jungle (1997), but this time, the main character has a college education instead of being raised by gorillas. Co-starring is Zane's love interest, is Kristy Swanson, as Diana Palmer, who looks good just the way she is. Along side her is Catherine Zeta- Jones who plays Sala, an air pirate who has some comical exchanges with Swanson's character over who likes The Phantom more. Playing the main villain is Treat Williams as Xander Drax. Williams' plays Drax with finesse as if he couldn't really decide whether he should be a ruthless man with no conscience or a man who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Not to say he acted bad but there were times where Drax acted more goofy than serious. There are a lot of neat parts that take place in this movie, much of which involves The Phantom. As a moviegoer, it's not often that a chase scene includes a horse. Horses were mans original car. Just listening to the hooves of the animal clop along the ground is much easier on the ears than always listening to the roar of a V8 engine. In addition to The Phantom's horse, Hero, he has a dog, named Devil. Devil, who has a very long tongue, is also a good animal actor. Both Hero, and Devil work together to help their master in the quest for justice. Even cooler is that they can communicate to each other! And that's not all, The Phantom works with other animals too and they're just as loyal. As stated before, he's just a well-educated "George of the Jungle". The music was to fun to listen to as well. David Newman provided the soundtrack and it's great how The Phantom was able to get its own theme. I say this because there have been other films in the past that have great ideas but weren't executed right partially due to the franchise not even having a musical theme. Besides what viewers see, how else would they remember a film? By something they listen too obviously! Look at Stars Wars. No one even has to say what it is just by listening to the main theme. Lastly, the action was good too. It is very much enjoyable to see Billy Zane, Swanson and Zeta-Jones swinging swords and firing pistols at various opponents. However, some of these action sequences seemed slowed a little bit too much and too often. There were times where I was waiting for a move to end but it was moving ever so slowly that I thought it would never finish. Also the finale between The Phantom and Drax was weak. I was expecting something a little more than what I saw. But these flaws are so minor that it won't really bother the audience. Although it is not the first comic book adaptation to hit the theaters, it is an adaptation of the first comic book hero and it is done fairly well. There are some parts that may seem out of place, but overall it is a decent adventure film.

    The Phantom (Billy Zane), descendant of a line of African heroes, travels to New York to thwart a criminal genius (Treat Williams). A great cast, lead by Billy Zane, with Joe Dante producing (and almost directing). Could Bruce Campbell in the lead have made this film better? Hard to say. (I love Zane, but I have to admit he mumbles quite a bit through this film.) What I find most striking about this movie is that it has received a terrible reputation on IMDb (ranking below 5 of 10 stars), but managed to pull a 3.5 of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. Wow. Has Ebert ever been more off the mark from the common viewer? I, for one, liked it and found it a visually appealing adventure film. I especially appreciate the setting of 1930s New York, a wonderful backdrop for a crime story. I must confess I never read the comic strip, so the accuracy is something I cannot attest to. But I would have gladly welcomed a sequel, rather than have Zane go on to make "Titanic".

    This is a fun and well-made escapist film that would have, in a better world, performed much better at the box office. I blame the poor BO for The Phantom on several factors: 1) The character has limited to poor visibility in the USA, as opposed to other superheroes 2) 'Batman Returns' and 'Batman Forever,' which preceded this, were of mediocre to poor quality, thus making audiences unwilling to risk their money to see this film 3) Period pieces are a risky venture for film-makers seeking a young audience...the Rocketeer and The Shadow (both good films!) had failed to sell tickets prior to this film. This film is not intended to be the 'Citizen Kane' of superheroes and who really needs a Citzen Kane of superheroes anyway? Rather, we have an attempt to do a superhero in the style of an Indiana Jones movie, and this actually works quite well. The substance of this movie is largely good old-fashioned fight scenes, daring stunts (there's a great scene with Our Hero jumping from a flying biplane onto a running horse...great stuff!), cliffhangers, and exotic locales. There are a number of deviations from the Phantom comicstrip that might irk die-hard fans, but I have come to accept that there will always be liberties taken in these things...IMO, this adaptation retains enough of the spirit of the comics for the liberties to be forgiven. The only weak point of this film is, for me, the strange androgynous perfection of Billy Zane's face...perhaps this film was simply made at the worst moment of 1990's male aesthetic, but when Zane is not wearing his Phantom mask, he looks too much like a male prostitute for my tastes. However, when he wears the Phantom mask, Zane does indeed look, sound and act like Our Hero, so overall I was able to enjoy the film quite a lot. Other performance were completely enjoyable, especially Treat Williams as the villain and a young smoking-hot Catherine Zeta Jones as a dangerous lady pilot. Best among the supporting cast was the always great Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the Phantom's father...this character never appeared in the comics but if my own father were to come back as a ghost I'd like Patrick McGoohan to play him! (This is somewhat poignant to write this, McGoohan being dead for a few years now, him obviously being a ghost himself....) I especially appreciate this film now, since superhero films are now dominated by over-top-sadism and ultraviolence, or by confusing messes of phantasmogorical cosmic spectacle where you can't tell what the heck is happening. This film is old-fashioned fun and escapism, and if that is what you seek, you will be happy with The Phantom.

    Only read a comic book once or twice on the Phantom. So I had no preconceived notions. I give this 7 out of 10, because it was enjoyable, and I think it executed it's ideas well (it's an homage to serials I believe, like Indiana Jones.) I liked the guy who played the Phantom, he had an amusing charisma of sorts. The girl who played Diana was cute, and I enjoyed her independent woman role. Sure it's simplistic, but that's the style you go after for this genre. It's about heros and damsels in distress so to speak. The female villainess was probably the best role. She was sexy and fun.

    OK, first of all I have to state that I've never read the Phantom before - this movie introduced me to that character. So, if this movie doesn't somehow "stick" to Lee Falk's Phantom comics, I apologize. However, as movies go, this movie is written and is filmed like a movie from the time period it tried to mimic - the late 1930's/1940's. It has a great storyline and fantastic characters. It's one of the few movies that my kids and I can watch over and over again - it's just that good. I'm not sure why this movie has such a so-so review rating. In any event, give it a try and enjoy. It has everything a good movie needs - a realistic and believable hero, a great story-line and overall objective. A fantastic protagonist who is always trying to thwart our here, the Phantom. Plus, a movie that covers New York and the Jungles of Northeaster India. It's just a fantastic adventure movie.

    The plane crashes into a cliff and explodes in a great ball of fire. The only problem is that the reason it crashes is because it has run out of fuel. So what caused the fire? This about sums up the movie. There has to be some credibility in even fantasy movies such as this. The Phantom is an eerie, brooding and pitiless character who has such strange and dreadful powers that he is literally a supernatural being and one who is essentially so unearthly that mere human beings would be transfixed with terror in his presence. Yet in this movie he comes across as being a bit of a numbskull - the lights are on but there is no one home.

    I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed. The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drops charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team. Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a much for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever "humor" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. (That was one area where I thought the X-Men movies failed. Nothing memorable at all in the score ... they should have used the theme from the cartoon show. LOL) The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels. We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days. Of course its campy but its fun and a lot of hours of entertainment for the price:

    Before I begin this review, I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the Phantom comic books at the time, but at least this movie caught my very interest when I watched it. Later, after my first viewing, I felt that my jaw just dropped because I can't believe that I just watched a completely underrated superhero movie next to The Rocketeer which I thought was a fun and excellent film. But the reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it has some flaws. The story does have the spirit and tone of the comics in which I've heard and it has a style of Indiana Jones which works perfectly, but it suffers from a cookie-cutter plot about the Skulls of Touganda, the final battle between The Phantom and Drax was a disappointment and the romance scenes between Kit Walker and Diana would've been developed. But, with that said, everything else works in this movie. The acting is fabulous. Billy Zane, who would later play Cale Hockley in James Cameron's Titanic, did a great job as the title role and handled the character's traits perfectly. Treat Williams did a fine job hamming his role as the villain by being funny rather than serious, Kristy Swanson did great as the lovely Diana and Catherine Zeta Jones, the most hottest actress in cinema history, did great as the ally for Drax. The directing from Simon Wincer (who directed Free Willy) is pretty decent and the cinematography and landscapes are the epitome of magnificence. The strongest aspects goes to the amazingly intense action sequences and David Newman's adequately amazing music score and I liked how the title character gets it's own theme song like most movie franchises have. Overall, The Phantom isn't a great movie, but it's a comic book superhero movie that works brilliant in an Indiana Jones-esque style and it's worth watching. That's all I have to say. It is *that* good!

    I've been a huge fan of the Phantom from a young age and was excited to finally watch the (unfortunately) only movie this superhero had spawned. The plot is pretty simple, in keeping with the action films of that time- involving three legendary skulls which when combined generate an earth shattering force that can be used for world domination. The villain Xander Drax, an evil multi-millionaire, wants it by any means and the Phantom is the only one who can stop him. The action is non-stop from the first scene and to accommodate so much in the 90 odd minutes of screen-time, the director compromises on describing the origin of the Phantom and the icons associated with him. No mention is made of the mark that the Skull ring leaves when the Phantom punches (we're just given a hint) or the presence of the other ring- the one of protection. Even the name of the Phantom's trusty steed - Hero- is not mentioned, although the horse itself gets a meaty role (not as much as Devil, his pet wolf). Billy Zane portrays the superhero as a smooth talking, elegant crime-fighter- more like a James Bond in a purple tight-suit, with a punch here and a quip there. In that, he is less intense as the Phantom than I would have liked but it sure suits the movie's style- more camp and camaraderie than outright gritty realism. However, the character is shown true to the comic books, in that he's loyal, charming, morally upright, courageous and fights evil unselfishly. The stunts are realistic (he's clearly shown as human and beatable) and true to the Phantom's tradition (The Phantom always shoots to disarm), he does not kill anyone. Just like in the comics, romance is subtle and restricted to just a few kisses and the ladies are just as gorgeous as the Phantom is strong and handsome. And they're not just eye candy- and have good roles. The villains have enough screen-time to be shown as evil and hard to beat. Do not compare this to movies like Nolan's Batman since this was taken in a completely different era and the Phantom himself does not possess as many gadgets as the rich and sophisticated Batman. He relies on his speed, strength, intelligence, and friends to settle matters. My only disappointment is that this could have been a much better movie if the origins had been described so people can distinguish him from other similar superheroes living double lives (most notably Batman). As a film, I'll give it a 6 or 7 but since it is the only film of the Phantom, my loyalty forces me to give it a 10. If this movie piques your curiosity to check out the diverse and exciting world of the Phantom comics, it would have gotten it's due.

    OK yes a nine is high, but I'm judging it against all other hero movies of the time. Compared to modern movies like Avengers, the Batman reboots etc Id give it maybe a 6 or 7 mainly for the comparative lack of big budget action and effects only. Story wise, this film still kills them imo. Action wise and feel this movie has the globetrotting and backdrops and mystique that make it fit in nicely alongside Indie, Tomb Raider, the Mummy franchise; whilst retaining that roots-comic book feel captured so well in the 90s Batman: The Animated Series, and The Shadow... Just look for the scene where Zane, in his coat and hat, steals a skull and jumps through a window holding it in his hand, staring at it before looking up, the dynamism and cinematography is lifted right from the pages of a comic. You've got rickety collapsing bridges, heroines, sexy villain girls, planes, gunfights, pirates, gangsters, daring stunts, secret islands, magic weapons of mass destruction, Billy Zane just being his usual coolest man alive self... yes it's at times cheesy, yes its cornball but its a movie based on a hero who wears a purple skintight babygrow, how else are you gonna make it? It has to be. You gotta suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a comic book movie. You can't watch Superman and criticise it by saying the guy defied the laws of gravity! That's rubbish. This film gets some things pretty bad, a few of the effects, notably at the end, are pretty low budget, the sets are obviously sets, fight choreography is a little laughable... however in many ways this all adds to its charm, and character. The cast are superb, from Cary as the pirate leader, James Remar as the menacing yet cool goon, to Treat Williams' superbly charismatic yet evil badguy, and the tough-to-tell-who-is-more-beautiful Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

(I love Zane, but I have to admit he mumbles quite a bit through this film.) What I find most striking about this movie is that it has received a terrible reputation on IMDb (ranking below 5 of 10 stars), but managed to pull a 3.5 of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. Wow. Has Ebert ever been more off the mark from the common viewer? I, for one, liked it and found it a visually appealing adventure film. I especially appreciate the setting of 1930s New York, a wonderful backdrop for a crime story. I must confess I never read the comic strip, so the accuracy is something I cannot attest to. But I would have gladly welcomed a sequel, rather than have Zane go on to make "Titanic".

    This is a fun and well-made escapist film that would have, in a better world, performed much better at the box office. I blame the poor BO for The Phantom on several factors: 1) The character has limited to poor visibility in the USA, as opposed to other superheroes 2) 'Batman Returns' and 'Batman Forever,' which preceded this, were of mediocre to poor quality, thus making audiences unwilling to risk their money to see this film 3) Period pieces are a risky venture for film-makers seeking a young audience...the Rocketeer and The Shadow (both good films!) had failed to sell tickets prior to this film. This film is not intended to be the 'Citizen Kane' of superheroes and who really needs a Citzen Kane of superheroes anyway? Rather, we have an attempt to do a superhero in the style of an Indiana Jones movie, and this actually works quite well. The substance of this movie is largely good old-fashioned fight scenes, daring stunts (there's a great scene with Our Hero jumping from a flying biplane onto a running horse...great stuff!), cliffhangers, and exotic locales. There are a number of deviations from the Phantom comicstrip that might irk die-hard fans, but I have come to accept that there will always be liberties taken in these things...IMO, this adaptation retains enough of the spirit of the comics for the liberties to be forgiven. The only weak point of this film is, for me, the strange androgynous perfection of Billy Zane's face...perhaps this film was simply made at the worst moment of 1990's male aesthetic, but when Zane is not wearing his Phantom mask, he looks too much like a male prostitute for my tastes. However, when he wears the Phantom mask, Zane does indeed look, sound and act like Our Hero, so overall I was able to enjoy the film quite a lot. Other performance were completely enjoyable, especially Treat Williams as the villain and a young smoking-hot Catherine Zeta Jones as a dangerous lady pilot. Best among the supporting cast was the always great Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the Phantom's father...this character never appeared in the comics but if my own father were to come back as a ghost I'd like Patrick McGoohan to play him! (This is somewhat poignant to write this, McGoohan being dead for a few years now, him obviously being a ghost himself....) I especially appreciate this film now, since superhero films are now dominated by over-top-sadism and ultraviolence, or by confusing messes of phantasmogorical cosmic spectacle where you can't tell what the heck is happening. This film is old-fashioned fun and escapism, and if that is what you seek, you will be happy with The Phantom.

    Only read a comic book once or twice on the Phantom. So I had no preconceived notions. I give this 7 out of 10, because it was enjoyable, and I think it executed it's ideas well (it's an homage to serials I believe, like Indiana Jones.) I liked the guy who played the Phantom, he had an amusing charisma of sorts. The girl who played Diana was cute, and I enjoyed her independent woman role. Sure it's simplistic, but that's the style you go after for this genre. It's about heros and damsels in distress so to speak. The female villainess was probably the best role. She was sexy and fun.

    OK, first of all I have to state that I've never read the Phantom before - this movie introduced me to that character. So, if this movie doesn't somehow "stick" to Lee Falk's Phantom comics, I apologize. However, as movies go, this movie is written and is filmed like a movie from the time period it tried to mimic - the late 1930's/1940's. It has a great storyline and fantastic characters. It's one of the few movies that my kids and I can watch over and over again - it's just that good. I'm not sure why this movie has such a so-so review rating. In any event, give it a try and enjoy. It has everything a good movie needs - a realistic and believable hero, a great story-line and overall objective. A fantastic protagonist who is always trying to thwart our here, the Phantom. Plus, a movie that covers New York and the Jungles of Northeaster India. It's just a fantastic adventure movie.

    The plane crashes into a cliff and explodes in a great ball of fire. The only problem is that the reason it crashes is because it has run out of fuel. So what caused the fire? This about sums up the movie. There has to be some credibility in even fantasy movies such as this. The Phantom is an eerie, brooding and pitiless character who has such strange and dreadful powers that he is literally a supernatural being and one who is essentially so unearthly that mere human beings would be transfixed with terror in his presence. Yet in this movie he comes across as being a bit of a numbskull - the lights are on but there is no one home.

    I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed. The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drops charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team. Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a much for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever "humor" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. (That was one area where I thought the X-Men movies failed. Nothing memorable at all in the score ... they should have used the theme from the cartoon show. LOL) The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels. We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days. Of course its campy but its fun and a lot of hours of entertainment for the price:

    Before I begin this review, I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the Phantom comic books at the time, but at least this movie caught my very interest when I watched it. Later, after my first viewing, I felt that my jaw just dropped because I can't believe that I just watched a completely underrated superhero movie next to The Rocketeer which I thought was a fun and excellent film. But the reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it has some flaws. The story does have the spirit and tone of the comics in which I've heard and it has a style of Indiana Jones which works perfectly, but it suffers from a cookie-cutter plot about the Skulls of Touganda, the final battle between The Phantom and Drax was a disappointment and the romance scenes between Kit Walker and Diana would've been developed. But, with that said, everything else works in this movie. The acting is fabulous. Billy Zane, who would later play Cale Hockley in James Cameron's Titanic, did a great job as the title role and handled the character's traits perfectly. Treat Williams did a fine job hamming his role as the villain by being funny rather than serious, Kristy Swanson did great as the lovely Diana and Catherine Zeta Jones, the most hottest actress in cinema history, did great as the ally for Drax. The directing from Simon Wincer (who directed Free Willy) is pretty decent and the cinematography and landscapes are the epitome of magnificence. The strongest aspects goes to the amazingly intense action sequences and David Newman's adequately amazing music score and I liked how the title character gets it's own theme song like most movie franchises have. Overall, The Phantom isn't a great movie, but it's a comic book superhero movie that works brilliant in an Indiana Jones-esque style and it's worth watching. That's all I have to say. It is *that* good!

    I've been a huge fan of the Phantom from a young age and was excited to finally watch the (unfortunately) only movie this superhero had spawned. The plot is pretty simple, in keeping with the action films of that time- involving three legendary skulls which when combined generate an earth shattering force that can be used for world domination. The villain Xander Drax, an evil multi-millionaire, wants it by any means and the Phantom is the only one who can stop him. The action is non-stop from the first scene and to accommodate so much in the 90 odd minutes of screen-time, the director compromises on describing the origin of the Phantom and the icons associated with him. No mention is made of the mark that the Skull ring leaves when the Phantom punches (we're just given a hint) or the presence of the other ring- the one of protection. Even the name of the Phantom's trusty steed - Hero- is not mentioned, although the horse itself gets a meaty role (not as much as Devil, his pet wolf). Billy Zane portrays the superhero as a smooth talking, elegant crime-fighter- more like a James Bond in a purple tight-suit, with a punch here and a quip there. In that, he is less intense as the Phantom than I would have liked but it sure suits the movie's style- more camp and camaraderie than outright gritty realism. However, the character is shown true to the comic books, in that he's loyal, charming, morally upright, courageous and fights evil unselfishly. The stunts are realistic (he's clearly shown as human and beatable) and true to the Phantom's tradition (The Phantom always shoots to disarm), he does not kill anyone. Just like in the comics, romance is subtle and restricted to just a few kisses and the ladies are just as gorgeous as the Phantom is strong and handsome. And they're not just eye candy- and have good roles. The villains have enough screen-time to be shown as evil and hard to beat. Do not compare this to movies like Nolan's Batman since this was taken in a completely different era and the Phantom himself does not possess as many gadgets as the rich and sophisticated Batman. He relies on his speed, strength, intelligence, and friends to settle matters. My only disappointment is that this could have been a much better movie if the origins had been described so people can distinguish him from other similar superheroes living double lives (most notably Batman). As a film, I'll give it a 6 or 7 but since it is the only film of the Phantom, my loyalty forces me to give it a 10. If this movie piques your curiosity to check out the diverse and exciting world of the Phantom comics, it would have gotten it's due.

    OK yes a nine is high, but I'm judging it against all other hero movies of the time. Compared to modern movies like Avengers, the Batman reboots etc Id give it maybe a 6 or 7 mainly for the comparative lack of big budget action and effects only. Story wise, this film still kills them imo. Action wise and feel this movie has the globetrotting and backdrops and mystique that make it fit in nicely alongside Indie, Tomb Raider, the Mummy franchise; whilst retaining that roots-comic book feel captured so well in the 90s Batman: The Animated Series, and The Shadow... Just look for the scene where Zane, in his coat and hat, steals a skull and jumps through a window holding it in his hand, staring at it before looking up, the dynamism and cinematography is lifted right from the pages of a comic. You've got rickety collapsing bridges, heroines, sexy villain girls, planes, gunfights, pirates, gangsters, daring stunts, secret islands, magic weapons of mass destruction, Billy Zane just being his usual coolest man alive self... yes it's at times cheesy, yes its cornball but its a movie based on a hero who wears a purple skintight babygrow, how else are you gonna make it? It has to be. You gotta suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a comic book movie. You can't watch Superman and criticise it by saying the guy defied the laws of gravity! That's rubbish. This film gets some things pretty bad, a few of the effects, notably at the end, are pretty low budget, the sets are obviously sets, fight choreography is a little laughable... however in many ways this all adds to its charm, and character. The cast are superb, from Cary as the pirate leader, James Remar as the menacing yet cool goon, to Treat Williams' superbly charismatic yet evil badguy, and the tough-to-tell-who-is-more-beautiful Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. To cap it off Billy Zane is there as the lead, I don't know what else to say here... who else can pull of wearing the Phantom's suit and still look manly other than Billy Zane, the coolest man in movies? I am straight as an arrow, loooove women... and I would even have sex with Billy Zane, and the thing is... he is just so damn cool and manly that somehow - magically - it would still be totally heterosexual because the guy is just that epic and exudes pure distilled awesomeness. I could be at a bar after and tell my guy mates, "hey... just had sex with a guy, it was Billy Zane" and they'd all be like "oh... fair play, thats cool". No homophobia or judgement or loss of masculinity at all, just because its Billy Zane. In short, he wears a purple catsuit, and he is cool as hell still. ...now, people will judge this... they will say the film is lame, cheesy etc, that the Phantom is rubbish and base this all purely on the subject matter more than anything else, i.e. how he looks, why he uses guns but doesn't kill etc... things the film can't help because it's the character itself and story that dictates it... they are on dangerous ground here. Consider Superman, consider the Batman films, consider Spiderman... all these are perhaps the top three recognisable heroes of all time... all of their films suffered the same major problem which irritated fans... what I call "the girlfriend issue". "The girlfriend issue" with heroes ruined major story arcs in comics and sunk movies alike. The first Superman film was cool until Lois Lane hijacked it and there was that major boring flying scene with crappy music, and she nerfed up the second film because he threw his powers away for her resulting in all that following drama... Batman is just as bad with his string of non-girlfriends because his "mission" is all that matters, making people wonder is Robin more than just a friend? ... Spiderman...? "should i be Spidey or should I be with MJ?... why can't I have happiness" who didn't hate Tobey Maguire after that sappy dream sequence with uncle Ben??? This whole "you can't be a hero and have a loved one" nonsense is what ruins movies with boring drama filler when you just want action, and here is where the Phantom literally stands up and pees all over all other superhero movies combined, and why the Phantom is the coolest damn hero of all time; (look away if you don't want a tiny spoiler now)... The Phantom, unlike Batman, Spidey, Supes etc... any hero for that matter; and even James Bond who is kinda heroic and suave as hell with the ladies.... the Pantom, basically says to hell with all that overly-righteous self-denial hero-celibacy BS, and instead- like a don- gets both the good AND the bad girl at the end. So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so. Bottom line, Phantom is the nuts, you just gotta learn how to judge it properly and respect it's merits. Watch it, be a big kid, and let yourself enjoy it for what it's meant to be, a good old fashioned classic campy but cool adventure.

    Today there are numerous kinds of comic book characters. Many are separated into their own groups. Some characters are superheroes and while others are non-superheroes. Out of these two types, it is the non- superheroes who are the most complex and in depth characters to understand. There is a reason to why these mortal individuals do what they do and it almost seems like they have more power than the supernatural individuals. The Phantom is one of these characters. The character of The Phantom was created by the mind of Lee Falk and has the credits to proclaim itself as the first comic book hero. Playing Kit Walker or as his alter ego, The Phantom, is actor Billy Zane. Zane is a good fit for this role. His ability to evade hostile situations is quite peculiar due to the lack of technology of the time. In a sense, he was a super human even though he never had any supernatural powers. Interesting enough, this film comes off as George of the Jungle (1997), but this time, the main character has a college education instead of being raised by gorillas. Co-starring is Zane's love interest, is Kristy Swanson, as Diana Palmer, who looks good just the way she is. Along side her is Catherine Zeta- Jones who plays Sala, an air pirate who has some comical exchanges with Swanson's character over who likes The Phantom more. Playing the main villain is Treat Williams as Xander Drax. Williams' plays Drax with finesse as if he couldn't really decide whether he should be a ruthless man with no conscience or a man who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Not to say he acted bad but there were times where Drax acted more goofy than serious. There are a lot of neat parts that take place in this movie, much of which involves The Phantom. As a moviegoer, it's not often that a chase scene includes a horse. Horses were mans original car. Just listening to the hooves of the animal clop along the ground is much easier on the ears than always listening to the roar of a V8 engine. In addition to The Phantom's horse, Hero, he has a dog, named Devil. Devil, who has a very long tongue, is also a good animal actor. Both Hero, and Devil work together to help their master in the quest for justice. Even cooler is that they can communicate to each other! And that's not all, The Phantom works with other animals too and they're just as loyal. As stated before, he's just a well-educated "George of the Jungle". The music was to fun to listen to as well. David Newman provided the soundtrack and it's great how The Phantom was able to get its own theme. I say this because there have been other films in the past that have great ideas but weren't executed right partially due to the franchise not even having a musical theme. Besides what viewers see, how else would they remember a film? By something they listen too obviously! Look at Stars Wars. No one even has to say what it is just by listening to the main theme. Lastly, the action was good too. It is very much enjoyable to see Billy Zane, Swanson and Zeta-Jones swinging swords and firing pistols at various opponents. However, some of these action sequences seemed slowed a little bit too much and too often. There were times where I was waiting for a move to end but it was moving ever so slowly that I thought it would never finish. Also the finale between The Phantom and Drax was weak. I was expecting something a little more than what I saw. But these flaws are so minor that it won't really bother the audience. Although it is not the first comic book adaptation to hit the theaters, it is an adaptation of the first comic book hero and it is done fairly well. There are some parts that may seem out of place, but overall it is a decent adventure film.

    Before I begin this review, I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the Phantom comic books at the time, but at least this movie caught my very interest when I watched it. Later, after my first viewing, I felt that my jaw just dropped because I can't believe that I just watched a completely underrated superhero movie next to The Rocketeer which I thought was a fun and excellent film. But the reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it has some flaws. The story does have the spirit and tone of the comics in which I've heard and it has a style of Indiana Jones which works perfectly, but it suffers from a cookie-cutter plot about the Skulls of Touganda, the final battle between The Phantom and Drax was a disappointment and the romance scenes between Kit Walker and Diana would've been developed. But, with that said, everything else works in this movie. The acting is fabulous. Billy Zane, who would later play Cale Hockley in James Cameron's Titanic, did a great job as the title role and handled the character's traits perfectly. Treat Williams did a fine job hamming his role as the villain by being funny rather than serious, Kristy Swanson did great as the lovely Diana and Catherine Zeta Jones, the most hottest actress in cinema history, did great as the ally for Drax. The directing from Simon Wincer (who directed Free Willy) is pretty decent and the cinematography and landscapes are the epitome of magnificence. The strongest aspects goes to the amazingly intense action sequences and David Newman's adequately amazing music score and I liked how the title character gets it's own theme song like most movie franchises have. Overall, The Phantom isn't a great movie, but it's a comic book superhero movie that works brilliant in an Indiana Jones-esque style and it's worth watching. That's all I have to say. It is *that* good!

    I've been a huge fan of the Phantom from a young age and was excited to finally watch the (unfortunately) only movie this superhero had spawned. The plot is pretty simple, in keeping with the action films of that time- involving three legendary skulls which when combined generate an earth shattering force that can be used for world domination. The villain Xander Drax, an evil multi-millionaire, wants it by any means and the Phantom is the only one who can stop him. The action is non-stop from the first scene and to accommodate so much in the 90 odd minutes of screen-time, the director compromises on describing the origin of the Phantom and the icons associated with him. No mention is made of the mark that the Skull ring leaves when the Phantom punches (we're just given a hint) or the presence of the other ring- the one of protection. Even the name of the Phantom's trusty steed - Hero- is not mentioned, although the horse itself gets a meaty role (not as much as Devil, his pet wolf). Billy Zane portrays the superhero as a smooth talking, elegant crime-fighter- more like a James Bond in a purple tight-suit, with a punch here and a quip there. In that, he is less intense as the Phantom than I would have liked but it sure suits the movie's style- more camp and camaraderie than outright gritty realism. However, the character is shown true to the comic books, in that he's loyal, charming, morally upright, courageous and fights evil unselfishly. The stunts are realistic (he's clearly shown as human and beatable) and true to the Phantom's tradition (The Phantom always shoots to disarm), he does not kill anyone. Just like in the comics, romance is subtle and restricted to just a few kisses and the ladies are just as gorgeous as the Phantom is strong and handsome. And they're not just eye candy- and have good roles. The villains have enough screen-time to be shown as evil and hard to beat. Do not compare this to movies like Nolan's Batman since this was taken in a completely different era and the Phantom himself does not possess as many gadgets as the rich and sophisticated Batman. He relies on his speed, strength, intelligence, and friends to settle matters. My only disappointment is that this could have been a much better movie if the origins had been described so people can distinguish him from other similar superheroes living double lives (most notably Batman). As a film, I'll give it a 6 or 7 but since it is the only film of the Phantom, my loyalty forces me to give it a 10. If this movie piques your curiosity to check out the diverse and exciting world of the Phantom comics, it would have gotten it's due.

    OK yes a nine is high, but I'm judging it against all other hero movies of the time. Compared to modern movies like Avengers, the Batman reboots etc Id give it maybe a 6 or 7 mainly for the comparative lack of big budget action and effects only. Story wise, this film still kills them imo. Action wise and feel this movie has the globetrotting and backdrops and mystique that make it fit in nicely alongside Indie, Tomb Raider, the Mummy franchise; whilst retaining that roots-comic book feel captured so well in the 90s Batman: The Animated Series, and The Shadow... Just look for the scene where Zane, in his coat and hat, steals a skull and jumps through a window holding it in his hand, staring at it before looking up, the dynamism and cinematography is lifted right from the pages of a comic. You've got rickety collapsing bridges, heroines, sexy villain girls, planes, gunfights, pirates, gangsters, daring stunts, secret islands, magic weapons of mass destruction, Billy Zane just being his usual coolest man alive self... yes it's at times cheesy, yes its cornball but its a movie based on a hero who wears a purple skintight babygrow, how else are you gonna make it? It has to be. You gotta suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a comic book movie. You can't watch Superman and criticise it by saying the guy defied the laws of gravity! That's rubbish. This film gets some things pretty bad, a few of the effects, notably at the end, are pretty low budget, the sets are obviously sets, fight choreography is a little laughable... however in many ways this all adds to its charm, and character. The cast are superb, from Cary as the pirate leader, James Remar as the menacing yet cool goon, to Treat Williams' superbly charismatic yet evil badguy, and the tough-to-tell-who-is-more-beautiful Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. To cap it off Billy Zane is there as the lead, I don't know what else to say here... who else can pull of wearing the Phantom's suit and still look manly other than Billy Zane, the coolest man in movies? I am straight as an arrow, loooove women... and I would even have sex with Billy Zane, and the thing is... he is just so damn cool and manly that somehow - magically - it would still be totally heterosexual because the guy is just that epic and exudes pure distilled awesomeness. I could be at a bar after and tell my guy mates, "hey... just had sex with a guy, it was Billy Zane" and they'd all be like "oh... fair play, thats cool". No homophobia or judgement or loss of masculinity at all, just because its Billy Zane. In short, he wears a purple catsuit, and he is cool as hell still. ...now, people will judge this... they will say the film is lame, cheesy etc, that the Phantom is rubbish and base this all purely on the subject matter more than anything else, i.e. how he looks, why he uses guns but doesn't kill etc... things the film can't help because it's the character itself and story that dictates it... they are on dangerous ground here. Consider Superman, consider the Batman films, consider Spiderman... all these are perhaps the top three recognisable heroes of all time... all of their films suffered the same major problem which irritated fans... what I call "the girlfriend issue". "The girlfriend issue" with heroes ruined major story arcs in comics and sunk movies alike. The first Superman film was cool until Lois Lane hijacked it and there was that major boring flying scene with crappy music, and she nerfed up the second film because he threw his powers away for her resulting in all that following drama... Batman is just as bad with his string of non-girlfriends because his "mission" is all that matters, making people wonder is Robin more than just a friend? ... Spiderman...? "should i be Spidey or should I be with MJ?... why can't I have happiness" who didn't hate Tobey Maguire after that sappy dream sequence with uncle Ben??? This whole "you can't be a hero and have a loved one" nonsense is what ruins movies with boring drama filler when you just want action, and here is where the Phantom literally stands up and pees all over all other superhero movies combined, and why the Phantom is the coolest damn hero of all time; (look away if you don't want a tiny spoiler now)... The Phantom, unlike Batman, Spidey, Supes etc... any hero for that matter; and even James Bond who is kinda heroic and suave as hell with the ladies.... the Pantom, basically says to hell with all that overly-righteous self-denial hero-celibacy BS, and instead- like a don- gets both the good AND the bad girl at the end. So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so. Bottom line, Phantom is the nuts, you just gotta learn how to judge it properly and respect it's merits. Watch it, be a big kid, and let yourself enjoy it for what it's meant to be, a good old fashioned classic campy but cool adventure.

    Today there are numerous kinds of comic book characters. Many are separated into their own groups. Some characters are superheroes and while others are non-superheroes. Out of these two types, it is the non- superheroes who are the most complex and in depth characters to understand. There is a reason to why these mortal individuals do what they do and it almost seems like they have more power than the supernatural individuals. The Phantom is one of these characters. The character of The Phantom was created by the mind of Lee Falk and has the credits to proclaim itself as the first comic book hero. Playing Kit Walker or as his alter ego, The Phantom, is actor Billy Zane. Zane is a good fit for this role. His ability to evade hostile situations is quite peculiar due to the lack of technology of the time. In a sense, he was a super human even though he never had any supernatural powers. Interesting enough, this film comes off as George of the Jungle (1997), but this time, the main character has a college education instead of being raised by gorillas. Co-starring is Zane's love interest, is Kristy Swanson, as Diana Palmer, who looks good just the way she is. Along side her is Catherine Zeta- Jones who plays Sala, an air pirate who has some comical exchanges with Swanson's character over who likes The Phantom more. Playing the main villain is Treat Williams as Xander Drax. Williams' plays Drax with finesse as if he couldn't really decide whether he should be a ruthless man with no conscience or a man who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Not to say he acted bad but there were times where Drax acted more goofy than serious. There are a lot of neat parts that take place in this movie, much of which involves The Phantom. As a moviegoer, it's not often that a chase scene includes a horse. Horses were mans original car. Just listening to the hooves of the animal clop along the ground is much easier on the ears than always listening to the roar of a V8 engine. In addition to The Phantom's horse, Hero, he has a dog, named Devil. Devil, who has a very long tongue, is also a good animal actor. Both Hero, and Devil work together to help their master in the quest for justice. Even cooler is that they can communicate to each other! And that's not all, The Phantom works with other animals too and they're just as loyal. As stated before, he's just a well-educated "George of the Jungle". The music was to fun to listen to as well. David Newman provided the soundtrack and it's great how The Phantom was able to get its own theme. I say this because there have been other films in the past that have great ideas but weren't executed right partially due to the franchise not even having a musical theme. Besides what viewers see, how else would they remember a film? By something they listen too obviously! Look at Stars Wars. No one even has to say what it is just by listening to the main theme. Lastly, the action was good too. It is very much enjoyable to see Billy Zane, Swanson and Zeta-Jones swinging swords and firing pistols at various opponents. However, some of these action sequences seemed slowed a little bit too much and too often. There were times where I was waiting for a move to end but it was moving ever so slowly that I thought it would never finish. Also the finale between The Phantom and Drax was weak. I was expecting something a little more than what I saw. But these flaws are so minor that it won't really bother the audience. Although it is not the first comic book adaptation to hit the theaters, it is an adaptation of the first comic book hero and it is done fairly well. There are some parts that may seem out of place, but overall it is a decent adventure film.

    The Phantom (Billy Zane), descendant of a line of African heroes, travels to New York to thwart a criminal genius (Treat Williams). A great cast, lead by Billy Zane, with Joe Dante producing (and almost directing). Could Bruce Campbell in the lead have made this film better? Hard to say. (I love Zane, but I have to admit he mumbles quite a bit through this film.) What I find most striking about this movie is that it has received a terrible reputation on IMDb (ranking below 5 of 10 stars), but managed to pull a 3.5 of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. Wow. Has Ebert ever been more off the mark from the common viewer? I, for one, liked it and found it a visually appealing adventure film. I especially appreciate the setting of 1930s New York, a wonderful backdrop for a crime story. I must confess I never read the comic strip, so the accuracy is something I cannot attest to. But I would have gladly welcomed a sequel, rather than have Zane go on to make "Titanic".

    This is a fun and well-made escapist film that would have, in a better world, performed much better at the box office. I blame the poor BO for The Phantom on several factors: 1) The character has limited to poor visibility in the USA, as opposed to other superheroes 2) 'Batman Returns' and 'Batman Forever,' which preceded this, were of mediocre to poor quality, thus making audiences unwilling to risk their money to see this film 3) Period pieces are a risky venture for film-makers seeking a young audience...the Rocketeer and The Shadow (both good films!) had failed to sell tickets prior to this film. This film is not intended to be the 'Citizen Kane' of superheroes and who really needs a Citzen Kane of superheroes anyway? Rather, we have an attempt to do a superhero in the style of an Indiana Jones movie, and this actually works quite well. The substance of this movie is largely good old-fashioned fight scenes, daring stunts (there's a great scene with Our Hero jumping from a flying biplane onto a running horse...great stuff!), cliffhangers, and exotic locales. There are a number of deviations from the Phantom comicstrip that might irk die-hard fans, but I have come to accept that there will always be liberties taken in these things...IMO, this adaptation retains enough of the spirit of the comics for the liberties to be forgiven. The only weak point of this film is, for me, the strange androgynous perfection of Billy Zane's face...perhaps this film was simply made at the worst moment of 1990's male aesthetic, but when Zane is not wearing his Phantom mask, he looks too much like a male prostitute for my tastes. However, when he wears the Phantom mask, Zane does indeed look, sound and act like Our Hero, so overall I was able to enjoy the film quite a lot. Other performance were completely enjoyable, especially Treat Williams as the villain and a young smoking-hot Catherine Zeta Jones as a dangerous lady pilot. Best among the supporting cast was the always great Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the Phantom's father...this character never appeared in the comics but if my own father were to come back as a ghost I'd like Patrick McGoohan to play him! (This is somewhat poignant to write this, McGoohan being dead for a few years now, him obviously being a ghost himself....) I especially appreciate this film now, since superhero films are now dominated by over-top-sadism and ultraviolence, or by confusing messes of phantasmogorical cosmic spectacle where you can't tell what the heck is happening. This film is old-fashioned fun and escapism, and if that is what you seek, you will be happy with The Phantom.

    Only read a comic book once or twice on the Phantom. So I had no preconceived notions. I give this 7 out of 10, because it was enjoyable, and I think it executed it's ideas well (it's an homage to serials I believe, like Indiana Jones.) I liked the guy who played the Phantom, he had an amusing charisma of sorts. The girl who played Diana was cute, and I enjoyed her independent woman role. Sure it's simplistic, but that's the style you go after for this genre. It's about heros and damsels in distress so to speak. The female villainess was probably the best role. She was sexy and fun.

    OK, first of all I have to state that I've never read the Phantom before - this movie introduced me to that character. So, if this movie doesn't somehow "stick" to Lee Falk's Phantom comics, I apologize. However, as movies go, this movie is written and is filmed like a movie from the time period it tried to mimic - the late 1930's/1940's. It has a great storyline and fantastic characters. It's one of the few movies that my kids and I can watch over and over again - it's just that good. I'm not sure why this movie has such a so-so review rating. In any event, give it a try and enjoy. It has everything a good movie needs - a realistic and believable hero, a great story-line and overall objective. A fantastic protagonist who is always trying to thwart our here, the Phantom. Plus, a movie that covers New York and the Jungles of Northeaster India. It's just a fantastic adventure movie.

    The plane crashes into a cliff and explodes in a great ball of fire. The only problem is that the reason it crashes is because it has run out of fuel. So what caused the fire? This about sums up the movie. There has to be some credibility in even fantasy movies such as this. The Phantom is an eerie, brooding and pitiless character who has such strange and dreadful powers that he is literally a supernatural being and one who is essentially so unearthly that mere human beings would be transfixed with terror in his presence. Yet in this movie he comes across as being a bit of a numbskull - the lights are on but there is no one home.

    I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed. The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drops charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team. Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a much for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever "humor" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. (That was one area where I thought the X-Men movies failed. Nothing memorable at all in the score ... they should have used the theme from the cartoon show. LOL) The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels. We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days. Of course its campy but its fun and a lot of hours of entertainment for the price:

"The girlfriend issue" with heroes ruined major story arcs in comics and sunk movies alike. The first Superman film was cool until Lois Lane hijacked it and there was that major boring flying scene with crappy music, and she nerfed up the second film because he threw his powers away for her resulting in all that following drama... Batman is just as bad with his string of non-girlfriends because his "mission" is all that matters, making people wonder is Robin more than just a friend? ... Spiderman...? "should i be Spidey or should I be with MJ?... why can't I have happiness" who didn't hate Tobey Maguire after that sappy dream sequence with uncle Ben??? This whole "you can't be a hero and have a loved one" nonsense is what ruins movies with boring drama filler when you just want action, and here is where the Phantom literally stands up and pees all over all other superhero movies combined, and why the Phantom is the coolest damn hero of all time; (look away if you don't want a tiny spoiler now)... The Phantom, unlike Batman, Spidey, Supes etc... any hero for that matter; and even James Bond who is kinda heroic and suave as hell with the ladies.... the Pantom, basically says to hell with all that overly-righteous self-denial hero-celibacy BS, and instead- like a don- gets both the good AND the bad girl at the end. So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so. Bottom line, Phantom is the nuts, you just gotta learn how to judge it properly and respect it's merits. Watch it, be a big kid, and let yourself enjoy it for what it's meant to be, a good old fashioned classic campy but cool adventure.

    Today there are numerous kinds of comic book characters. Many are separated into their own groups. Some characters are superheroes and while others are non-superheroes. Out of these two types, it is the non- superheroes who are the most complex and in depth characters to understand. There is a reason to why these mortal individuals do what they do and it almost seems like they have more power than the supernatural individuals. The Phantom is one of these characters. The character of The Phantom was created by the mind of Lee Falk and has the credits to proclaim itself as the first comic book hero. Playing Kit Walker or as his alter ego, The Phantom, is actor Billy Zane. Zane is a good fit for this role. His ability to evade hostile situations is quite peculiar due to the lack of technology of the time. In a sense, he was a super human even though he never had any supernatural powers. Interesting enough, this film comes off as George of the Jungle (1997), but this time, the main character has a college education instead of being raised by gorillas. Co-starring is Zane's love interest, is Kristy Swanson, as Diana Palmer, who looks good just the way she is. Along side her is Catherine Zeta- Jones who plays Sala, an air pirate who has some comical exchanges with Swanson's character over who likes The Phantom more. Playing the main villain is Treat Williams as Xander Drax. Williams' plays Drax with finesse as if he couldn't really decide whether he should be a ruthless man with no conscience or a man who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Not to say he acted bad but there were times where Drax acted more goofy than serious. There are a lot of neat parts that take place in this movie, much of which involves The Phantom. As a moviegoer, it's not often that a chase scene includes a horse. Horses were mans original car. Just listening to the hooves of the animal clop along the ground is much easier on the ears than always listening to the roar of a V8 engine. In addition to The Phantom's horse, Hero, he has a dog, named Devil. Devil, who has a very long tongue, is also a good animal actor. Both Hero, and Devil work together to help their master in the quest for justice. Even cooler is that they can communicate to each other! And that's not all, The Phantom works with other animals too and they're just as loyal. As stated before, he's just a well-educated "George of the Jungle". The music was to fun to listen to as well. David Newman provided the soundtrack and it's great how The Phantom was able to get its own theme. I say this because there have been other films in the past that have great ideas but weren't executed right partially due to the franchise not even having a musical theme. Besides what viewers see, how else would they remember a film? By something they listen too obviously! Look at Stars Wars. No one even has to say what it is just by listening to the main theme. Lastly, the action was good too. It is very much enjoyable to see Billy Zane, Swanson and Zeta-Jones swinging swords and firing pistols at various opponents. However, some of these action sequences seemed slowed a little bit too much and too often. There were times where I was waiting for a move to end but it was moving ever so slowly that I thought it would never finish. Also the finale between The Phantom and Drax was weak. I was expecting something a little more than what I saw. But these flaws are so minor that it won't really bother the audience. Although it is not the first comic book adaptation to hit the theaters, it is an adaptation of the first comic book hero and it is done fairly well. There are some parts that may seem out of place, but overall it is a decent adventure film.

    The Phantom (Billy Zane), descendant of a line of African heroes, travels to New York to thwart a criminal genius (Treat Williams). A great cast, lead by Billy Zane, with Joe Dante producing (and almost directing). Could Bruce Campbell in the lead have made this film better? Hard to say. (I love Zane, but I have to admit he mumbles quite a bit through this film.) What I find most striking about this movie is that it has received a terrible reputation on IMDb (ranking below 5 of 10 stars), but managed to pull a 3.5 of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. Wow. Has Ebert ever been more off the mark from the common viewer? I, for one, liked it and found it a visually appealing adventure film. I especially appreciate the setting of 1930s New York, a wonderful backdrop for a crime story. I must confess I never read the comic strip, so the accuracy is something I cannot attest to. But I would have gladly welcomed a sequel, rather than have Zane go on to make "Titanic".

    This is a fun and well-made escapist film that would have, in a better world, performed much better at the box office. I blame the poor BO for The Phantom on several factors: 1) The character has limited to poor visibility in the USA, as opposed to other superheroes 2) 'Batman Returns' and 'Batman Forever,' which preceded this, were of mediocre to poor quality, thus making audiences unwilling to risk their money to see this film 3) Period pieces are a risky venture for film-makers seeking a young audience...the Rocketeer and The Shadow (both good films!) had failed to sell tickets prior to this film. This film is not intended to be the 'Citizen Kane' of superheroes and who really needs a Citzen Kane of superheroes anyway? Rather, we have an attempt to do a superhero in the style of an Indiana Jones movie, and this actually works quite well. The substance of this movie is largely good old-fashioned fight scenes, daring stunts (there's a great scene with Our Hero jumping from a flying biplane onto a running horse...great stuff!), cliffhangers, and exotic locales. There are a number of deviations from the Phantom comicstrip that might irk die-hard fans, but I have come to accept that there will always be liberties taken in these things...IMO, this adaptation retains enough of the spirit of the comics for the liberties to be forgiven. The only weak point of this film is, for me, the strange androgynous perfection of Billy Zane's face...perhaps this film was simply made at the worst moment of 1990's male aesthetic, but when Zane is not wearing his Phantom mask, he looks too much like a male prostitute for my tastes. However, when he wears the Phantom mask, Zane does indeed look, sound and act like Our Hero, so overall I was able to enjoy the film quite a lot. Other performance were completely enjoyable, especially Treat Williams as the villain and a young smoking-hot Catherine Zeta Jones as a dangerous lady pilot. Best among the supporting cast was the always great Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the Phantom's father...this character never appeared in the comics but if my own father were to come back as a ghost I'd like Patrick McGoohan to play him! (This is somewhat poignant to write this, McGoohan being dead for a few years now, him obviously being a ghost himself....) I especially appreciate this film now, since superhero films are now dominated by over-top-sadism and ultraviolence, or by confusing messes of phantasmogorical cosmic spectacle where you can't tell what the heck is happening. This film is old-fashioned fun and escapism, and if that is what you seek, you will be happy with The Phantom.

    Only read a comic book once or twice on the Phantom. So I had no preconceived notions. I give this 7 out of 10, because it was enjoyable, and I think it executed it's ideas well (it's an homage to serials I believe, like Indiana Jones.) I liked the guy who played the Phantom, he had an amusing charisma of sorts. The girl who played Diana was cute, and I enjoyed her independent woman role. Sure it's simplistic, but that's the style you go after for this genre. It's about heros and damsels in distress so to speak. The female villainess was probably the best role. She was sexy and fun.

    OK, first of all I have to state that I've never read the Phantom before - this movie introduced me to that character. So, if this movie doesn't somehow "stick" to Lee Falk's Phantom comics, I apologize. However, as movies go, this movie is written and is filmed like a movie from the time period it tried to mimic - the late 1930's/1940's. It has a great storyline and fantastic characters. It's one of the few movies that my kids and I can watch over and over again - it's just that good. I'm not sure why this movie has such a so-so review rating. In any event, give it a try and enjoy. It has everything a good movie needs - a realistic and believable hero, a great story-line and overall objective. A fantastic protagonist who is always trying to thwart our here, the Phantom. Plus, a movie that covers New York and the Jungles of Northeaster India. It's just a fantastic adventure movie.

    The plane crashes into a cliff and explodes in a great ball of fire. The only problem is that the reason it crashes is because it has run out of fuel. So what caused the fire? This about sums up the movie. There has to be some credibility in even fantasy movies such as this. The Phantom is an eerie, brooding and pitiless character who has such strange and dreadful powers that he is literally a supernatural being and one who is essentially so unearthly that mere human beings would be transfixed with terror in his presence. Yet in this movie he comes across as being a bit of a numbskull - the lights are on but there is no one home.

    I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed. The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drops charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team. Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a much for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever "humor" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. (That was one area where I thought the X-Men movies failed. Nothing memorable at all in the score ... they should have used the theme from the cartoon show. LOL) The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels. We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days. Of course its campy but its fun and a lot of hours of entertainment for the price:

    Before I begin this review, I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the Phantom comic books at the time, but at least this movie caught my very interest when I watched it. Later, after my first viewing, I felt that my jaw just dropped because I can't believe that I just watched a completely underrated superhero movie next to The Rocketeer which I thought was a fun and excellent film. But the reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it has some flaws. The story does have the spirit and tone of the comics in which I've heard and it has a style of Indiana Jones which works perfectly, but it suffers from a cookie-cutter plot about the Skulls of Touganda, the final battle between The Phantom and Drax was a disappointment and the romance scenes between Kit Walker and Diana would've been developed. But, with that said, everything else works in this movie. The acting is fabulous. Billy Zane, who would later play Cale Hockley in James Cameron's Titanic, did a great job as the title role and handled the character's traits perfectly. Treat Williams did a fine job hamming his role as the villain by being funny rather than serious, Kristy Swanson did great as the lovely Diana and Catherine Zeta Jones, the most hottest actress in cinema history, did great as the ally for Drax. The directing from Simon Wincer (who directed Free Willy) is pretty decent and the cinematography and landscapes are the epitome of magnificence. The strongest aspects goes to the amazingly intense action sequences and David Newman's adequately amazing music score and I liked how the title character gets it's own theme song like most movie franchises have. Overall, The Phantom isn't a great movie, but it's a comic book superhero movie that works brilliant in an Indiana Jones-esque style and it's worth watching. That's all I have to say. It is *that* good!

    I've been a huge fan of the Phantom from a young age and was excited to finally watch the (unfortunately) only movie this superhero had spawned. The plot is pretty simple, in keeping with the action films of that time- involving three legendary skulls which when combined generate an earth shattering force that can be used for world domination. The villain Xander Drax, an evil multi-millionaire, wants it by any means and the Phantom is the only one who can stop him. The action is non-stop from the first scene and to accommodate so much in the 90 odd minutes of screen-time, the director compromises on describing the origin of the Phantom and the icons associated with him. No mention is made of the mark that the Skull ring leaves when the Phantom punches (we're just given a hint) or the presence of the other ring- the one of protection. Even the name of the Phantom's trusty steed - Hero- is not mentioned, although the horse itself gets a meaty role (not as much as Devil, his pet wolf). Billy Zane portrays the superhero as a smooth talking, elegant crime-fighter- more like a James Bond in a purple tight-suit, with a punch here and a quip there. In that, he is less intense as the Phantom than I would have liked but it sure suits the movie's style- more camp and camaraderie than outright gritty realism. However, the character is shown true to the comic books, in that he's loyal, charming, morally upright, courageous and fights evil unselfishly. The stunts are realistic (he's clearly shown as human and beatable) and true to the Phantom's tradition (The Phantom always shoots to disarm), he does not kill anyone. Just like in the comics, romance is subtle and restricted to just a few kisses and the ladies are just as gorgeous as the Phantom is strong and handsome. And they're not just eye candy- and have good roles. The villains have enough screen-time to be shown as evil and hard to beat. Do not compare this to movies like Nolan's Batman since this was taken in a completely different era and the Phantom himself does not possess as many gadgets as the rich and sophisticated Batman. He relies on his speed, strength, intelligence, and friends to settle matters. My only disappointment is that this could have been a much better movie if the origins had been described so people can distinguish him from other similar superheroes living double lives (most notably Batman). As a film, I'll give it a 6 or 7 but since it is the only film of the Phantom, my loyalty forces me to give it a 10. If this movie piques your curiosity to check out the diverse and exciting world of the Phantom comics, it would have gotten it's due.

    OK yes a nine is high, but I'm judging it against all other hero movies of the time. Compared to modern movies like Avengers, the Batman reboots etc Id give it maybe a 6 or 7 mainly for the comparative lack of big budget action and effects only. Story wise, this film still kills them imo. Action wise and feel this movie has the globetrotting and backdrops and mystique that make it fit in nicely alongside Indie, Tomb Raider, the Mummy franchise; whilst retaining that roots-comic book feel captured so well in the 90s Batman: The Animated Series, and The Shadow... Just look for the scene where Zane, in his coat and hat, steals a skull and jumps through a window holding it in his hand, staring at it before looking up, the dynamism and cinematography is lifted right from the pages of a comic. You've got rickety collapsing bridges, heroines, sexy villain girls, planes, gunfights, pirates, gangsters, daring stunts, secret islands, magic weapons of mass destruction, Billy Zane just being his usual coolest man alive self... yes it's at times cheesy, yes its cornball but its a movie based on a hero who wears a purple skintight babygrow, how else are you gonna make it? It has to be. You gotta suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a comic book movie. You can't watch Superman and criticise it by saying the guy defied the laws of gravity! That's rubbish. This film gets some things pretty bad, a few of the effects, notably at the end, are pretty low budget, the sets are obviously sets, fight choreography is a little laughable... however in many ways this all adds to its charm, and character. The cast are superb, from Cary as the pirate leader, James Remar as the menacing yet cool goon, to Treat Williams' superbly charismatic yet evil badguy, and the tough-to-tell-who-is-more-beautiful Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. To cap it off Billy Zane is there as the lead, I don't know what else to say here... who else can pull of wearing the Phantom's suit and still look manly other than Billy Zane, the coolest man in movies? I am straight as an arrow, loooove women... and I would even have sex with Billy Zane, and the thing is... he is just so damn cool and manly that somehow - magically - it would still be totally heterosexual because the guy is just that epic and exudes pure distilled awesomeness. I could be at a bar after and tell my guy mates, "hey... just had sex with a guy, it was Billy Zane" and they'd all be like "oh... fair play, thats cool". No homophobia or judgement or loss of masculinity at all, just because its Billy Zane. In short, he wears a purple catsuit, and he is cool as hell still. ...now, people will judge this... they will say the film is lame, cheesy etc, that the Phantom is rubbish and base this all purely on the subject matter more than anything else, i.e. how he looks, why he uses guns but doesn't kill etc... things the film can't help because it's the character itself and story that dictates it... they are on dangerous ground here. Consider Superman, consider the Batman films, consider Spiderman... all these are perhaps the top three recognisable heroes of all time... all of their films suffered the same major problem which irritated fans... what I call "the girlfriend issue". "The girlfriend issue" with heroes ruined major story arcs in comics and sunk movies alike. The first Superman film was cool until Lois Lane hijacked it and there was that major boring flying scene with crappy music, and she nerfed up the second film because he threw his powers away for her resulting in all that following drama... Batman is just as bad with his string of non-girlfriends because his "mission" is all that matters, making people wonder is Robin more than just a friend? ... Spiderman...? "should i be Spidey or should I be with MJ?... why can't I have happiness" who didn't hate Tobey Maguire after that sappy dream sequence with uncle Ben???

So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so.

Rather, we have an attempt to do a superhero in the style of an Indiana Jones movie, and this actually works quite well. The substance of this movie is largely good old-fashioned fight scenes, daring stunts (there's a great scene with Our Hero jumping from a flying biplane onto a running horse...great stuff!), cliffhangers, and exotic locales. There are a number of deviations from the Phantom comicstrip that might irk die-hard fans, but I have come to accept that there will always be liberties taken in these things...IMO, this adaptation retains enough of the spirit of the comics for the liberties to be forgiven. The only weak point of this film is, for me, the strange androgynous perfection of Billy Zane's face...perhaps this film was simply made at the worst moment of 1990's male aesthetic, but when Zane is not wearing his Phantom mask, he looks too much like a male prostitute for my tastes. However, when he wears the Phantom mask, Zane does indeed look, sound and act like Our Hero, so overall I was able to enjoy the film quite a lot. Other performance were completely enjoyable, especially Treat Williams as the villain and a young smoking-hot Catherine Zeta Jones as a dangerous lady pilot. Best among the supporting cast was the always great Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the Phantom's father...this character never appeared in the comics but if my own father were to come back as a ghost I'd like Patrick McGoohan to play him! (This is somewhat poignant to write this, McGoohan being dead for a few years now, him obviously being a ghost himself....) I especially appreciate this film now, since superhero films are now dominated by over-top-sadism and ultraviolence, or by confusing messes of phantasmogorical cosmic spectacle where you can't tell what the heck is happening. This film is old-fashioned fun and escapism, and if that is what you seek, you will be happy with The Phantom.

    Only read a comic book once or twice on the Phantom. So I had no preconceived notions. I give this 7 out of 10, because it was enjoyable, and I think it executed it's ideas well (it's an homage to serials I believe, like Indiana Jones.) I liked the guy who played the Phantom, he had an amusing charisma of sorts. The girl who played Diana was cute, and I enjoyed her independent woman role. Sure it's simplistic, but that's the style you go after for this genre. It's about heros and damsels in distress so to speak. The female villainess was probably the best role. She was sexy and fun.

    OK, first of all I have to state that I've never read the Phantom before - this movie introduced me to that character. So, if this movie doesn't somehow "stick" to Lee Falk's Phantom comics, I apologize. However, as movies go, this movie is written and is filmed like a movie from the time period it tried to mimic - the late 1930's/1940's. It has a great storyline and fantastic characters. It's one of the few movies that my kids and I can watch over and over again - it's just that good. I'm not sure why this movie has such a so-so review rating. In any event, give it a try and enjoy. It has everything a good movie needs - a realistic and believable hero, a great story-line and overall objective. A fantastic protagonist who is always trying to thwart our here, the Phantom. Plus, a movie that covers New York and the Jungles of Northeaster India. It's just a fantastic adventure movie.

    The plane crashes into a cliff and explodes in a great ball of fire. The only problem is that the reason it crashes is because it has run out of fuel. So what caused the fire? This about sums up the movie. There has to be some credibility in even fantasy movies such as this. The Phantom is an eerie, brooding and pitiless character who has such strange and dreadful powers that he is literally a supernatural being and one who is essentially so unearthly that mere human beings would be transfixed with terror in his presence. Yet in this movie he comes across as being a bit of a numbskull - the lights are on but there is no one home.

    I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed. The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drops charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team. Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a much for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever "humor" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. (That was one area where I thought the X-Men movies failed. Nothing memorable at all in the score ... they should have used the theme from the cartoon show. LOL) The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels. We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days. Of course its campy but its fun and a lot of hours of entertainment for the price:

    Before I begin this review, I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the Phantom comic books at the time, but at least this movie caught my very interest when I watched it. Later, after my first viewing, I felt that my jaw just dropped because I can't believe that I just watched a completely underrated superhero movie next to The Rocketeer which I thought was a fun and excellent film. But the reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it has some flaws. The story does have the spirit and tone of the comics in which I've heard and it has a style of Indiana Jones which works perfectly, but it suffers from a cookie-cutter plot about the Skulls of Touganda, the final battle between The Phantom and Drax was a disappointment and the romance scenes between Kit Walker and Diana would've been developed. But, with that said, everything else works in this movie. The acting is fabulous. Billy Zane, who would later play Cale Hockley in James Cameron's Titanic, did a great job as the title role and handled the character's traits perfectly. Treat Williams did a fine job hamming his role as the villain by being funny rather than serious, Kristy Swanson did great as the lovely Diana and Catherine Zeta Jones, the most hottest actress in cinema history, did great as the ally for Drax. The directing from Simon Wincer (who directed Free Willy) is pretty decent and the cinematography and landscapes are the epitome of magnificence. The strongest aspects goes to the amazingly intense action sequences and David Newman's adequately amazing music score and I liked how the title character gets it's own theme song like most movie franchises have. Overall, The Phantom isn't a great movie, but it's a comic book superhero movie that works brilliant in an Indiana Jones-esque style and it's worth watching. That's all I have to say. It is *that* good!

    I've been a huge fan of the Phantom from a young age and was excited to finally watch the (unfortunately) only movie this superhero had spawned. The plot is pretty simple, in keeping with the action films of that time- involving three legendary skulls which when combined generate an earth shattering force that can be used for world domination. The villain Xander Drax, an evil multi-millionaire, wants it by any means and the Phantom is the only one who can stop him. The action is non-stop from the first scene and to accommodate so much in the 90 odd minutes of screen-time, the director compromises on describing the origin of the Phantom and the icons associated with him. No mention is made of the mark that the Skull ring leaves when the Phantom punches (we're just given a hint) or the presence of the other ring- the one of protection. Even the name of the Phantom's trusty steed - Hero- is not mentioned, although the horse itself gets a meaty role (not as much as Devil, his pet wolf). Billy Zane portrays the superhero as a smooth talking, elegant crime-fighter- more like a James Bond in a purple tight-suit, with a punch here and a quip there. In that, he is less intense as the Phantom than I would have liked but it sure suits the movie's style- more camp and camaraderie than outright gritty realism. However, the character is shown true to the comic books, in that he's loyal, charming, morally upright, courageous and fights evil unselfishly. The stunts are realistic (he's clearly shown as human and beatable) and true to the Phantom's tradition (The Phantom always shoots to disarm), he does not kill anyone. Just like in the comics, romance is subtle and restricted to just a few kisses and the ladies are just as gorgeous as the Phantom is strong and handsome. And they're not just eye candy- and have good roles. The villains have enough screen-time to be shown as evil and hard to beat. Do not compare this to movies like Nolan's Batman since this was taken in a completely different era and the Phantom himself does not possess as many gadgets as the rich and sophisticated Batman. He relies on his speed, strength, intelligence, and friends to settle matters. My only disappointment is that this could have been a much better movie if the origins had been described so people can distinguish him from other similar superheroes living double lives (most notably Batman). As a film, I'll give it a 6 or 7 but since it is the only film of the Phantom, my loyalty forces me to give it a 10. If this movie piques your curiosity to check out the diverse and exciting world of the Phantom comics, it would have gotten it's due.

    OK yes a nine is high, but I'm judging it against all other hero movies of the time. Compared to modern movies like Avengers, the Batman reboots etc Id give it maybe a 6 or 7 mainly for the comparative lack of big budget action and effects only. Story wise, this film still kills them imo. Action wise and feel this movie has the globetrotting and backdrops and mystique that make it fit in nicely alongside Indie, Tomb Raider, the Mummy franchise; whilst retaining that roots-comic book feel captured so well in the 90s Batman: The Animated Series, and The Shadow... Just look for the scene where Zane, in his coat and hat, steals a skull and jumps through a window holding it in his hand, staring at it before looking up, the dynamism and cinematography is lifted right from the pages of a comic. You've got rickety collapsing bridges, heroines, sexy villain girls, planes, gunfights, pirates, gangsters, daring stunts, secret islands, magic weapons of mass destruction, Billy Zane just being his usual coolest man alive self... yes it's at times cheesy, yes its cornball but its a movie based on a hero who wears a purple skintight babygrow, how else are you gonna make it? It has to be. You gotta suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a comic book movie. You can't watch Superman and criticise it by saying the guy defied the laws of gravity! That's rubbish. This film gets some things pretty bad, a few of the effects, notably at the end, are pretty low budget, the sets are obviously sets, fight choreography is a little laughable... however in many ways this all adds to its charm, and character. The cast are superb, from Cary as the pirate leader, James Remar as the menacing yet cool goon, to Treat Williams' superbly charismatic yet evil badguy, and the tough-to-tell-who-is-more-beautiful Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. To cap it off Billy Zane is there as the lead, I don't know what else to say here... who else can pull of wearing the Phantom's suit and still look manly other than Billy Zane, the coolest man in movies? I am straight as an arrow, loooove women... and I would even have sex with Billy Zane, and the thing is... he is just so damn cool and manly that somehow - magically - it would still be totally heterosexual because the guy is just that epic and exudes pure distilled awesomeness. I could be at a bar after and tell my guy mates, "hey... just had sex with a guy, it was Billy Zane" and they'd all be like "oh... fair play, thats cool". No homophobia or judgement or loss of masculinity at all, just because its Billy Zane. In short, he wears a purple catsuit, and he is cool as hell still. ...now, people will judge this... they will say the film is lame, cheesy etc, that the Phantom is rubbish and base this all purely on the subject matter more than anything else, i.e. how he looks, why he uses guns but doesn't kill etc... things the film can't help because it's the character itself and story that dictates it... they are on dangerous ground here. Consider Superman, consider the Batman films, consider Spiderman... all these are perhaps the top three recognisable heroes of all time... all of their films suffered the same major problem which irritated fans... what I call "the girlfriend issue". "The girlfriend issue" with heroes ruined major story arcs in comics and sunk movies alike. The first Superman film was cool until Lois Lane hijacked it and there was that major boring flying scene with crappy music, and she nerfed up the second film because he threw his powers away for her resulting in all that following drama... Batman is just as bad with his string of non-girlfriends because his "mission" is all that matters, making people wonder is Robin more than just a friend? ... Spiderman...? "should i be Spidey or should I be with MJ?... why can't I have happiness" who didn't hate Tobey Maguire after that sappy dream sequence with uncle Ben??? This whole "you can't be a hero and have a loved one" nonsense is what ruins movies with boring drama filler when you just want action, and here is where the Phantom literally stands up and pees all over all other superhero movies combined, and why the Phantom is the coolest damn hero of all time; (look away if you don't want a tiny spoiler now)... The Phantom, unlike Batman, Spidey, Supes etc... any hero for that matter; and even James Bond who is kinda heroic and suave as hell with the ladies.... the Pantom, basically says to hell with all that overly-righteous self-denial hero-celibacy BS, and instead- like a don- gets both the good AND the bad girl at the end. So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so. Bottom line, Phantom is the nuts, you just gotta learn how to judge it properly and respect it's merits. Watch it, be a big kid, and let yourself enjoy it for what it's meant to be, a good old fashioned classic campy but cool adventure.

    Today there are numerous kinds of comic book characters. Many are separated into their own groups. Some characters are superheroes and while others are non-superheroes. Out of these two types, it is the non- superheroes who are the most complex and in depth characters to understand. There is a reason to why these mortal individuals do what they do and it almost seems like they have more power than the supernatural individuals. The Phantom is one of these characters. The character of The Phantom was created by the mind of Lee Falk and has the credits to proclaim itself as the first comic book hero. Playing Kit Walker or as his alter ego, The Phantom, is actor Billy Zane. Zane is a good fit for this role. His ability to evade hostile situations is quite peculiar due to the lack of technology of the time. In a sense, he was a super human even though he never had any supernatural powers. Interesting enough, this film comes off as George of the Jungle (1997), but this time, the main character has a college education instead of being raised by gorillas. Co-starring is Zane's love interest, is Kristy Swanson, as Diana Palmer, who looks good just the way she is. Along side her is Catherine Zeta- Jones who plays Sala, an air pirate who has some comical exchanges with Swanson's character over who likes The Phantom more. Playing the main villain is Treat Williams as Xander Drax. Williams' plays Drax with finesse as if he couldn't really decide whether he should be a ruthless man with no conscience or a man who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Not to say he acted bad but there were times where Drax acted more goofy than serious. There are a lot of neat parts that take place in this movie, much of which involves The Phantom. As a moviegoer, it's not often that a chase scene includes a horse. Horses were mans original car. Just listening to the hooves of the animal clop along the ground is much easier on the ears than always listening to the roar of a V8 engine. In addition to The Phantom's horse, Hero, he has a dog, named Devil. Devil, who has a very long tongue, is also a good animal actor. Both Hero, and Devil work together to help their master in the quest for justice. Even cooler is that they can communicate to each other! And that's not all, The Phantom works with other animals too and they're just as loyal. As stated before, he's just a well-educated "George of the Jungle". The music was to fun to listen to as well. David Newman provided the soundtrack and it's great how The Phantom was able to get its own theme. I say this because there have been other films in the past that have great ideas but weren't executed right partially due to the franchise not even having a musical theme. Besides what viewers see, how else would they remember a film? By something they listen too obviously! Look at Stars Wars. No one even has to say what it is just by listening to the main theme. Lastly, the action was good too. It is very much enjoyable to see Billy Zane, Swanson and Zeta-Jones swinging swords and firing pistols at various opponents. However, some of these action sequences seemed slowed a little bit too much and too often. There were times where I was waiting for a move to end but it was moving ever so slowly that I thought it would never finish. Also the finale between The Phantom and Drax was weak. I was expecting something a little more than what I saw. But these flaws are so minor that it won't really bother the audience. Although it is not the first comic book adaptation to hit the theaters, it is an adaptation of the first comic book hero and it is done fairly well. There are some parts that may seem out of place, but overall it is a decent adventure film.

    The Phantom (Billy Zane), descendant of a line of African heroes, travels to New York to thwart a criminal genius (Treat Williams). A great cast, lead by Billy Zane, with Joe Dante producing (and almost directing). Could Bruce Campbell in the lead have made this film better? Hard to say. (I love Zane, but I have to admit he mumbles quite a bit through this film.) What I find most striking about this movie is that it has received a terrible reputation on IMDb (ranking below 5 of 10 stars), but managed to pull a 3.5 of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. Wow. Has Ebert ever been more off the mark from the common viewer? I, for one, liked it and found it a visually appealing adventure film. I especially appreciate the setting of 1930s New York, a wonderful backdrop for a crime story. I must confess I never read the comic strip, so the accuracy is something I cannot attest to. But I would have gladly welcomed a sequel, rather than have Zane go on to make "Titanic".

    This is a fun and well-made escapist film that would have, in a better world, performed much better at the box office.

Billy Zane, who would later play Cale Hockley in James Cameron's Titanic, did a great job as the title role and handled the character's traits perfectly. Treat Williams did a fine job hamming his role as the villain by being funny rather than serious, Kristy Swanson did great as the lovely Diana and Catherine Zeta Jones, the most hottest actress in cinema history, did great as the ally for Drax. The directing from Simon Wincer (who directed Free Willy) is pretty decent and the cinematography and landscapes are the epitome of magnificence. The strongest aspects goes to the amazingly intense action sequences and David Newman's adequately amazing music score and I liked how the title character gets it's own theme song like most movie franchises have. Overall, The Phantom isn't a great movie, but it's a comic book superhero movie that works brilliant in an Indiana Jones-esque style and it's worth watching. That's all I have to say. It is *that* good!

    I've been a huge fan of the Phantom from a young age and was excited to finally watch the (unfortunately) only movie this superhero had spawned. The plot is pretty simple, in keeping with the action films of that time- involving three legendary skulls which when combined generate an earth shattering force that can be used for world domination. The villain Xander Drax, an evil multi-millionaire, wants it by any means and the Phantom is the only one who can stop him. The action is non-stop from the first scene and to accommodate so much in the 90 odd minutes of screen-time, the director compromises on describing the origin of the Phantom and the icons associated with him. No mention is made of the mark that the Skull ring leaves when the Phantom punches (we're just given a hint) or the presence of the other ring- the one of protection. Even the name of the Phantom's trusty steed - Hero- is not mentioned, although the horse itself gets a meaty role (not as much as Devil, his pet wolf). Billy Zane portrays the superhero as a smooth talking, elegant crime-fighter- more like a James Bond in a purple tight-suit, with a punch here and a quip there. In that, he is less intense as the Phantom than I would have liked but it sure suits the movie's style- more camp and camaraderie than outright gritty realism. However, the character is shown true to the comic books, in that he's loyal, charming, morally upright, courageous and fights evil unselfishly. The stunts are realistic (he's clearly shown as human and beatable) and true to the Phantom's tradition (The Phantom always shoots to disarm), he does not kill anyone. Just like in the comics, romance is subtle and restricted to just a few kisses and the ladies are just as gorgeous as the Phantom is strong and handsome. And they're not just eye candy- and have good roles. The villains have enough screen-time to be shown as evil and hard to beat. Do not compare this to movies like Nolan's Batman since this was taken in a completely different era and the Phantom himself does not possess as many gadgets as the rich and sophisticated Batman. He relies on his speed, strength, intelligence, and friends to settle matters. My only disappointment is that this could have been a much better movie if the origins had been described so people can distinguish him from other similar superheroes living double lives (most notably Batman). As a film, I'll give it a 6 or 7 but since it is the only film of the Phantom, my loyalty forces me to give it a 10. If this movie piques your curiosity to check out the diverse and exciting world of the Phantom comics, it would have gotten it's due.

    OK yes a nine is high, but I'm judging it against all other hero movies of the time. Compared to modern movies like Avengers, the Batman reboots etc Id give it maybe a 6 or 7 mainly for the comparative lack of big budget action and effects only. Story wise, this film still kills them imo. Action wise and feel this movie has the globetrotting and backdrops and mystique that make it fit in nicely alongside Indie, Tomb Raider, the Mummy franchise; whilst retaining that roots-comic book feel captured so well in the 90s Batman: The Animated Series, and The Shadow... Just look for the scene where Zane, in his coat and hat, steals a skull and jumps through a window holding it in his hand, staring at it before looking up, the dynamism and cinematography is lifted right from the pages of a comic. You've got rickety collapsing bridges, heroines, sexy villain girls, planes, gunfights, pirates, gangsters, daring stunts, secret islands, magic weapons of mass destruction, Billy Zane just being his usual coolest man alive self... yes it's at times cheesy, yes its cornball but its a movie based on a hero who wears a purple skintight babygrow, how else are you gonna make it? It has to be. You gotta suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a comic book movie. You can't watch Superman and criticise it by saying the guy defied the laws of gravity! That's rubbish. This film gets some things pretty bad, a few of the effects, notably at the end, are pretty low budget, the sets are obviously sets, fight choreography is a little laughable... however in many ways this all adds to its charm, and character. The cast are superb, from Cary as the pirate leader, James Remar as the menacing yet cool goon, to Treat Williams' superbly charismatic yet evil badguy, and the tough-to-tell-who-is-more-beautiful Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. To cap it off Billy Zane is there as the lead, I don't know what else to say here... who else can pull of wearing the Phantom's suit and still look manly other than Billy Zane, the coolest man in movies? I am straight as an arrow, loooove women... and I would even have sex with Billy Zane, and the thing is... he is just so damn cool and manly that somehow - magically - it would still be totally heterosexual because the guy is just that epic and exudes pure distilled awesomeness. I could be at a bar after and tell my guy mates, "hey... just had sex with a guy, it was Billy Zane" and they'd all be like "oh... fair play, thats cool". No homophobia or judgement or loss of masculinity at all, just because its Billy Zane. In short, he wears a purple catsuit, and he is cool as hell still. ...now, people will judge this... they will say the film is lame, cheesy etc, that the Phantom is rubbish and base this all purely on the subject matter more than anything else, i.e. how he looks, why he uses guns but doesn't kill etc... things the film can't help because it's the character itself and story that dictates it... they are on dangerous ground here. Consider Superman, consider the Batman films, consider Spiderman... all these are perhaps the top three recognisable heroes of all time... all of their films suffered the same major problem which irritated fans... what I call "the girlfriend issue". "The girlfriend issue" with heroes ruined major story arcs in comics and sunk movies alike. The first Superman film was cool until Lois Lane hijacked it and there was that major boring flying scene with crappy music, and she nerfed up the second film because he threw his powers away for her resulting in all that following drama... Batman is just as bad with his string of non-girlfriends because his "mission" is all that matters, making people wonder is Robin more than just a friend? ... Spiderman...? "should i be Spidey or should I be with MJ?... why can't I have happiness" who didn't hate Tobey Maguire after that sappy dream sequence with uncle Ben??? This whole "you can't be a hero and have a loved one" nonsense is what ruins movies with boring drama filler when you just want action, and here is where the Phantom literally stands up and pees all over all other superhero movies combined, and why the Phantom is the coolest damn hero of all time; (look away if you don't want a tiny spoiler now)... The Phantom, unlike Batman, Spidey, Supes etc... any hero for that matter; and even James Bond who is kinda heroic and suave as hell with the ladies.... the Pantom, basically says to hell with all that overly-righteous self-denial hero-celibacy BS, and instead- like a don- gets both the good AND the bad girl at the end. So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so. Bottom line, Phantom is the nuts, you just gotta learn how to judge it properly and respect it's merits. Watch it, be a big kid, and let yourself enjoy it for what it's meant to be, a good old fashioned classic campy but cool adventure.

    Today there are numerous kinds of comic book characters. Many are separated into their own groups. Some characters are superheroes and while others are non-superheroes. Out of these two types, it is the non- superheroes who are the most complex and in depth characters to understand. There is a reason to why these mortal individuals do what they do and it almost seems like they have more power than the supernatural individuals. The Phantom is one of these characters. The character of The Phantom was created by the mind of Lee Falk and has the credits to proclaim itself as the first comic book hero. Playing Kit Walker or as his alter ego, The Phantom, is actor Billy Zane. Zane is a good fit for this role. His ability to evade hostile situations is quite peculiar due to the lack of technology of the time. In a sense, he was a super human even though he never had any supernatural powers. Interesting enough, this film comes off as George of the Jungle (1997), but this time, the main character has a college education instead of being raised by gorillas. Co-starring is Zane's love interest, is Kristy Swanson, as Diana Palmer, who looks good just the way she is. Along side her is Catherine Zeta- Jones who plays Sala, an air pirate who has some comical exchanges with Swanson's character over who likes The Phantom more. Playing the main villain is Treat Williams as Xander Drax. Williams' plays Drax with finesse as if he couldn't really decide whether he should be a ruthless man with no conscience or a man who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Not to say he acted bad but there were times where Drax acted more goofy than serious. There are a lot of neat parts that take place in this movie, much of which involves The Phantom. As a moviegoer, it's not often that a chase scene includes a horse. Horses were mans original car. Just listening to the hooves of the animal clop along the ground is much easier on the ears than always listening to the roar of a V8 engine. In addition to The Phantom's horse, Hero, he has a dog, named Devil. Devil, who has a very long tongue, is also a good animal actor. Both Hero, and Devil work together to help their master in the quest for justice. Even cooler is that they can communicate to each other! And that's not all, The Phantom works with other animals too and they're just as loyal. As stated before, he's just a well-educated "George of the Jungle". The music was to fun to listen to as well. David Newman provided the soundtrack and it's great how The Phantom was able to get its own theme. I say this because there have been other films in the past that have great ideas but weren't executed right partially due to the franchise not even having a musical theme. Besides what viewers see, how else would they remember a film? By something they listen too obviously! Look at Stars Wars. No one even has to say what it is just by listening to the main theme. Lastly, the action was good too. It is very much enjoyable to see Billy Zane, Swanson and Zeta-Jones swinging swords and firing pistols at various opponents. However, some of these action sequences seemed slowed a little bit too much and too often. There were times where I was waiting for a move to end but it was moving ever so slowly that I thought it would never finish. Also the finale between The Phantom and Drax was weak. I was expecting something a little more than what I saw. But these flaws are so minor that it won't really bother the audience. Although it is not the first comic book adaptation to hit the theaters, it is an adaptation of the first comic book hero and it is done fairly well. There are some parts that may seem out of place, but overall it is a decent adventure film.

    The Phantom (Billy Zane), descendant of a line of African heroes, travels to New York to thwart a criminal genius (Treat Williams). A great cast, lead by Billy Zane, with Joe Dante producing (and almost directing). Could Bruce Campbell in the lead have made this film better? Hard to say. (I love Zane, but I have to admit he mumbles quite a bit through this film.) What I find most striking about this movie is that it has received a terrible reputation on IMDb (ranking below 5 of 10 stars), but managed to pull a 3.5 of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. Wow. Has Ebert ever been more off the mark from the common viewer? I, for one, liked it and found it a visually appealing adventure film. I especially appreciate the setting of 1930s New York, a wonderful backdrop for a crime story. I must confess I never read the comic strip, so the accuracy is something I cannot attest to. But I would have gladly welcomed a sequel, rather than have Zane go on to make "Titanic".

    This is a fun and well-made escapist film that would have, in a better world, performed much better at the box office. I blame the poor BO for The Phantom on several factors: 1) The character has limited to poor visibility in the USA, as opposed to other superheroes 2) 'Batman Returns' and 'Batman Forever,' which preceded this, were of mediocre to poor quality, thus making audiences unwilling to risk their money to see this film 3) Period pieces are a risky venture for film-makers seeking a young audience...the Rocketeer and The Shadow (both good films!) had failed to sell tickets prior to this film. This film is not intended to be the 'Citizen Kane' of superheroes and who really needs a Citzen Kane of superheroes anyway? Rather, we have an attempt to do a superhero in the style of an Indiana Jones movie, and this actually works quite well. The substance of this movie is largely good old-fashioned fight scenes, daring stunts (there's a great scene with Our Hero jumping from a flying biplane onto a running horse...great stuff!), cliffhangers, and exotic locales. There are a number of deviations from the Phantom comicstrip that might irk die-hard fans, but I have come to accept that there will always be liberties taken in these things...IMO, this adaptation retains enough of the spirit of the comics for the liberties to be forgiven. The only weak point of this film is, for me, the strange androgynous perfection of Billy Zane's face...perhaps this film was simply made at the worst moment of 1990's male aesthetic, but when Zane is not wearing his Phantom mask, he looks too much like a male prostitute for my tastes. However, when he wears the Phantom mask, Zane does indeed look, sound and act like Our Hero, so overall I was able to enjoy the film quite a lot. Other performance were completely enjoyable, especially Treat Williams as the villain and a young smoking-hot Catherine Zeta Jones as a dangerous lady pilot. Best among the supporting cast was the always great Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the Phantom's father...this character never appeared in the comics but if my own father were to come back as a ghost I'd like Patrick McGoohan to play him! (This is somewhat poignant to write this, McGoohan being dead for a few years now, him obviously being a ghost himself....) I especially appreciate this film now, since superhero films are now dominated by over-top-sadism and ultraviolence, or by confusing messes of phantasmogorical cosmic spectacle where you can't tell what the heck is happening. This film is old-fashioned fun and escapism, and if that is what you seek, you will be happy with The Phantom.

    Only read a comic book once or twice on the Phantom. So I had no preconceived notions. I give this 7 out of 10, because it was enjoyable, and I think it executed it's ideas well (it's an homage to serials I believe, like Indiana Jones.) I liked the guy who played the Phantom, he had an amusing charisma of sorts. The girl who played Diana was cute, and I enjoyed her independent woman role. Sure it's simplistic, but that's the style you go after for this genre. It's about heros and damsels in distress so to speak. The female villainess was probably the best role. She was sexy and fun.

    OK, first of all I have to state that I've never read the Phantom before - this movie introduced me to that character. So, if this movie doesn't somehow "stick" to Lee Falk's Phantom comics, I apologize. However, as movies go, this movie is written and is filmed like a movie from the time period it tried to mimic - the late 1930's/1940's. It has a great storyline and fantastic characters. It's one of the few movies that my kids and I can watch over and over again - it's just that good. I'm not sure why this movie has such a so-so review rating. In any event, give it a try and enjoy. It has everything a good movie needs - a realistic and believable hero, a great story-line and overall objective. A fantastic protagonist who is always trying to thwart our here, the Phantom. Plus, a movie that covers New York and the Jungles of Northeaster India. It's just a fantastic adventure movie.

    The plane crashes into a cliff and explodes in a great ball of fire. The only problem is that the reason it crashes is because it has run out of fuel. So what caused the fire? This about sums up the movie. There has to be some credibility in even fantasy movies such as this. The Phantom is an eerie, brooding and pitiless character who has such strange and dreadful powers that he is literally a supernatural being and one who is essentially so unearthly that mere human beings would be transfixed with terror in his presence. Yet in this movie he comes across as being a bit of a numbskull - the lights are on but there is no one home.

    I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed. The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drops charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team. Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a much for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever "humor" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. (That was one area where I thought the X-Men movies failed. Nothing memorable at all in the score ... they should have used the theme from the cartoon show. LOL) The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels. We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days. Of course its campy but its fun and a lot of hours of entertainment for the price:

    Before I begin this review, I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the Phantom comic books at the time, but at least this movie caught my very interest when I watched it. Later, after my first viewing, I felt that my jaw just dropped because I can't believe that I just watched a completely underrated superhero movie next to The Rocketeer which I thought was a fun and excellent film. But the reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it has some flaws. The story does have the spirit and tone of the comics in which I've heard and it has a style of Indiana Jones which works perfectly, but it suffers from a cookie-cutter plot about the Skulls of Touganda, the final battle between The Phantom and Drax was a disappointment and the romance scenes between Kit Walker and Diana would've been developed. But, with that said, everything else works in this movie. The acting is fabulous.

So you have tons of action, around the world heroics, true to the cheesiness classic comic-booky adventure, a phenomenal, lovable cast, and a hero that doesn't give a damn about convention, because he can land a hot blonde damsel and a vampish bad-girl even whilst wearing a purple bodystocking... lets see Christian Bale try to do that whilst chatting up the ladies in his "I'm on the toilet straining hard" voice, he'll need a pretty awesome gadget to pull that trick off... no? not taking that bet? ...didn't think so. Bottom line, Phantom is the nuts, you just gotta learn how to judge it properly and respect it's merits. Watch it, be a big kid, and let yourself enjoy it for what it's meant to be, a good old fashioned classic campy but cool adventure.

    Today there are numerous kinds of comic book characters. Many are separated into their own groups. Some characters are superheroes and while others are non-superheroes. Out of these two types, it is the non- superheroes who are the most complex and in depth characters to understand. There is a reason to why these mortal individuals do what they do and it almost seems like they have more power than the supernatural individuals. The Phantom is one of these characters. The character of The Phantom was created by the mind of Lee Falk and has the credits to proclaim itself as the first comic book hero. Playing Kit Walker or as his alter ego, The Phantom, is actor Billy Zane. Zane is a good fit for this role. His ability to evade hostile situations is quite peculiar due to the lack of technology of the time. In a sense, he was a super human even though he never had any supernatural powers. Interesting enough, this film comes off as George of the Jungle (1997), but this time, the main character has a college education instead of being raised by gorillas. Co-starring is Zane's love interest, is Kristy Swanson, as Diana Palmer, who looks good just the way she is. Along side her is Catherine Zeta- Jones who plays Sala, an air pirate who has some comical exchanges with Swanson's character over who likes The Phantom more. Playing the main villain is Treat Williams as Xander Drax. Williams' plays Drax with finesse as if he couldn't really decide whether he should be a ruthless man with no conscience or a man who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Not to say he acted bad but there were times where Drax acted more goofy than serious. There are a lot of neat parts that take place in this movie, much of which involves The Phantom. As a moviegoer, it's not often that a chase scene includes a horse. Horses were mans original car. Just listening to the hooves of the animal clop along the ground is much easier on the ears than always listening to the roar of a V8 engine. In addition to The Phantom's horse, Hero, he has a dog, named Devil. Devil, who has a very long tongue, is also a good animal actor. Both Hero, and Devil work together to help their master in the quest for justice. Even cooler is that they can communicate to each other! And that's not all, The Phantom works with other animals too and they're just as loyal. As stated before, he's just a well-educated "George of the Jungle". The music was to fun to listen to as well. David Newman provided the soundtrack and it's great how The Phantom was able to get its own theme. I say this because there have been other films in the past that have great ideas but weren't executed right partially due to the franchise not even having a musical theme. Besides what viewers see, how else would they remember a film? By something they listen too obviously! Look at Stars Wars. No one even has to say what it is just by listening to the main theme. Lastly, the action was good too. It is very much enjoyable to see Billy Zane, Swanson and Zeta-Jones swinging swords and firing pistols at various opponents. However, some of these action sequences seemed slowed a little bit too much and too often. There were times where I was waiting for a move to end but it was moving ever so slowly that I thought it would never finish. Also the finale between The Phantom and Drax was weak. I was expecting something a little more than what I saw. But these flaws are so minor that it won't really bother the audience. Although it is not the first comic book adaptation to hit the theaters, it is an adaptation of the first comic book hero and it is done fairly well. There are some parts that may seem out of place, but overall it is a decent adventure film.

    The Phantom (Billy Zane), descendant of a line of African heroes, travels to New York to thwart a criminal genius (Treat Williams). A great cast, lead by Billy Zane, with Joe Dante producing (and almost directing). Could Bruce Campbell in the lead have made this film better? Hard to say. (I love Zane, but I have to admit he mumbles quite a bit through this film.) What I find most striking about this movie is that it has received a terrible reputation on IMDb (ranking below 5 of 10 stars), but managed to pull a 3.5 of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. Wow. Has Ebert ever been more off the mark from the common viewer? I, for one, liked it and found it a visually appealing adventure film. I especially appreciate the setting of 1930s New York, a wonderful backdrop for a crime story. I must confess I never read the comic strip, so the accuracy is something I cannot attest to. But I would have gladly welcomed a sequel, rather than have Zane go on to make "Titanic".

    This is a fun and well-made escapist film that would have, in a better world, performed much better at the box office. I blame the poor BO for The Phantom on several factors: 1) The character has limited to poor visibility in the USA, as opposed to other superheroes 2) 'Batman Returns' and 'Batman Forever,' which preceded this, were of mediocre to poor quality, thus making audiences unwilling to risk their money to see this film 3) Period pieces are a risky venture for film-makers seeking a young audience...the Rocketeer and The Shadow (both good films!) had failed to sell tickets prior to this film. This film is not intended to be the 'Citizen Kane' of superheroes and who really needs a Citzen Kane of superheroes anyway? Rather, we have an attempt to do a superhero in the style of an Indiana Jones movie, and this actually works quite well. The substance of this movie is largely good old-fashioned fight scenes, daring stunts (there's a great scene with Our Hero jumping from a flying biplane onto a running horse...great stuff!), cliffhangers, and exotic locales. There are a number of deviations from the Phantom comicstrip that might irk die-hard fans, but I have come to accept that there will always be liberties taken in these things...IMO, this adaptation retains enough of the spirit of the comics for the liberties to be forgiven. The only weak point of this film is, for me, the strange androgynous perfection of Billy Zane's face...perhaps this film was simply made at the worst moment of 1990's male aesthetic, but when Zane is not wearing his Phantom mask, he looks too much like a male prostitute for my tastes. However, when he wears the Phantom mask, Zane does indeed look, sound and act like Our Hero, so overall I was able to enjoy the film quite a lot. Other performance were completely enjoyable, especially Treat Williams as the villain and a young smoking-hot Catherine Zeta Jones as a dangerous lady pilot. Best among the supporting cast was the always great Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the Phantom's father...this character never appeared in the comics but if my own father were to come back as a ghost I'd like Patrick McGoohan to play him! (This is somewhat poignant to write this, McGoohan being dead for a few years now, him obviously being a ghost himself....) I especially appreciate this film now, since superhero films are now dominated by over-top-sadism and ultraviolence, or by confusing messes of phantasmogorical cosmic spectacle where you can't tell what the heck is happening. This film is old-fashioned fun and escapism, and if that is what you seek, you will be happy with The Phantom.

    Only read a comic book once or twice on the Phantom. So I had no preconceived notions. I give this 7 out of 10, because it was enjoyable, and I think it executed it's ideas well (it's an homage to serials I believe, like Indiana Jones.) I liked the guy who played the Phantom, he had an amusing charisma of sorts. The girl who played Diana was cute, and I enjoyed her independent woman role. Sure it's simplistic, but that's the style you go after for this genre. It's about heros and damsels in distress so to speak. The female villainess was probably the best role. She was sexy and fun.

    OK, first of all I have to state that I've never read the Phantom before - this movie introduced me to that character. So, if this movie doesn't somehow "stick" to Lee Falk's Phantom comics, I apologize. However, as movies go, this movie is written and is filmed like a movie from the time period it tried to mimic - the late 1930's/1940's. It has a great storyline and fantastic characters. It's one of the few movies that my kids and I can watch over and over again - it's just that good. I'm not sure why this movie has such a so-so review rating. In any event, give it a try and enjoy. It has everything a good movie needs - a realistic and believable hero, a great story-line and overall objective. A fantastic protagonist who is always trying to thwart our here, the Phantom. Plus, a movie that covers New York and the Jungles of Northeaster India. It's just a fantastic adventure movie.

    The plane crashes into a cliff and explodes in a great ball of fire. The only problem is that the reason it crashes is because it has run out of fuel. So what caused the fire? This about sums up the movie. There has to be some credibility in even fantasy movies such as this. The Phantom is an eerie, brooding and pitiless character who has such strange and dreadful powers that he is literally a supernatural being and one who is essentially so unearthly that mere human beings would be transfixed with terror in his presence. Yet in this movie he comes across as being a bit of a numbskull - the lights are on but there is no one home.

    I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed. The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drops charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team. Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a much for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever "humor" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. (That was one area where I thought the X-Men movies failed. Nothing memorable at all in the score ... they should have used the theme from the cartoon show. LOL) The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels. We also enjoyed the Phantom serial from the OLD movie days. Of course its campy but its fun and a lot of hours of entertainment for the price:
