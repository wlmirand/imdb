 <sinopse>
  Reunited by the death of a college friend, three divorced women seek revenge on the husbands who left them for younger women.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  After years of helping their hubbies climb the ladder of success, three wives have been dumped for newer, curvier models. But the trio is determined to turn their pain into gain. They come up with a cleverly devious plan to hit their exes where it really hurts - in the wallet! Sit back and watch the sparks fly as The Wives get mad, get even and get it all. Justice has seldom been so sweet. Or so much fun.

    This movie has no depth, no meaning and no direction... I would have expected more than below average from these actresses. It just looks like these fading actresses have paid someone to make this movie so that they can have some more time under the spotlight. The script is utterly disgusting and absolutely noting as far as acting is concerned. 1:42 mins of disappointment.... you wait for something average to turn up, although going by the way this movie goes, it does not look like there will be anything above average, still going by these actresses track records, you hope for them that something the movie will take a turn for the good.

    This movie works because it uses each of it's leads in the way that best suits them and makes them shine. Three excellent comedians at their best. It's funny even the second time for all the funny details. A real feel good movie when their ex husbands get their just desserts. Goldie Hawn is in a role she is best for doing a diva actress who isn't afraid of making fun of herself. Diane Keaton Bette Midler has a good showcase for her sharp humor. Even SJP pre Sex and the City is good as the second wife. The men are well cast too. Stephen Collins as a cheating spouse, a role he has played well several times before is just right. Nice cameos from Maggie Smith and Ivana Trump and Marcia Gay Harden.

    Well, this was an entertaining movie, but it did not really stand out. The movie started off slowly and seemed to end in a whimper. The main characters came out on top, and the men that they were trying to manipulate were successfully manipulated. This is not an original movie as I had seen it all before in She-Devil. The only difference was that it dealt with three women instead of one. The basic premise is that four women graduated from college together full of idealism. Later in life their idealism is destroyed as their respective husbands walk out on them - and each of them handle it in a different way. One destroys herself with alcohol, another constantly complains and tries to hang onto her son, while another remains oblivious to the fact that anything is wrong. The forth one throws herself off of a building and it is this event that draws them all back together. They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life, and this has been discarded by them, so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them. Basically it becomes a similar plot to that of She-Devil. There is nothing that really stands out in this movie that I really wish to discuss. It looks at the frustration that women face in divorce, and though this may be a rare case, women can be just as vicious in divorce proceedings as can men. If we look at Liar Liar, we see a woman milking the man for all that she can get - while here the men have used the women and thrown them away. I agree that men can be bastards, but so can everybody. I guess the purpose of this movie was to try and bring us into the women's point of view - but the theme can be gender-neutral, with the exception that men (or men that I have known) will simply wallow in their misery, while women will carry on. Even then that statement is not entirely true as everybody reacts to a divorce situation differently. I was going to make a comment that it was based on a book written by a female, while the screenwriters and directors were male, meaning that the female psyche is not portrayed as well as say a film by Amy Heckerling. But this film does no such thing and is really a movie about people being thrown away and then climbing back up to the top. In conclusion, I will say that this is not an outstanding or impressive movie, and though entertaining after the first few minutes, it is nothing that I will really talk about that much.

    If you watch "The First Wives Club" because you need a good laugh, perhaps you should try another film. Yes, it clearly has some funny moments but it also is filled with dark ones--and a message you wouldn't expect to find in a simple comedy. You KNOW it's going to be a dark film at the beginning, as a lady whose husband has left her takes her own life. This horrible event brings some of her old friends to the funeral--and there they compare notes and see that they, too, were used and cast aside by their husbands--husbands who have no replaced them with trophy wives. So, the three friends (Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn) concoct a plan--a plan that involves fleecing their unfaithful ex-husbands and creating a club for wives going through the same sort of situations they have. As I said, there are some dark moments and some funny ones. But the film never falls to the level of slapstick or becomes mostly comedy--but a mix. Some may not like this and the film is a bit heavy-handed at times, but the overall film is well worth seeing and has a decent feminist message. Worth seeing.

    I just finished watching The First Wives Club on HBO for the hundredth time. I absolutely love the movie. I love the team work. It's so nice to have a movie where the women are not jealous of each other and trying to bring each other down. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. As a child of divorce who watched her father move on to another woman and leave his family to flounder while he prospered, I totally understand the need of the women to make their husbands understand the damage they've done. The First Wives Club is a feel good movie that entertains and motivates you to rise above your problems to do good for others.

    This film is, I think, more one for the sisterhood than anyone else. I don't mean that in any derogatory sense, but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mish-mash, redeemed, in part, by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler, as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant, and Goldie Hawn, an ageing Oscar-winning film start, who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton (who is never my favourite actress, I'm sorry to say) as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group, the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street money-man, who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day, but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral, they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up', with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton, still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated, obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another, and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important: it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books: they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels (and even works of non-fiction). And there have been great films based on very poor material (and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor). In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel, this is no great shakes, though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems  great scenes, great acting and great one-liners  from Midler and Hawn. But overall, as I suggest, this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' (yes, I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind, although one pronounced in such a half-hearted fashion, I do wonder why they even bothered), the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is, as I suspect it was intended to be, some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to, of course, and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother: what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me. The inclusion of Maggie Smith as the queen bee of New York society (with a very dodgy American accent even to my Brit ears) seems more like an attempt to attract the punters and gain a little spurious 'class' for the film. She plays hardly any part in the film, except as a cackhanded plot device, and even that might have been achieved with a small re-write. Me, I'll remember the good bits involving Midler and Hawn, but I wouldn't have been heartbroken had I fished another &pound;3 DVD out of my supermarket bargain bin rather than this one and never seen it.

    I never read the book, but my husband did, and he said the women in the movie were kinder than they were in the book... which I find hard to believe! These 3 women find themselves middle aged and in the middle of huge life changes, all brought about by the desertions and betrayals of the men they'd devoted their younger years to. They all sort of fall apart, but pull themselves together through friendship - and a new-found purpose. Their new purpose in life? To destroy the men who betrayed them. It's a very funny movie, not surprising, considering the all-star cast. They do an admirable job, not only of exacting revenge, but of rediscovering their friendships, and discovering exactly how strong they really are. I really enjoyed this movie, and so did my husband.

    I really like this film. Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Stockard Channing have been friends for years and all have something in common - cheating, flaky husbands. So far, so clich&eacute;. But the 'First Wives Club' is an inspired bit of fluff, fun, perceptive, and full of high spirits. These forty-something ladies replaced by younger models aren't going to take their fate lying down, and what a hoot it is watching them set up their outfit to take fickle men to the cleaners. OK, the film is a little sexist, with a one-dimensional view of both men and women; but it succeeds as entertainment. Some of the supporting caricatures are simply hideous, but work well. You can also spot stars of the future such as Sarah Jessica Parker in smaller roles. If you take this film for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it. It's one of those films that you'll either love or hate - but with this calibre of cast it's worth a look.

    A goofy comedy designed as a star vehicle for its three leading ladies, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler. Is it a good movie? Not really. But does that matter? Not really. It mostly succeeds based on the sheer talent of the three actresses involved, who could probably make a movie about the invention of barbed wire funny if they had to. I don't know that this movie presents a very flattering image of middle-aged women, but since middle-aged women seem to be the ones who most love this film, if they don't mind, why should I? Grade: B

    That's it.You'll thank me later for saving you the cost of renting this truly appalling movie starring three women who all know men better than to really believe this pseudo - feminist horse puckie. And it's not even true to its outrageous premise because they all take their exes back in the end.... And its got Maggie Smith in it.My cup runneth over. Miss Midler is very loud and Jewish,Miss Hawn scatty and blond,Miss Keaton fragile and WASP.How daring is that? There is a scene on a window cleaner's hoist that is so long and unfunny I was holding my head in my hands by the end of it. Does Miss Midler get to sing "The wind beneath my wings"?You'll have to watch it to find out,but if you're rather hoping she does then "The first Wives' club" may well be right up your street.

And it's not even true to its outrageous premise because they all take their exes back in the end.... And its got Maggie Smith in it.My cup runneth over. Miss Midler is very loud and Jewish,Miss Hawn scatty and blond,Miss Keaton fragile and WASP.How daring is that? There is a scene on a window cleaner's hoist that is so long and unfunny I was holding my head in my hands by the end of it. Does Miss Midler get to sing "The wind beneath my wings"?You'll have to watch it to find out,but if you're rather hoping she does then "The first Wives' club" may well be right up your street.

    This movie has no depth, no meaning and no direction... I would have expected more than below average from these actresses. It just looks like these fading actresses have paid someone to make this movie so that they can have some more time under the spotlight. The script is utterly disgusting and absolutely noting as far as acting is concerned. 1:42 mins of disappointment.... you wait for something average to turn up, although going by the way this movie goes, it does not look like there will be anything above average, still going by these actresses track records, you hope for them that something the movie will take a turn for the good.

    This movie works because it uses each of it's leads in the way that best suits them and makes them shine. Three excellent comedians at their best. It's funny even the second time for all the funny details. A real feel good movie when their ex husbands get their just desserts. Goldie Hawn is in a role she is best for doing a diva actress who isn't afraid of making fun of herself. Diane Keaton Bette Midler has a good showcase for her sharp humor. Even SJP pre Sex and the City is good as the second wife. The men are well cast too. Stephen Collins as a cheating spouse, a role he has played well several times before is just right. Nice cameos from Maggie Smith and Ivana Trump and Marcia Gay Harden.

    Well, this was an entertaining movie, but it did not really stand out. The movie started off slowly and seemed to end in a whimper. The main characters came out on top, and the men that they were trying to manipulate were successfully manipulated. This is not an original movie as I had seen it all before in She-Devil. The only difference was that it dealt with three women instead of one. The basic premise is that four women graduated from college together full of idealism. Later in life their idealism is destroyed as their respective husbands walk out on them - and each of them handle it in a different way. One destroys herself with alcohol, another constantly complains and tries to hang onto her son, while another remains oblivious to the fact that anything is wrong. The forth one throws herself off of a building and it is this event that draws them all back together. They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life, and this has been discarded by them, so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them. Basically it becomes a similar plot to that of She-Devil. There is nothing that really stands out in this movie that I really wish to discuss. It looks at the frustration that women face in divorce, and though this may be a rare case, women can be just as vicious in divorce proceedings as can men. If we look at Liar Liar, we see a woman milking the man for all that she can get - while here the men have used the women and thrown them away. I agree that men can be bastards, but so can everybody. I guess the purpose of this movie was to try and bring us into the women's point of view - but the theme can be gender-neutral, with the exception that men (or men that I have known) will simply wallow in their misery, while women will carry on. Even then that statement is not entirely true as everybody reacts to a divorce situation differently. I was going to make a comment that it was based on a book written by a female, while the screenwriters and directors were male, meaning that the female psyche is not portrayed as well as say a film by Amy Heckerling. But this film does no such thing and is really a movie about people being thrown away and then climbing back up to the top. In conclusion, I will say that this is not an outstanding or impressive movie, and though entertaining after the first few minutes, it is nothing that I will really talk about that much.

    If you watch "The First Wives Club" because you need a good laugh, perhaps you should try another film. Yes, it clearly has some funny moments but it also is filled with dark ones--and a message you wouldn't expect to find in a simple comedy. You KNOW it's going to be a dark film at the beginning, as a lady whose husband has left her takes her own life. This horrible event brings some of her old friends to the funeral--and there they compare notes and see that they, too, were used and cast aside by their husbands--husbands who have no replaced them with trophy wives. So, the three friends (Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn) concoct a plan--a plan that involves fleecing their unfaithful ex-husbands and creating a club for wives going through the same sort of situations they have. As I said, there are some dark moments and some funny ones. But the film never falls to the level of slapstick or becomes mostly comedy--but a mix. Some may not like this and the film is a bit heavy-handed at times, but the overall film is well worth seeing and has a decent feminist message. Worth seeing.

    I just finished watching The First Wives Club on HBO for the hundredth time. I absolutely love the movie. I love the team work. It's so nice to have a movie where the women are not jealous of each other and trying to bring each other down. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. As a child of divorce who watched her father move on to another woman and leave his family to flounder while he prospered, I totally understand the need of the women to make their husbands understand the damage they've done. The First Wives Club is a feel good movie that entertains and motivates you to rise above your problems to do good for others.

    This film is, I think, more one for the sisterhood than anyone else. I don't mean that in any derogatory sense, but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mish-mash, redeemed, in part, by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler, as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant, and Goldie Hawn, an ageing Oscar-winning film start, who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton (who is never my favourite actress, I'm sorry to say) as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group, the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street money-man, who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day, but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral, they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up', with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton, still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated, obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another, and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important: it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books: they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels (and even works of non-fiction). And there have been great films based on very poor material (and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor). In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel, this is no great shakes, though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems  great scenes, great acting and great one-liners  from Midler and Hawn. But overall, as I suggest, this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' (yes, I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind, although one pronounced in such a half-hearted fashion, I do wonder why they even bothered), the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is, as I suspect it was intended to be, some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to, of course, and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother: what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me. The inclusion of Maggie Smith as the queen bee of New York society (with a very dodgy American accent even to my Brit ears) seems more like an attempt to attract the punters and gain a little spurious 'class' for the film. She plays hardly any part in the film, except as a cackhanded plot device, and even that might have been achieved with a small re-write. Me, I'll remember the good bits involving Midler and Hawn, but I wouldn't have been heartbroken had I fished another &pound;3 DVD out of my supermarket bargain bin rather than this one and never seen it.

    I never read the book, but my husband did, and he said the women in the movie were kinder than they were in the book... which I find hard to believe! These 3 women find themselves middle aged and in the middle of huge life changes, all brought about by the desertions and betrayals of the men they'd devoted their younger years to. They all sort of fall apart, but pull themselves together through friendship - and a new-found purpose. Their new purpose in life? To destroy the men who betrayed them. It's a very funny movie, not surprising, considering the all-star cast. They do an admirable job, not only of exacting revenge, but of rediscovering their friendships, and discovering exactly how strong they really are. I really enjoyed this movie, and so did my husband.

    I really like this film. Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Stockard Channing have been friends for years and all have something in common - cheating, flaky husbands. So far, so clich&eacute;. But the 'First Wives Club' is an inspired bit of fluff, fun, perceptive, and full of high spirits. These forty-something ladies replaced by younger models aren't going to take their fate lying down, and what a hoot it is watching them set up their outfit to take fickle men to the cleaners. OK, the film is a little sexist, with a one-dimensional view of both men and women; but it succeeds as entertainment. Some of the supporting caricatures are simply hideous, but work well. You can also spot stars of the future such as Sarah Jessica Parker in smaller roles. If you take this film for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it. It's one of those films that you'll either love or hate - but with this calibre of cast it's worth a look.

    A goofy comedy designed as a star vehicle for its three leading ladies, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler. Is it a good movie? Not really. But does that matter? Not really. It mostly succeeds based on the sheer talent of the three actresses involved, who could probably make a movie about the invention of barbed wire funny if they had to. I don't know that this movie presents a very flattering image of middle-aged women, but since middle-aged women seem to be the ones who most love this film, if they don't mind, why should I? Grade: B

The script is utterly disgusting and absolutely noting as far as acting is concerned. 1:42 mins of disappointment.... you wait for something average to turn up, although going by the way this movie goes, it does not look like there will be anything above average, still going by these actresses track records, you hope for them that something the movie will take a turn for the good.

    This movie works because it uses each of it's leads in the way that best suits them and makes them shine. Three excellent comedians at their best. It's funny even the second time for all the funny details. A real feel good movie when their ex husbands get their just desserts. Goldie Hawn is in a role she is best for doing a diva actress who isn't afraid of making fun of herself. Diane Keaton Bette Midler has a good showcase for her sharp humor. Even SJP pre Sex and the City is good as the second wife. The men are well cast too. Stephen Collins as a cheating spouse, a role he has played well several times before is just right. Nice cameos from Maggie Smith and Ivana Trump and Marcia Gay Harden.

    Well, this was an entertaining movie, but it did not really stand out. The movie started off slowly and seemed to end in a whimper. The main characters came out on top, and the men that they were trying to manipulate were successfully manipulated. This is not an original movie as I had seen it all before in She-Devil. The only difference was that it dealt with three women instead of one. The basic premise is that four women graduated from college together full of idealism. Later in life their idealism is destroyed as their respective husbands walk out on them - and each of them handle it in a different way. One destroys herself with alcohol, another constantly complains and tries to hang onto her son, while another remains oblivious to the fact that anything is wrong. The forth one throws herself off of a building and it is this event that draws them all back together. They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life, and this has been discarded by them, so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them. Basically it becomes a similar plot to that of She-Devil. There is nothing that really stands out in this movie that I really wish to discuss. It looks at the frustration that women face in divorce, and though this may be a rare case, women can be just as vicious in divorce proceedings as can men. If we look at Liar Liar, we see a woman milking the man for all that she can get - while here the men have used the women and thrown them away. I agree that men can be bastards, but so can everybody. I guess the purpose of this movie was to try and bring us into the women's point of view - but the theme can be gender-neutral, with the exception that men (or men that I have known) will simply wallow in their misery, while women will carry on. Even then that statement is not entirely true as everybody reacts to a divorce situation differently. I was going to make a comment that it was based on a book written by a female, while the screenwriters and directors were male, meaning that the female psyche is not portrayed as well as say a film by Amy Heckerling. But this film does no such thing and is really a movie about people being thrown away and then climbing back up to the top. In conclusion, I will say that this is not an outstanding or impressive movie, and though entertaining after the first few minutes, it is nothing that I will really talk about that much.

    If you watch "The First Wives Club" because you need a good laugh, perhaps you should try another film. Yes, it clearly has some funny moments but it also is filled with dark ones--and a message you wouldn't expect to find in a simple comedy. You KNOW it's going to be a dark film at the beginning, as a lady whose husband has left her takes her own life. This horrible event brings some of her old friends to the funeral--and there they compare notes and see that they, too, were used and cast aside by their husbands--husbands who have no replaced them with trophy wives. So, the three friends (Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn) concoct a plan--a plan that involves fleecing their unfaithful ex-husbands and creating a club for wives going through the same sort of situations they have. As I said, there are some dark moments and some funny ones. But the film never falls to the level of slapstick or becomes mostly comedy--but a mix. Some may not like this and the film is a bit heavy-handed at times, but the overall film is well worth seeing and has a decent feminist message. Worth seeing.

    I just finished watching The First Wives Club on HBO for the hundredth time. I absolutely love the movie. I love the team work. It's so nice to have a movie where the women are not jealous of each other and trying to bring each other down. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. As a child of divorce who watched her father move on to another woman and leave his family to flounder while he prospered, I totally understand the need of the women to make their husbands understand the damage they've done. The First Wives Club is a feel good movie that entertains and motivates you to rise above your problems to do good for others.

    This film is, I think, more one for the sisterhood than anyone else. I don't mean that in any derogatory sense, but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mish-mash, redeemed, in part, by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler, as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant, and Goldie Hawn, an ageing Oscar-winning film start, who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton (who is never my favourite actress, I'm sorry to say) as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group, the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street money-man, who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day, but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral, they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up', with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton, still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated, obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another, and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important: it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books: they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels (and even works of non-fiction). And there have been great films based on very poor material (and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor). In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel, this is no great shakes, though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems  great scenes, great acting and great one-liners  from Midler and Hawn. But overall, as I suggest, this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' (yes, I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind, although one pronounced in such a half-hearted fashion, I do wonder why they even bothered), the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is, as I suspect it was intended to be, some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to, of course, and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother: what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me. The inclusion of Maggie Smith as the queen bee of New York society (with a very dodgy American accent even to my Brit ears) seems more like an attempt to attract the punters and gain a little spurious 'class' for the film. She plays hardly any part in the film, except as a cackhanded plot device, and even that might have been achieved with a small re-write. Me, I'll remember the good bits involving Midler and Hawn, but I wouldn't have been heartbroken had I fished another &pound;3 DVD out of my supermarket bargain bin rather than this one and never seen it.

    I never read the book, but my husband did, and he said the women in the movie were kinder than they were in the book... which I find hard to believe! These 3 women find themselves middle aged and in the middle of huge life changes, all brought about by the desertions and betrayals of the men they'd devoted their younger years to. They all sort of fall apart, but pull themselves together through friendship - and a new-found purpose. Their new purpose in life? To destroy the men who betrayed them. It's a very funny movie, not surprising, considering the all-star cast. They do an admirable job, not only of exacting revenge, but of rediscovering their friendships, and discovering exactly how strong they really are. I really enjoyed this movie, and so did my husband.

    I really like this film. Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Stockard Channing have been friends for years and all have something in common - cheating, flaky husbands. So far, so clich&eacute;. But the 'First Wives Club' is an inspired bit of fluff, fun, perceptive, and full of high spirits. These forty-something ladies replaced by younger models aren't going to take their fate lying down, and what a hoot it is watching them set up their outfit to take fickle men to the cleaners. OK, the film is a little sexist, with a one-dimensional view of both men and women; but it succeeds as entertainment. Some of the supporting caricatures are simply hideous, but work well. You can also spot stars of the future such as Sarah Jessica Parker in smaller roles. If you take this film for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it. It's one of those films that you'll either love or hate - but with this calibre of cast it's worth a look.

    A goofy comedy designed as a star vehicle for its three leading ladies, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler. Is it a good movie? Not really. But does that matter? Not really. It mostly succeeds based on the sheer talent of the three actresses involved, who could probably make a movie about the invention of barbed wire funny if they had to. I don't know that this movie presents a very flattering image of middle-aged women, but since middle-aged women seem to be the ones who most love this film, if they don't mind, why should I? Grade: B

And it's not even true to its outrageous premise because they all take their exes back in the end.... And its got Maggie Smith in it.My cup runneth over. Miss Midler is very loud and Jewish,Miss Hawn scatty and blond,Miss Keaton fragile and WASP.How daring is that? There is a scene on a window cleaner's hoist that is so long and unfunny I was holding my head in my hands by the end of it. Does Miss Midler get to sing "The wind beneath my wings"?You'll have to watch it to find out,but if you're rather hoping she does then "The first Wives' club" may well be right up your street.

Nice cameos from Maggie Smith and Ivana Trump and Marcia Gay Harden.

    Well, this was an entertaining movie, but it did not really stand out. The movie started off slowly and seemed to end in a whimper. The main characters came out on top, and the men that they were trying to manipulate were successfully manipulated. This is not an original movie as I had seen it all before in She-Devil. The only difference was that it dealt with three women instead of one. The basic premise is that four women graduated from college together full of idealism. Later in life their idealism is destroyed as their respective husbands walk out on them - and each of them handle it in a different way. One destroys herself with alcohol, another constantly complains and tries to hang onto her son, while another remains oblivious to the fact that anything is wrong. The forth one throws herself off of a building and it is this event that draws them all back together. They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life, and this has been discarded by them, so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them. Basically it becomes a similar plot to that of She-Devil. There is nothing that really stands out in this movie that I really wish to discuss. It looks at the frustration that women face in divorce, and though this may be a rare case, women can be just as vicious in divorce proceedings as can men. If we look at Liar Liar, we see a woman milking the man for all that she can get - while here the men have used the women and thrown them away. I agree that men can be bastards, but so can everybody. I guess the purpose of this movie was to try and bring us into the women's point of view - but the theme can be gender-neutral, with the exception that men (or men that I have known) will simply wallow in their misery, while women will carry on. Even then that statement is not entirely true as everybody reacts to a divorce situation differently. I was going to make a comment that it was based on a book written by a female, while the screenwriters and directors were male, meaning that the female psyche is not portrayed as well as say a film by Amy Heckerling. But this film does no such thing and is really a movie about people being thrown away and then climbing back up to the top. In conclusion, I will say that this is not an outstanding or impressive movie, and though entertaining after the first few minutes, it is nothing that I will really talk about that much.

    If you watch "The First Wives Club" because you need a good laugh, perhaps you should try another film. Yes, it clearly has some funny moments but it also is filled with dark ones--and a message you wouldn't expect to find in a simple comedy. You KNOW it's going to be a dark film at the beginning, as a lady whose husband has left her takes her own life. This horrible event brings some of her old friends to the funeral--and there they compare notes and see that they, too, were used and cast aside by their husbands--husbands who have no replaced them with trophy wives. So, the three friends (Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn) concoct a plan--a plan that involves fleecing their unfaithful ex-husbands and creating a club for wives going through the same sort of situations they have. As I said, there are some dark moments and some funny ones. But the film never falls to the level of slapstick or becomes mostly comedy--but a mix. Some may not like this and the film is a bit heavy-handed at times, but the overall film is well worth seeing and has a decent feminist message. Worth seeing.

    I just finished watching The First Wives Club on HBO for the hundredth time. I absolutely love the movie. I love the team work. It's so nice to have a movie where the women are not jealous of each other and trying to bring each other down. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. As a child of divorce who watched her father move on to another woman and leave his family to flounder while he prospered, I totally understand the need of the women to make their husbands understand the damage they've done. The First Wives Club is a feel good movie that entertains and motivates you to rise above your problems to do good for others.

    This film is, I think, more one for the sisterhood than anyone else. I don't mean that in any derogatory sense, but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mish-mash, redeemed, in part, by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler, as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant, and Goldie Hawn, an ageing Oscar-winning film start, who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton (who is never my favourite actress, I'm sorry to say) as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group, the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street money-man, who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day, but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral, they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up', with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton, still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated, obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another, and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important: it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books: they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels (and even works of non-fiction). And there have been great films based on very poor material (and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor). In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel, this is no great shakes, though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems  great scenes, great acting and great one-liners  from Midler and Hawn. But overall, as I suggest, this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' (yes, I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind, although one pronounced in such a half-hearted fashion, I do wonder why they even bothered), the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is, as I suspect it was intended to be, some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to, of course, and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother: what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me. The inclusion of Maggie Smith as the queen bee of New York society (with a very dodgy American accent even to my Brit ears) seems more like an attempt to attract the punters and gain a little spurious 'class' for the film. She plays hardly any part in the film, except as a cackhanded plot device, and even that might have been achieved with a small re-write. Me, I'll remember the good bits involving Midler and Hawn, but I wouldn't have been heartbroken had I fished another &pound;3 DVD out of my supermarket bargain bin rather than this one and never seen it.

    I never read the book, but my husband did, and he said the women in the movie were kinder than they were in the book... which I find hard to believe! These 3 women find themselves middle aged and in the middle of huge life changes, all brought about by the desertions and betrayals of the men they'd devoted their younger years to. They all sort of fall apart, but pull themselves together through friendship - and a new-found purpose. Their new purpose in life? To destroy the men who betrayed them. It's a very funny movie, not surprising, considering the all-star cast. They do an admirable job, not only of exacting revenge, but of rediscovering their friendships, and discovering exactly how strong they really are. I really enjoyed this movie, and so did my husband.

    I really like this film. Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Stockard Channing have been friends for years and all have something in common - cheating, flaky husbands. So far, so clich&eacute;. But the 'First Wives Club' is an inspired bit of fluff, fun, perceptive, and full of high spirits. These forty-something ladies replaced by younger models aren't going to take their fate lying down, and what a hoot it is watching them set up their outfit to take fickle men to the cleaners. OK, the film is a little sexist, with a one-dimensional view of both men and women; but it succeeds as entertainment. Some of the supporting caricatures are simply hideous, but work well. You can also spot stars of the future such as Sarah Jessica Parker in smaller roles. If you take this film for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it. It's one of those films that you'll either love or hate - but with this calibre of cast it's worth a look.

    A goofy comedy designed as a star vehicle for its three leading ladies, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler. Is it a good movie? Not really. But does that matter? Not really. It mostly succeeds based on the sheer talent of the three actresses involved, who could probably make a movie about the invention of barbed wire funny if they had to. I don't know that this movie presents a very flattering image of middle-aged women, but since middle-aged women seem to be the ones who most love this film, if they don't mind, why should I? Grade: B

And it's not even true to its outrageous premise because they all take their exes back in the end.... And its got Maggie Smith in it.My cup runneth over. Miss Midler is very loud and Jewish,Miss Hawn scatty and blond,Miss Keaton fragile and WASP.How daring is that? There is a scene on a window cleaner's hoist that is so long and unfunny I was holding my head in my hands by the end of it. Does Miss Midler get to sing "The wind beneath my wings"?You'll have to watch it to find out,but if you're rather hoping she does then "The first Wives' club" may well be right up your street.

    This movie has no depth, no meaning and no direction... I would have expected more than below average from these actresses. It just looks like these fading actresses have paid someone to make this movie so that they can have some more time under the spotlight. The script is utterly disgusting and absolutely noting as far as acting is concerned. 1:42 mins of disappointment.... you wait for something average to turn up, although going by the way this movie goes, it does not look like there will be anything above average, still going by these actresses track records, you hope for them that something the movie will take a turn for the good.

    This movie works because it uses each of it's leads in the way that best suits them and makes them shine. Three excellent comedians at their best. It's funny even the second time for all the funny details. A real feel good movie when their ex husbands get their just desserts. Goldie Hawn is in a role she is best for doing a diva actress who isn't afraid of making fun of herself. Diane Keaton Bette Midler has a good showcase for her sharp humor. Even SJP pre Sex and the City is good as the second wife. The men are well cast too. Stephen Collins as a cheating spouse, a role he has played well several times before is just right.

They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life, and this has been discarded by them, so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them. Basically it becomes a similar plot to that of She-Devil. There is nothing that really stands out in this movie that I really wish to discuss. It looks at the frustration that women face in divorce, and though this may be a rare case, women can be just as vicious in divorce proceedings as can men. If we look at Liar Liar, we see a woman milking the man for all that she can get - while here the men have used the women and thrown them away. I agree that men can be bastards, but so can everybody. I guess the purpose of this movie was to try and bring us into the women's point of view - but the theme can be gender-neutral, with the exception that men (or men that I have known) will simply wallow in their misery, while women will carry on. Even then that statement is not entirely true as everybody reacts to a divorce situation differently. I was going to make a comment that it was based on a book written by a female, while the screenwriters and directors were male, meaning that the female psyche is not portrayed as well as say a film by Amy Heckerling. But this film does no such thing and is really a movie about people being thrown away and then climbing back up to the top. In conclusion, I will say that this is not an outstanding or impressive movie, and though entertaining after the first few minutes, it is nothing that I will really talk about that much.

    If you watch "The First Wives Club" because you need a good laugh, perhaps you should try another film. Yes, it clearly has some funny moments but it also is filled with dark ones--and a message you wouldn't expect to find in a simple comedy. You KNOW it's going to be a dark film at the beginning, as a lady whose husband has left her takes her own life. This horrible event brings some of her old friends to the funeral--and there they compare notes and see that they, too, were used and cast aside by their husbands--husbands who have no replaced them with trophy wives. So, the three friends (Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn) concoct a plan--a plan that involves fleecing their unfaithful ex-husbands and creating a club for wives going through the same sort of situations they have. As I said, there are some dark moments and some funny ones. But the film never falls to the level of slapstick or becomes mostly comedy--but a mix. Some may not like this and the film is a bit heavy-handed at times, but the overall film is well worth seeing and has a decent feminist message. Worth seeing.

    I just finished watching The First Wives Club on HBO for the hundredth time. I absolutely love the movie. I love the team work. It's so nice to have a movie where the women are not jealous of each other and trying to bring each other down. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. As a child of divorce who watched her father move on to another woman and leave his family to flounder while he prospered, I totally understand the need of the women to make their husbands understand the damage they've done. The First Wives Club is a feel good movie that entertains and motivates you to rise above your problems to do good for others.

    This film is, I think, more one for the sisterhood than anyone else. I don't mean that in any derogatory sense, but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mish-mash, redeemed, in part, by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler, as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant, and Goldie Hawn, an ageing Oscar-winning film start, who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton (who is never my favourite actress, I'm sorry to say) as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group, the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street money-man, who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day, but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral, they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up', with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton, still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated, obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another, and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important: it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books: they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels (and even works of non-fiction). And there have been great films based on very poor material (and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor). In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel, this is no great shakes, though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems  great scenes, great acting and great one-liners  from Midler and Hawn. But overall, as I suggest, this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' (yes, I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind, although one pronounced in such a half-hearted fashion, I do wonder why they even bothered), the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is, as I suspect it was intended to be, some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to, of course, and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother: what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me. The inclusion of Maggie Smith as the queen bee of New York society (with a very dodgy American accent even to my Brit ears) seems more like an attempt to attract the punters and gain a little spurious 'class' for the film. She plays hardly any part in the film, except as a cackhanded plot device, and even that might have been achieved with a small re-write. Me, I'll remember the good bits involving Midler and Hawn, but I wouldn't have been heartbroken had I fished another &pound;3 DVD out of my supermarket bargain bin rather than this one and never seen it.

    I never read the book, but my husband did, and he said the women in the movie were kinder than they were in the book... which I find hard to believe! These 3 women find themselves middle aged and in the middle of huge life changes, all brought about by the desertions and betrayals of the men they'd devoted their younger years to. They all sort of fall apart, but pull themselves together through friendship - and a new-found purpose. Their new purpose in life? To destroy the men who betrayed them. It's a very funny movie, not surprising, considering the all-star cast. They do an admirable job, not only of exacting revenge, but of rediscovering their friendships, and discovering exactly how strong they really are. I really enjoyed this movie, and so did my husband.

    I really like this film. Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Stockard Channing have been friends for years and all have something in common - cheating, flaky husbands. So far, so clich&eacute;. But the 'First Wives Club' is an inspired bit of fluff, fun, perceptive, and full of high spirits. These forty-something ladies replaced by younger models aren't going to take their fate lying down, and what a hoot it is watching them set up their outfit to take fickle men to the cleaners. OK, the film is a little sexist, with a one-dimensional view of both men and women; but it succeeds as entertainment. Some of the supporting caricatures are simply hideous, but work well. You can also spot stars of the future such as Sarah Jessica Parker in smaller roles. If you take this film for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it. It's one of those films that you'll either love or hate - but with this calibre of cast it's worth a look.

    A goofy comedy designed as a star vehicle for its three leading ladies, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler. Is it a good movie? Not really. But does that matter? Not really. It mostly succeeds based on the sheer talent of the three actresses involved, who could probably make a movie about the invention of barbed wire funny if they had to. I don't know that this movie presents a very flattering image of middle-aged women, but since middle-aged women seem to be the ones who most love this film, if they don't mind, why should I? Grade: B

And it's not even true to its outrageous premise because they all take their exes back in the end.... And its got Maggie Smith in it.My cup runneth over. Miss Midler is very loud and Jewish,Miss Hawn scatty and blond,Miss Keaton fragile and WASP.How daring is that? There is a scene on a window cleaner's hoist that is so long and unfunny I was holding my head in my hands by the end of it. Does Miss Midler get to sing "The wind beneath my wings"?You'll have to watch it to find out,but if you're rather hoping she does then "The first Wives' club" may well be right up your street.

    This movie has no depth, no meaning and no direction... I would have expected more than below average from these actresses. It just looks like these fading actresses have paid someone to make this movie so that they can have some more time under the spotlight. The script is utterly disgusting and absolutely noting as far as acting is concerned. 1:42 mins of disappointment.... you wait for something average to turn up, although going by the way this movie goes, it does not look like there will be anything above average, still going by these actresses track records, you hope for them that something the movie will take a turn for the good.

    This movie works because it uses each of it's leads in the way that best suits them and makes them shine. Three excellent comedians at their best. It's funny even the second time for all the funny details. A real feel good movie when their ex husbands get their just desserts. Goldie Hawn is in a role she is best for doing a diva actress who isn't afraid of making fun of herself. Diane Keaton Bette Midler has a good showcase for her sharp humor. Even SJP pre Sex and the City is good as the second wife. The men are well cast too. Stephen Collins as a cheating spouse, a role he has played well several times before is just right. Nice cameos from Maggie Smith and Ivana Trump and Marcia Gay Harden.

    Well, this was an entertaining movie, but it did not really stand out. The movie started off slowly and seemed to end in a whimper. The main characters came out on top, and the men that they were trying to manipulate were successfully manipulated. This is not an original movie as I had seen it all before in She-Devil. The only difference was that it dealt with three women instead of one. The basic premise is that four women graduated from college together full of idealism. Later in life their idealism is destroyed as their respective husbands walk out on them - and each of them handle it in a different way. One destroys herself with alcohol, another constantly complains and tries to hang onto her son, while another remains oblivious to the fact that anything is wrong. The forth one throws herself off of a building and it is this event that draws them all back together. They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life, and this has been discarded by them, so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them.
