    John Carpenter, fresh of his triumphant turn as director of "Halloween" directs and writes this atmospheric, chilling(though at times violent) ghost story of vengeful spirits from a sunken ship coming to ruin the centenary celebrations of Antonio Bay, a coastal community with a terrible secret that a priest,(nicely played by Hal Holbrook) uncovers on a foggy April morning at the turn of midnight. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman round out a fine cast that help bring this underrated film to life, which also has an effective music score, and a whopping good ending. Was recently re-released on DVD by Shout/Scream factory in an excellent Special Edition that really brings out the texture of the widescreen(don't see this pan & scan!)

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

    I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin. It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified. The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death. "The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

    One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog. Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past. At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood. The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clich&eacute;d guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook. But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing. The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies. THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers. The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie. The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension. And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween. This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word... There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing. It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course. I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film. It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.

    I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance.

Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

    One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog. Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past. At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood. The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clich&eacute;d guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook. But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing. The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies. THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers. The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie. The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension. And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween. This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word... There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing. It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course. I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film. It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.

    I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.

    John Carpenter, fresh of his triumphant turn as director of "Halloween" directs and writes this atmospheric, chilling(though at times violent) ghost story of vengeful spirits from a sunken ship coming to ruin the centenary celebrations of Antonio Bay, a coastal community with a terrible secret that a priest,(nicely played by Hal Holbrook) uncovers on a foggy April morning at the turn of midnight. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman round out a fine cast that help bring this underrated film to life, which also has an effective music score, and a whopping good ending. Was recently re-released on DVD by Shout/Scream factory in an excellent Special Edition that really brings out the texture of the widescreen(don't see this pan & scan!)

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

    I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin. It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified. The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death. "The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies. THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers. The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie. The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension. And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween. This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word... There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing. It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course. I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film. It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.

    I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.

    John Carpenter, fresh of his triumphant turn as director of "Halloween" directs and writes this atmospheric, chilling(though at times violent) ghost story of vengeful spirits from a sunken ship coming to ruin the centenary celebrations of Antonio Bay, a coastal community with a terrible secret that a priest,(nicely played by Hal Holbrook) uncovers on a foggy April morning at the turn of midnight. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman round out a fine cast that help bring this underrated film to life, which also has an effective music score, and a whopping good ending. Was recently re-released on DVD by Shout/Scream factory in an excellent Special Edition that really brings out the texture of the widescreen(don't see this pan & scan!)

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

    I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin. It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified. The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death. "The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

    One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog. Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past. At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood. The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clich&eacute;d guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook. But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing. The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension. And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween. This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word... There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing. It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course. I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film. It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.

    I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.

    John Carpenter, fresh of his triumphant turn as director of "Halloween" directs and writes this atmospheric, chilling(though at times violent) ghost story of vengeful spirits from a sunken ship coming to ruin the centenary celebrations of Antonio Bay, a coastal community with a terrible secret that a priest,(nicely played by Hal Holbrook) uncovers on a foggy April morning at the turn of midnight. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman round out a fine cast that help bring this underrated film to life, which also has an effective music score, and a whopping good ending. Was recently re-released on DVD by Shout/Scream factory in an excellent Special Edition that really brings out the texture of the widescreen(don't see this pan & scan!)

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

    I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin. It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified. The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death. "The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

    One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog. Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past. At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood. The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clich&eacute;d guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook. But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing. The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies. THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers. The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie. The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension.

The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    John Carpenter, fresh of his triumphant turn as director of "Halloween" directs and writes this atmospheric, chilling(though at times violent) ghost story of vengeful spirits from a sunken ship coming to ruin the centenary celebrations of Antonio Bay, a coastal community with a terrible secret that a priest,(nicely played by Hal Holbrook) uncovers on a foggy April morning at the turn of midnight. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman round out a fine cast that help bring this underrated film to life, which also has an effective music score, and a whopping good ending. Was recently re-released on DVD by Shout/Scream factory in an excellent Special Edition that really brings out the texture of the widescreen(don't see this pan & scan!)

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

    I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin. It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified. The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death. "The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

    One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog. Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past. At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood. The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clich&eacute;d guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook. But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing. The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies. THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers. The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie. The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension. And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween. This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word... There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing. It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course. I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film. It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.

    I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog. Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past. At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood. The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clich&eacute;d guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook. But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing. The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies. THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers. The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie. The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension. And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween. This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word... There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing. It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course. I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film. It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.

    I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.

    John Carpenter, fresh of his triumphant turn as director of "Halloween" directs and writes this atmospheric, chilling(though at times violent) ghost story of vengeful spirits from a sunken ship coming to ruin the centenary celebrations of Antonio Bay, a coastal community with a terrible secret that a priest,(nicely played by Hal Holbrook) uncovers on a foggy April morning at the turn of midnight. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman round out a fine cast that help bring this underrated film to life, which also has an effective music score, and a whopping good ending. Was recently re-released on DVD by Shout/Scream factory in an excellent Special Edition that really brings out the texture of the widescreen(don't see this pan & scan!)

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

    I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin. It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified. The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death. "The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

    One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies. THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers. The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie. The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension. And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween. This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word... There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing. It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course. I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film. It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.

    I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.

    John Carpenter, fresh of his triumphant turn as director of "Halloween" directs and writes this atmospheric, chilling(though at times violent) ghost story of vengeful spirits from a sunken ship coming to ruin the centenary celebrations of Antonio Bay, a coastal community with a terrible secret that a priest,(nicely played by Hal Holbrook) uncovers on a foggy April morning at the turn of midnight. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman round out a fine cast that help bring this underrated film to life, which also has an effective music score, and a whopping good ending. Was recently re-released on DVD by Shout/Scream factory in an excellent Special Edition that really brings out the texture of the widescreen(don't see this pan & scan!)

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

    I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin. It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified. The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death. "The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

    One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog. Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past. At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood. The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clich&eacute;d guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook. But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing. The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

    "I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension. And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.

    It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween. This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word... There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing. It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course. I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film. It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.

    I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.

    John Carpenter, fresh of his triumphant turn as director of "Halloween" directs and writes this atmospheric, chilling(though at times violent) ghost story of vengeful spirits from a sunken ship coming to ruin the centenary celebrations of Antonio Bay, a coastal community with a terrible secret that a priest,(nicely played by Hal Holbrook) uncovers on a foggy April morning at the turn of midnight. Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman round out a fine cast that help bring this underrated film to life, which also has an effective music score, and a whopping good ending. Was recently re-released on DVD by Shout/Scream factory in an excellent Special Edition that really brings out the texture of the widescreen(don't see this pan & scan!)

    The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance. The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.

    I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin. It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified. The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death. "The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today. "The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.

    One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

    Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog. Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past. At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood. The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clich&eacute;d guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook. But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing. The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.

    The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic. The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town. The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic. The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett. John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John. The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies. THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers. The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie. The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!). While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!

But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog." This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension.

The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.
