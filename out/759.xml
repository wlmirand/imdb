    The makers of this idiotic actioner are thoughtful enough to include several scenes in which Cindy Crawford takes a shower, but that's it for the plusses. Lawyer go on run. Cop help. Villain chase. There's your plot. Crawford is, of course, laughably unconvincing as both a lawyer and an actress, although she's given no help at all by the clich&eacute;d dialogue, predictable action or the equally lousy performances that surround her; Steven Berkoff uses his dial-a-villain hotline to phone it in as usual. This is tiresome stuff all right, generating not an ounce of excitement or suspense and wading through its high body count with no grace at all. Remarkably dull.

    Cindy Crawford gives probably the worst acting performance i have ever seen. Nevertheless, one can't help but enjoy watching her. She has no conviction in any of her lines and displays completely the wrong type of body language for a woman who is almost blown up and on the run. However, she is so strikingly beautiful and naive in terms of her acting ability that she is fun to watch. You can forget about a proper storyline. The film is all about Crawford and the camera focuses on her extensively, it's a series of photo shots rolled into a couple of action scenes. Unfortunately, in between the dialogue is so bad it's laughable. Despite the poor acting and cheesy lines, there are some good action scenes and the chemistry between Crawford and Baldwin is entertaining to watch. This film is so bad that it's actually quite good.

    I am in love with Cindy Crawford. In common, I would have thought, with just about every heterosexual male old enough to remember the Golden Age of the Supermodel in the nineties. It's not just that Cindy is beautiful- although she must count as one of the loveliest women of her generation- but also that she possesses a grace and dignity which set her apart from certain other supermodels who are notable less for their modelling work than for their tempestuous sex lives, for their temper tantrums and for their addiction to alcohol, cocaine and blood diamonds. No names mentioned. Blessed with the looks of a Hollywood goddess, Cindy evidently thought she would try to become one. She was not the only supermodel to have had this idea in the mid-nineties; Elle Macpherson and Naomi Campbell also tried their hand at acting around the same time. They, however, contented themselves with supporting roles (such as Elle's appearance as Blanche Ingram in Zeffirelli's version of "Jane Eyre"), whereas in "Fair Game" Cindy finds herself cast in a leading role. She stars as Kate McQuean, a Florida lawyer who inadvertently falls foul of the Russian mafia. As Kate has a civil law practice concentrating on divorce and no involvement with criminal law enforcement, exactly what she has done to upset them would take too long to explain here; suffice it to say that they want her dead. She is therefore forced to go on the run with Max Kirkpatrick, the police officer charged with protecting her. Contrary to a widely held belief, beauty alone is not enough to make you a film star. At any given time there must be hundreds, if not thousands, of aspiring young wannabes in Hollywood, nearly all of them strikingly attractive. The few who make it to the top must, therefore, have something more than their beauty to set them apart from their less successful rivals, and that something is normally a modicum of real talent. (Although in a few cases an influential or well-connected husband or boyfriend will suffice, thus accounting for the fact that some attractive but genuinely talentless actresses have enjoyed quite lengthy careers at the top. Again, no names mentioned). Much as I love Cindy, I have to admit that genuine talent is something she lacks, at least as far as acting is concerned. One critic said of this film that "One could scavenge the thesaurus to find synonyms for 'awkward' to describe Crawford's performance," although actually "awkward" would be perhaps a milder criticism than many people would use. The lovely Cindy, I'm afraid, spends the entire film looking as though she has no idea what she is doing. She was nominated for a Worst Actress Razzie, but lost out to Elizabeth Berkeley for her role in "Showgirls". (Actually, whatever one might think about the merits of Paul Verhoeven's film, Berkeley's performance is a lot more animated and lively than Crawford's). One cannot, however, place the blame for the failure of this film on Cindy alone, or even on the standards of acting alone. (William Baldwin is not as wooden as his co-star, but even so he still, on this evidence, has a lot to do before he can live down the accusation that he is not even the best actor in his family). The film was made in 1995, several years after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, but Hollywood was still pursuing its own private cold war against all things Russian. The old clich&eacute; of Russians as villainous communists was simply replaced by a new clich&eacute; of Russians as villainous fascists or villainous gangsters; the main baddie here is a former Colonel in the KGB. (See also "Crimson Tide", "GoldenEye", "The Peacemaker", "Air Force One", etc.) This new clich&eacute; did not end with the nineties. By chance "Fair Game" was shown on British television on the same evening as "Salt", made as recently as 2010. Although "Salt" is a better film than "Fair Game", it still relies on the sort of Russophobic prejudices which should have come down with the Berlin Wall nearly a quarter of a century ago. Salt, however, does have a decent plot- indeed, a rather ingenious one- something which "Fair Game" totally lacks. What storyline it possesses is little more than an excuse for repeated scenes of gunfire, explosions, and Kate and Max running for their lives pursued by the baddies, all leading up to a totally predictable ending. It is hardly surprising that Cindy did not go on to a major film career. 3/10

    When I first saw this movie I practically hated it. It was little more than a try-hard action movie created to flaunt Cindy Crawford's apparently attractive body. Personally I think supermodels are way overrated, and though that may be attractive, they are far from being the goddesses that people treat them as. This movie, is simply little more than a vain attempt to introduce Crawford to the acting scene, and fortunately she did not stay. One may say that she is more than just a pretty face, but when it comes to acting, one should look in another area. Basically Crawford is a civil litigator who gets mixed up in a KGB plot to steal a lot of money, simply because she is using the divorce court to claim a ship that happens to be the KGB's base. She runs into a cop, played by Stephen Baldrin and inevitably they have sex and beat up the bad guys. The sex scene here is quite trashy, and in fact they get caught with their pants down. Personally this movie is little more than mindless pap. While it is okay to watch, it really goes little beyond that. The bad guys are interesting and use some nasty technology, but this is all lost on the fact that for all their skill and ability, a lawyer and a cop manage to beat them, and they don't even seem to break a sweat. This movie makes the KBG look like a bunch of bumbling idiots that couldn't steal a poster from the wall - and it isn't even a comedy. Personally, if you are bored, then watch it, but if you have better things to do, then it is best that you do them.

    Fair Game, a book written by Paula Gosling gets a reboot for the second time but with a different cast. Nine years before this movie, Cobra (1986) which starred Sylvester Stallone in an action packed film that was great to watch. In this film, the story is more or less the same except it has a totally different cast. This is not a horrible film but I feel that it could have used some more work. Starring in this film is William Baldwin, who earned his stardom in Backdraft (1991). Co-Starring with him is Cindy Crawford in her first feature film. Besides these two, I really didn't know any of the actors. However, Salma Hayek does appear in this movie but as a very minor, irrelevant character (unfortunately), she's actually pretty funny for the minutes she shows up. This movie is one whole big chase scene but most of it is entertaining. Sometimes it can get annoying because Baldwin and Crawford's characters are forced to argue with each other due to the screenplay. Then you have the moments where they actually cooperate and that's always a nice relief. There are also some scenes that have some comedy. I liked the part where Baldwin talks to the bad guys through a regular phone but not by directly calling them. When he does this, a store cashier gets involved in the conversation, I couldn't stop laughing. The action is good in this movie. There's plenty of big explosions; cars, houses, boats, you name it. For the musical score, Mark Mancina composed and conducted for the background of this film. It has an interesting beat that keeps the movie on its toes. I guess what sinks this movie is the plot. It just seems so weird how a small group of terrorists can do so much damage and get away with so little. Obviously this is not the greatest movie ever to hit the big screen but it can please action fans to a point because that is the strong element in this film. As the second adaptation to Gosling's book, other than Stallone's Cobra (1986), this film is mostly unrealistic because of how the plot was written up. All in all, it makes a good popcorn flick for when you just want to sit down and watch some random action movie; but that's about it.

    This movie was perhaps not the most accurate when it comes to effects, cars don't explode when they make contact with stationary objects, but isn't movies some entertainment? The movie caught on quite quickly, no slogging with getting to know characters just some prime action directly. Cindy isn't perhaps the most capable actress but she is fair to look at. I liked the movie, it tickled some laughs and gave my some entertaining moments. I rate this much higher than a lot of drama that seems to be the only thing people like these days. I might have things go another way if I where to shoot this movie, but the action was good, even though it was predictable sometimes.

    i actually enjoyed this film, we know cindy Crawford isn't the academy award actor, but simply this movie had an amazing ambiance to it, the Miami setting, the score of mark mancina simply amazing let's you get involved, the cinematography was good, bad script and bad plots doesn't mean the viewer doesn't enjoy the movie, it doesn't have to be that bad script makes a bad movie, these types of films are for fun, entertainment, it doesn't want to be serious more than it has to be, i recommend it for all action lovers, this is the same as Armageddon,deep impact,the specialist, these movies are for fun, not every movie has to have a strong plot.

    lol i saw a review for this film the other day and was told it was terrible which i disagreed with i rememberer watching this 12 years ago when i was 14 and thought it was amazing but when watched it last night i thought it was absolutely terrible maybe watching it as a hormone obsessed teenager seeing cindy crawford probably made me have favourable memories of the films but its not so good watching it as a adult some silly moments and remarkable that with everyone trying to kill her in the film she doesn't seem to show any emotion to it whatsoever also heard the old stallone film cobra is based on this think ill give that a try instead its good to watch once but don't buy it on DVD you will feel like getting a refund if you do

    You would think that combining a generic action movie with one of the most beautiful women in the world would be a foolproof formula. Have a few people get shot, blow something up real good and make Cindy Crawford take her top off. What could possibly go wrong? Well, if you watch Fair Game you'll know the answer to that question isso very, very much. I've seen coloring books better written than this script. I've witnessed better acting jobs from cigar store Indians. And I've had fever dreams that made more logical sense than this movie. The long and the short of this paint-by-numbers story is that Miami lawyer Katherine McQueen (Cindy Crawford) invokes a little know aspect of maritime law that throws a monkey wrench into the plans of some former KBG agents to steal the ludicrous sum of 957 million dollars. They try and kill Katherine, sending her into the protective arms and slicked back hairdo of detective Max Kirkpatrick (William Baldwin). Unable to get help from other cops because of the ex-KGB agents improbable skill at impersonating law enforcement, Katherine and Max are forced to flee on their own by car and train before everything winds up on a boat off the Florida coast, where the bad guy manages to get both blown up and drowned while Katherine and Max escape a fireball by jumping in slow motion. Yeah, it's that kind of film. To call Fair Game trash would be an insult to used tissues and half-eaten cinnamon buns. It's predictable, ridiculous and stupid, frequently all at once. Crawford shows all the acting ability of a seasick sea slug. The most entertaining thing about the whole movie is comparing the amateur bad acting of Crawford with the professional bad acting of William Baldwin, who conclusively proves here that he's the least talented of all the Baldwin brothers. In fact, watching this will make you suspect Baldwin was actually adopted and just had plastic surgery so he'd resemble the others. When you make Daniel Baldwin look like a master thespian, you should really find another line of work. The only possible reason anyone could ever have for renting this DVD is if you enjoy making fun of truly terrible films. From Crawford's breasts having the power to cloud men's minds to Salma Hayek as Max's inexplicable ex-girlfriend to Christopher McDonald playing Max's lieutenant like he has a lit blowtorch shoved up his ass, it's hard not to laugh at much of this crap. Fair Game is such a poorly contrived disaster that it almost morphs into a parody of bad action flicks. When Fair Game was produced, Crawford was still one of the most famous and attractive women in the world, so you really can't blame anyone for trying to make a movie star out of her. She certainly was a no more unlikely candidate for cinema stardom than a mush mouthed bodybuilder from Austria. But this film demonstrates why Crawford's career on camera peaked with MTV's House of Style and the embarrassment it caused Crawford is probably one of the main things that pushed Tyra Banks away from movies and into reality TV. So that's another thing we can blame on this film. Unless you're planning to watch/mock it among friends, skip Fair Game.

    I was fueling at the truck stop in Florida,chatting with the hog hauler fueling at the pump next to me. He was telling me about the time he had pulled off the road to take his 8 hour break,when a bunch of Russians pulled him out of his truck at gun point. Made him open his trailer,all the time yelling "Where are they". One had a g.p.s. locater device. He makes his way thru the hogs and stops about half way through the trailer. Stops ,reaches down through the hop crap, and picks up a cell phone. Im thinking,"Some truck drivers have nothing better to do but think up wild stories to tell his fellow truckers." Cindy Crawford,Selma Hayek,Johann Carlo, and Jenette Goldstein are hot!! ---One Truck Drivers Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com

    i actually enjoyed this film, we know cindy Crawford isn't the academy award actor, but simply this movie had an amazing ambiance to it, the Miami setting, the score of mark mancina simply amazing let's you get involved, the cinematography was good, bad script and bad plots doesn't mean the viewer doesn't enjoy the movie, it doesn't have to be that bad script makes a bad movie, these types of films are for fun, entertainment, it doesn't want to be serious more than it has to be, i recommend it for all action lovers, this is the same as Armageddon,deep impact,the specialist, these movies are for fun, not every movie has to have a strong plot.

    You would think that combining a generic action movie with one of the most beautiful women in the world would be a foolproof formula. Have a few people get shot, blow something up real good and make Cindy Crawford take her top off. What could possibly go wrong? Well, if you watch Fair Game you'll know the answer to that question isso very, very much. I've seen coloring books better written than this script. I've witnessed better acting jobs from cigar store Indians. And I've had fever dreams that made more logical sense than this movie. The long and the short of this paint-by-numbers story is that Miami lawyer Katherine McQueen (Cindy Crawford) invokes a little know aspect of maritime law that throws a monkey wrench into the plans of some former KBG agents to steal the ludicrous sum of 957 million dollars. They try and kill Katherine, sending her into the protective arms and slicked back hairdo of detective Max Kirkpatrick (William Baldwin). Unable to get help from other cops because of the ex-KGB agents improbable skill at impersonating law enforcement, Katherine and Max are forced to flee on their own by car and train before everything winds up on a boat off the Florida coast, where the bad guy manages to get both blown up and drowned while Katherine and Max escape a fireball by jumping in slow motion. Yeah, it's that kind of film. To call Fair Game trash would be an insult to used tissues and half-eaten cinnamon buns. It's predictable, ridiculous and stupid, frequently all at once. Crawford shows all the acting ability of a seasick sea slug. The most entertaining thing about the whole movie is comparing the amateur bad acting of Crawford with the professional bad acting of William Baldwin, who conclusively proves here that he's the least talented of all the Baldwin brothers. In fact, watching this will make you suspect Baldwin was actually adopted and just had plastic surgery so he'd resemble the others. When you make Daniel Baldwin look like a master thespian, you should really find another line of work. The only possible reason anyone could ever have for renting this DVD is if you enjoy making fun of truly terrible films. From Crawford's breasts having the power to cloud men's minds to Salma Hayek as Max's inexplicable ex-girlfriend to Christopher McDonald playing Max's lieutenant like he has a lit blowtorch shoved up his ass, it's hard not to laugh at much of this crap. Fair Game is such a poorly contrived disaster that it almost morphs into a parody of bad action flicks. When Fair Game was produced, Crawford was still one of the most famous and attractive women in the world, so you really can't blame anyone for trying to make a movie star out of her. She certainly was a no more unlikely candidate for cinema stardom than a mush mouthed bodybuilder from Austria. But this film demonstrates why Crawford's career on camera peaked with MTV's House of Style and the embarrassment it caused Crawford is probably one of the main things that pushed Tyra Banks away from movies and into reality TV. So that's another thing we can blame on this film. Unless you're planning to watch/mock it among friends, skip Fair Game.

    I was fueling at the truck stop in Florida,chatting with the hog hauler fueling at the pump next to me. He was telling me about the time he had pulled off the road to take his 8 hour break,when a bunch of Russians pulled him out of his truck at gun point. Made him open his trailer,all the time yelling "Where are they". One had a g.p.s. locater device. He makes his way thru the hogs and stops about half way through the trailer. Stops ,reaches down through the hop crap, and picks up a cell phone. Im thinking,"Some truck drivers have nothing better to do but think up wild stories to tell his fellow truckers." Cindy Crawford,Selma Hayek,Johann Carlo, and Jenette Goldstein are hot!! ---One Truck Drivers Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com

    The makers of this idiotic actioner are thoughtful enough to include several scenes in which Cindy Crawford takes a shower, but that's it for the plusses. Lawyer go on run. Cop help. Villain chase. There's your plot. Crawford is, of course, laughably unconvincing as both a lawyer and an actress, although she's given no help at all by the clich&eacute;d dialogue, predictable action or the equally lousy performances that surround her; Steven Berkoff uses his dial-a-villain hotline to phone it in as usual. This is tiresome stuff all right, generating not an ounce of excitement or suspense and wading through its high body count with no grace at all. Remarkably dull.

    Cindy Crawford gives probably the worst acting performance i have ever seen. Nevertheless, one can't help but enjoy watching her. She has no conviction in any of her lines and displays completely the wrong type of body language for a woman who is almost blown up and on the run. However, she is so strikingly beautiful and naive in terms of her acting ability that she is fun to watch. You can forget about a proper storyline. The film is all about Crawford and the camera focuses on her extensively, it's a series of photo shots rolled into a couple of action scenes. Unfortunately, in between the dialogue is so bad it's laughable. Despite the poor acting and cheesy lines, there are some good action scenes and the chemistry between Crawford and Baldwin is entertaining to watch. This film is so bad that it's actually quite good.

    I am in love with Cindy Crawford. In common, I would have thought, with just about every heterosexual male old enough to remember the Golden Age of the Supermodel in the nineties. It's not just that Cindy is beautiful- although she must count as one of the loveliest women of her generation- but also that she possesses a grace and dignity which set her apart from certain other supermodels who are notable less for their modelling work than for their tempestuous sex lives, for their temper tantrums and for their addiction to alcohol, cocaine and blood diamonds. No names mentioned. Blessed with the looks of a Hollywood goddess, Cindy evidently thought she would try to become one. She was not the only supermodel to have had this idea in the mid-nineties; Elle Macpherson and Naomi Campbell also tried their hand at acting around the same time. They, however, contented themselves with supporting roles (such as Elle's appearance as Blanche Ingram in Zeffirelli's version of "Jane Eyre"), whereas in "Fair Game" Cindy finds herself cast in a leading role. She stars as Kate McQuean, a Florida lawyer who inadvertently falls foul of the Russian mafia. As Kate has a civil law practice concentrating on divorce and no involvement with criminal law enforcement, exactly what she has done to upset them would take too long to explain here; suffice it to say that they want her dead. She is therefore forced to go on the run with Max Kirkpatrick, the police officer charged with protecting her. Contrary to a widely held belief, beauty alone is not enough to make you a film star. At any given time there must be hundreds, if not thousands, of aspiring young wannabes in Hollywood, nearly all of them strikingly attractive. The few who make it to the top must, therefore, have something more than their beauty to set them apart from their less successful rivals, and that something is normally a modicum of real talent. (Although in a few cases an influential or well-connected husband or boyfriend will suffice, thus accounting for the fact that some attractive but genuinely talentless actresses have enjoyed quite lengthy careers at the top. Again, no names mentioned). Much as I love Cindy, I have to admit that genuine talent is something she lacks, at least as far as acting is concerned. One critic said of this film that "One could scavenge the thesaurus to find synonyms for 'awkward' to describe Crawford's performance," although actually "awkward" would be perhaps a milder criticism than many people would use. The lovely Cindy, I'm afraid, spends the entire film looking as though she has no idea what she is doing. She was nominated for a Worst Actress Razzie, but lost out to Elizabeth Berkeley for her role in "Showgirls". (Actually, whatever one might think about the merits of Paul Verhoeven's film, Berkeley's performance is a lot more animated and lively than Crawford's). One cannot, however, place the blame for the failure of this film on Cindy alone, or even on the standards of acting alone. (William Baldwin is not as wooden as his co-star, but even so he still, on this evidence, has a lot to do before he can live down the accusation that he is not even the best actor in his family). The film was made in 1995, several years after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, but Hollywood was still pursuing its own private cold war against all things Russian. The old clich&eacute; of Russians as villainous communists was simply replaced by a new clich&eacute; of Russians as villainous fascists or villainous gangsters; the main baddie here is a former Colonel in the KGB. (See also "Crimson Tide", "GoldenEye", "The Peacemaker", "Air Force One", etc.) This new clich&eacute; did not end with the nineties. By chance "Fair Game" was shown on British television on the same evening as "Salt", made as recently as 2010. Although "Salt" is a better film than "Fair Game", it still relies on the sort of Russophobic prejudices which should have come down with the Berlin Wall nearly a quarter of a century ago. Salt, however, does have a decent plot- indeed, a rather ingenious one- something which "Fair Game" totally lacks. What storyline it possesses is little more than an excuse for repeated scenes of gunfire, explosions, and Kate and Max running for their lives pursued by the baddies, all leading up to a totally predictable ending. It is hardly surprising that Cindy did not go on to a major film career. 3/10

    When I first saw this movie I practically hated it. It was little more than a try-hard action movie created to flaunt Cindy Crawford's apparently attractive body. Personally I think supermodels are way overrated, and though that may be attractive, they are far from being the goddesses that people treat them as. This movie, is simply little more than a vain attempt to introduce Crawford to the acting scene, and fortunately she did not stay. One may say that she is more than just a pretty face, but when it comes to acting, one should look in another area. Basically Crawford is a civil litigator who gets mixed up in a KGB plot to steal a lot of money, simply because she is using the divorce court to claim a ship that happens to be the KGB's base. She runs into a cop, played by Stephen Baldrin and inevitably they have sex and beat up the bad guys. The sex scene here is quite trashy, and in fact they get caught with their pants down. Personally this movie is little more than mindless pap. While it is okay to watch, it really goes little beyond that. The bad guys are interesting and use some nasty technology, but this is all lost on the fact that for all their skill and ability, a lawyer and a cop manage to beat them, and they don't even seem to break a sweat. This movie makes the KBG look like a bunch of bumbling idiots that couldn't steal a poster from the wall - and it isn't even a comedy. Personally, if you are bored, then watch it, but if you have better things to do, then it is best that you do them.

    Fair Game, a book written by Paula Gosling gets a reboot for the second time but with a different cast. Nine years before this movie, Cobra (1986) which starred Sylvester Stallone in an action packed film that was great to watch. In this film, the story is more or less the same except it has a totally different cast. This is not a horrible film but I feel that it could have used some more work. Starring in this film is William Baldwin, who earned his stardom in Backdraft (1991). Co-Starring with him is Cindy Crawford in her first feature film. Besides these two, I really didn't know any of the actors. However, Salma Hayek does appear in this movie but as a very minor, irrelevant character (unfortunately), she's actually pretty funny for the minutes she shows up. This movie is one whole big chase scene but most of it is entertaining. Sometimes it can get annoying because Baldwin and Crawford's characters are forced to argue with each other due to the screenplay. Then you have the moments where they actually cooperate and that's always a nice relief. There are also some scenes that have some comedy. I liked the part where Baldwin talks to the bad guys through a regular phone but not by directly calling them. When he does this, a store cashier gets involved in the conversation, I couldn't stop laughing. The action is good in this movie. There's plenty of big explosions; cars, houses, boats, you name it. For the musical score, Mark Mancina composed and conducted for the background of this film. It has an interesting beat that keeps the movie on its toes. I guess what sinks this movie is the plot. It just seems so weird how a small group of terrorists can do so much damage and get away with so little. Obviously this is not the greatest movie ever to hit the big screen but it can please action fans to a point because that is the strong element in this film. As the second adaptation to Gosling's book, other than Stallone's Cobra (1986), this film is mostly unrealistic because of how the plot was written up. All in all, it makes a good popcorn flick for when you just want to sit down and watch some random action movie; but that's about it.

    This movie was perhaps not the most accurate when it comes to effects, cars don't explode when they make contact with stationary objects, but isn't movies some entertainment? The movie caught on quite quickly, no slogging with getting to know characters just some prime action directly. Cindy isn't perhaps the most capable actress but she is fair to look at. I liked the movie, it tickled some laughs and gave my some entertaining moments. I rate this much higher than a lot of drama that seems to be the only thing people like these days. I might have things go another way if I where to shoot this movie, but the action was good, even though it was predictable sometimes.

The bad guys are interesting and use some nasty technology, but this is all lost on the fact that for all their skill and ability, a lawyer and a cop manage to beat them, and they don't even seem to break a sweat. This movie makes the KBG look like a bunch of bumbling idiots that couldn't steal a poster from the wall - and it isn't even a comedy. Personally, if you are bored, then watch it, but if you have better things to do, then it is best that you do them.

    Fair Game, a book written by Paula Gosling gets a reboot for the second time but with a different cast. Nine years before this movie, Cobra (1986) which starred Sylvester Stallone in an action packed film that was great to watch. In this film, the story is more or less the same except it has a totally different cast. This is not a horrible film but I feel that it could have used some more work. Starring in this film is William Baldwin, who earned his stardom in Backdraft (1991). Co-Starring with him is Cindy Crawford in her first feature film. Besides these two, I really didn't know any of the actors. However, Salma Hayek does appear in this movie but as a very minor, irrelevant character (unfortunately), she's actually pretty funny for the minutes she shows up. This movie is one whole big chase scene but most of it is entertaining. Sometimes it can get annoying because Baldwin and Crawford's characters are forced to argue with each other due to the screenplay. Then you have the moments where they actually cooperate and that's always a nice relief. There are also some scenes that have some comedy. I liked the part where Baldwin talks to the bad guys through a regular phone but not by directly calling them. When he does this, a store cashier gets involved in the conversation, I couldn't stop laughing. The action is good in this movie. There's plenty of big explosions; cars, houses, boats, you name it. For the musical score, Mark Mancina composed and conducted for the background of this film. It has an interesting beat that keeps the movie on its toes. I guess what sinks this movie is the plot. It just seems so weird how a small group of terrorists can do so much damage and get away with so little. Obviously this is not the greatest movie ever to hit the big screen but it can please action fans to a point because that is the strong element in this film. As the second adaptation to Gosling's book, other than Stallone's Cobra (1986), this film is mostly unrealistic because of how the plot was written up. All in all, it makes a good popcorn flick for when you just want to sit down and watch some random action movie; but that's about it.

    This movie was perhaps not the most accurate when it comes to effects, cars don't explode when they make contact with stationary objects, but isn't movies some entertainment? The movie caught on quite quickly, no slogging with getting to know characters just some prime action directly. Cindy isn't perhaps the most capable actress but she is fair to look at. I liked the movie, it tickled some laughs and gave my some entertaining moments. I rate this much higher than a lot of drama that seems to be the only thing people like these days. I might have things go another way if I where to shoot this movie, but the action was good, even though it was predictable sometimes.

    i actually enjoyed this film, we know cindy Crawford isn't the academy award actor, but simply this movie had an amazing ambiance to it, the Miami setting, the score of mark mancina simply amazing let's you get involved, the cinematography was good, bad script and bad plots doesn't mean the viewer doesn't enjoy the movie, it doesn't have to be that bad script makes a bad movie, these types of films are for fun, entertainment, it doesn't want to be serious more than it has to be, i recommend it for all action lovers, this is the same as Armageddon,deep impact,the specialist, these movies are for fun, not every movie has to have a strong plot.

    You would think that combining a generic action movie with one of the most beautiful women in the world would be a foolproof formula. Have a few people get shot, blow something up real good and make Cindy Crawford take her top off. What could possibly go wrong? Well, if you watch Fair Game you'll know the answer to that question isso very, very much. I've seen coloring books better written than this script. I've witnessed better acting jobs from cigar store Indians. And I've had fever dreams that made more logical sense than this movie. The long and the short of this paint-by-numbers story is that Miami lawyer Katherine McQueen (Cindy Crawford) invokes a little know aspect of maritime law that throws a monkey wrench into the plans of some former KBG agents to steal the ludicrous sum of 957 million dollars. They try and kill Katherine, sending her into the protective arms and slicked back hairdo of detective Max Kirkpatrick (William Baldwin). Unable to get help from other cops because of the ex-KGB agents improbable skill at impersonating law enforcement, Katherine and Max are forced to flee on their own by car and train before everything winds up on a boat off the Florida coast, where the bad guy manages to get both blown up and drowned while Katherine and Max escape a fireball by jumping in slow motion. Yeah, it's that kind of film. To call Fair Game trash would be an insult to used tissues and half-eaten cinnamon buns. It's predictable, ridiculous and stupid, frequently all at once. Crawford shows all the acting ability of a seasick sea slug. The most entertaining thing about the whole movie is comparing the amateur bad acting of Crawford with the professional bad acting of William Baldwin, who conclusively proves here that he's the least talented of all the Baldwin brothers. In fact, watching this will make you suspect Baldwin was actually adopted and just had plastic surgery so he'd resemble the others. When you make Daniel Baldwin look like a master thespian, you should really find another line of work. The only possible reason anyone could ever have for renting this DVD is if you enjoy making fun of truly terrible films. From Crawford's breasts having the power to cloud men's minds to Salma Hayek as Max's inexplicable ex-girlfriend to Christopher McDonald playing Max's lieutenant like he has a lit blowtorch shoved up his ass, it's hard not to laugh at much of this crap. Fair Game is such a poorly contrived disaster that it almost morphs into a parody of bad action flicks. When Fair Game was produced, Crawford was still one of the most famous and attractive women in the world, so you really can't blame anyone for trying to make a movie star out of her. She certainly was a no more unlikely candidate for cinema stardom than a mush mouthed bodybuilder from Austria. But this film demonstrates why Crawford's career on camera peaked with MTV's House of Style and the embarrassment it caused Crawford is probably one of the main things that pushed Tyra Banks away from movies and into reality TV. So that's another thing we can blame on this film. Unless you're planning to watch/mock it among friends, skip Fair Game.

    I was fueling at the truck stop in Florida,chatting with the hog hauler fueling at the pump next to me. He was telling me about the time he had pulled off the road to take his 8 hour break,when a bunch of Russians pulled him out of his truck at gun point. Made him open his trailer,all the time yelling "Where are they". One had a g.p.s. locater device. He makes his way thru the hogs and stops about half way through the trailer. Stops ,reaches down through the hop crap, and picks up a cell phone. Im thinking,"Some truck drivers have nothing better to do but think up wild stories to tell his fellow truckers."

    The makers of this idiotic actioner are thoughtful enough to include several scenes in which Cindy Crawford takes a shower, but that's it for the plusses. Lawyer go on run. Cop help. Villain chase. There's your plot. Crawford is, of course, laughably unconvincing as both a lawyer and an actress, although she's given no help at all by the clich&eacute;d dialogue, predictable action or the equally lousy performances that surround her; Steven Berkoff uses his dial-a-villain hotline to phone it in as usual. This is tiresome stuff all right, generating not an ounce of excitement or suspense and wading through its high body count with no grace at all. Remarkably dull.

    Cindy Crawford gives probably the worst acting performance i have ever seen. Nevertheless, one can't help but enjoy watching her. She has no conviction in any of her lines and displays completely the wrong type of body language for a woman who is almost blown up and on the run. However, she is so strikingly beautiful and naive in terms of her acting ability that she is fun to watch. You can forget about a proper storyline. The film is all about Crawford and the camera focuses on her extensively, it's a series of photo shots rolled into a couple of action scenes. Unfortunately, in between the dialogue is so bad it's laughable. Despite the poor acting and cheesy lines, there are some good action scenes and the chemistry between Crawford and Baldwin is entertaining to watch. This film is so bad that it's actually quite good.

    I am in love with Cindy Crawford. In common, I would have thought, with just about every heterosexual male old enough to remember the Golden Age of the Supermodel in the nineties. It's not just that Cindy is beautiful- although she must count as one of the loveliest women of her generation- but also that she possesses a grace and dignity which set her apart from certain other supermodels who are notable less for their modelling work than for their tempestuous sex lives, for their temper tantrums and for their addiction to alcohol, cocaine and blood diamonds. No names mentioned. Blessed with the looks of a Hollywood goddess, Cindy evidently thought she would try to become one. She was not the only supermodel to have had this idea in the mid-nineties; Elle Macpherson and Naomi Campbell also tried their hand at acting around the same time. They, however, contented themselves with supporting roles (such as Elle's appearance as Blanche Ingram in Zeffirelli's version of "Jane Eyre"), whereas in "Fair Game" Cindy finds herself cast in a leading role. She stars as Kate McQuean, a Florida lawyer who inadvertently falls foul of the Russian mafia. As Kate has a civil law practice concentrating on divorce and no involvement with criminal law enforcement, exactly what she has done to upset them would take too long to explain here; suffice it to say that they want her dead. She is therefore forced to go on the run with Max Kirkpatrick, the police officer charged with protecting her. Contrary to a widely held belief, beauty alone is not enough to make you a film star. At any given time there must be hundreds, if not thousands, of aspiring young wannabes in Hollywood, nearly all of them strikingly attractive. The few who make it to the top must, therefore, have something more than their beauty to set them apart from their less successful rivals, and that something is normally a modicum of real talent. (Although in a few cases an influential or well-connected husband or boyfriend will suffice, thus accounting for the fact that some attractive but genuinely talentless actresses have enjoyed quite lengthy careers at the top. Again, no names mentioned). Much as I love Cindy, I have to admit that genuine talent is something she lacks, at least as far as acting is concerned. One critic said of this film that "One could scavenge the thesaurus to find synonyms for 'awkward' to describe Crawford's performance," although actually "awkward" would be perhaps a milder criticism than many people would use. The lovely Cindy, I'm afraid, spends the entire film looking as though she has no idea what she is doing. She was nominated for a Worst Actress Razzie, but lost out to Elizabeth Berkeley for her role in "Showgirls". (Actually, whatever one might think about the merits of Paul Verhoeven's film, Berkeley's performance is a lot more animated and lively than Crawford's). One cannot, however, place the blame for the failure of this film on Cindy alone, or even on the standards of acting alone. (William Baldwin is not as wooden as his co-star, but even so he still, on this evidence, has a lot to do before he can live down the accusation that he is not even the best actor in his family). The film was made in 1995, several years after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, but Hollywood was still pursuing its own private cold war against all things Russian. The old clich&eacute; of Russians as villainous communists was simply replaced by a new clich&eacute; of Russians as villainous fascists or villainous gangsters; the main baddie here is a former Colonel in the KGB. (See also "Crimson Tide", "GoldenEye", "The Peacemaker", "Air Force One", etc.) This new clich&eacute; did not end with the nineties. By chance "Fair Game" was shown on British television on the same evening as "Salt", made as recently as 2010. Although "Salt" is a better film than "Fair Game", it still relies on the sort of Russophobic prejudices which should have come down with the Berlin Wall nearly a quarter of a century ago. Salt, however, does have a decent plot- indeed, a rather ingenious one- something which "Fair Game" totally lacks. What storyline it possesses is little more than an excuse for repeated scenes of gunfire, explosions, and Kate and Max running for their lives pursued by the baddies, all leading up to a totally predictable ending. It is hardly surprising that Cindy did not go on to a major film career. 3/10

    When I first saw this movie I practically hated it. It was little more than a try-hard action movie created to flaunt Cindy Crawford's apparently attractive body. Personally I think supermodels are way overrated, and though that may be attractive, they are far from being the goddesses that people treat them as. This movie, is simply little more than a vain attempt to introduce Crawford to the acting scene, and fortunately she did not stay. One may say that she is more than just a pretty face, but when it comes to acting, one should look in another area. Basically Crawford is a civil litigator who gets mixed up in a KGB plot to steal a lot of money, simply because she is using the divorce court to claim a ship that happens to be the KGB's base. She runs into a cop, played by Stephen Baldrin and inevitably they have sex and beat up the bad guys. The sex scene here is quite trashy, and in fact they get caught with their pants down. Personally this movie is little more than mindless pap. While it is okay to watch, it really goes little beyond that. The bad guys are interesting and use some nasty technology, but this is all lost on the fact that for all their skill and ability, a lawyer and a cop manage to beat them, and they don't even seem to break a sweat. This movie makes the KBG look like a bunch of bumbling idiots that couldn't steal a poster from the wall - and it isn't even a comedy. Personally, if you are bored, then watch it, but if you have better things to do, then it is best that you do them.

They, however, contented themselves with supporting roles (such as Elle's appearance as Blanche Ingram in Zeffirelli's version of "Jane Eyre"), whereas in "Fair Game" Cindy finds herself cast in a leading role. She stars as Kate McQuean, a Florida lawyer who inadvertently falls foul of the Russian mafia. As Kate has a civil law practice concentrating on divorce and no involvement with criminal law enforcement, exactly what she has done to upset them would take too long to explain here; suffice it to say that they want her dead. She is therefore forced to go on the run with Max Kirkpatrick, the police officer charged with protecting her. Contrary to a widely held belief, beauty alone is not enough to make you a film star. At any given time there must be hundreds, if not thousands, of aspiring young wannabes in Hollywood, nearly all of them strikingly attractive. The few who make it to the top must, therefore, have something more than their beauty to set them apart from their less successful rivals, and that something is normally a modicum of real talent. (Although in a few cases an influential or well-connected husband or boyfriend will suffice, thus accounting for the fact that some attractive but genuinely talentless actresses have enjoyed quite lengthy careers at the top. Again, no names mentioned). Much as I love Cindy, I have to admit that genuine talent is something she lacks, at least as far as acting is concerned. One critic said of this film that "One could scavenge the thesaurus to find synonyms for 'awkward' to describe Crawford's performance," although actually "awkward" would be perhaps a milder criticism than many people would use. The lovely Cindy, I'm afraid, spends the entire film looking as though she has no idea what she is doing. She was nominated for a Worst Actress Razzie, but lost out to Elizabeth Berkeley for her role in "Showgirls". (Actually, whatever one might think about the merits of Paul Verhoeven's film, Berkeley's performance is a lot more animated and lively than Crawford's). One cannot, however, place the blame for the failure of this film on Cindy alone, or even on the standards of acting alone. (William Baldwin is not as wooden as his co-star, but even so he still, on this evidence, has a lot to do before he can live down the accusation that he is not even the best actor in his family). The film was made in 1995, several years after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, but Hollywood was still pursuing its own private cold war against all things Russian. The old clich&eacute; of Russians as villainous communists was simply replaced by a new clich&eacute; of Russians as villainous fascists or villainous gangsters; the main baddie here is a former Colonel in the KGB. (See also "Crimson Tide", "GoldenEye", "The Peacemaker", "Air Force One", etc.) This new clich&eacute; did not end with the nineties. By chance "Fair Game" was shown on British television on the same evening as "Salt", made as recently as 2010. Although "Salt" is a better film than "Fair Game", it still relies on the sort of Russophobic prejudices which should have come down with the Berlin Wall nearly a quarter of a century ago. Salt, however, does have a decent plot- indeed, a rather ingenious one- something which "Fair Game" totally lacks. What storyline it possesses is little more than an excuse for repeated scenes of gunfire, explosions, and Kate and Max running for their lives pursued by the baddies, all leading up to a totally predictable ending. It is hardly surprising that Cindy did not go on to a major film career. 3/10

    When I first saw this movie I practically hated it. It was little more than a try-hard action movie created to flaunt Cindy Crawford's apparently attractive body. Personally I think supermodels are way overrated, and though that may be attractive, they are far from being the goddesses that people treat them as. This movie, is simply little more than a vain attempt to introduce Crawford to the acting scene, and fortunately she did not stay. One may say that she is more than just a pretty face, but when it comes to acting, one should look in another area. Basically Crawford is a civil litigator who gets mixed up in a KGB plot to steal a lot of money, simply because she is using the divorce court to claim a ship that happens to be the KGB's base. She runs into a cop, played by Stephen Baldrin and inevitably they have sex and beat up the bad guys. The sex scene here is quite trashy, and in fact they get caught with their pants down. Personally this movie is little more than mindless pap. While it is okay to watch, it really goes little beyond that. The bad guys are interesting and use some nasty technology, but this is all lost on the fact that for all their skill and ability, a lawyer and a cop manage to beat them, and they don't even seem to break a sweat. This movie makes the KBG look like a bunch of bumbling idiots that couldn't steal a poster from the wall - and it isn't even a comedy. Personally, if you are bored, then watch it, but if you have better things to do, then it is best that you do them.

    Fair Game, a book written by Paula Gosling gets a reboot for the second time but with a different cast. Nine years before this movie, Cobra (1986) which starred Sylvester Stallone in an action packed film that was great to watch. In this film, the story is more or less the same except it has a totally different cast. This is not a horrible film but I feel that it could have used some more work. Starring in this film is William Baldwin, who earned his stardom in Backdraft (1991). Co-Starring with him is Cindy Crawford in her first feature film. Besides these two, I really didn't know any of the actors. However, Salma Hayek does appear in this movie but as a very minor, irrelevant character (unfortunately), she's actually pretty funny for the minutes she shows up. This movie is one whole big chase scene but most of it is entertaining. Sometimes it can get annoying because Baldwin and Crawford's characters are forced to argue with each other due to the screenplay. Then you have the moments where they actually cooperate and that's always a nice relief. There are also some scenes that have some comedy. I liked the part where Baldwin talks to the bad guys through a regular phone but not by directly calling them. When he does this, a store cashier gets involved in the conversation, I couldn't stop laughing. The action is good in this movie. There's plenty of big explosions; cars, houses, boats, you name it. For the musical score, Mark Mancina composed and conducted for the background of this film. It has an interesting beat that keeps the movie on its toes. I guess what sinks this movie is the plot. It just seems so weird how a small group of terrorists can do so much damage and get away with so little. Obviously this is not the greatest movie ever to hit the big screen but it can please action fans to a point because that is the strong element in this film. As the second adaptation to Gosling's book, other than Stallone's Cobra (1986), this film is mostly unrealistic because of how the plot was written up. All in all, it makes a good popcorn flick for when you just want to sit down and watch some random action movie; but that's about it.

    This movie was perhaps not the most accurate when it comes to effects, cars don't explode when they make contact with stationary objects, but isn't movies some entertainment? The movie caught on quite quickly, no slogging with getting to know characters just some prime action directly. Cindy isn't perhaps the most capable actress but she is fair to look at. I liked the movie, it tickled some laughs and gave my some entertaining moments. I rate this much higher than a lot of drama that seems to be the only thing people like these days. I might have things go another way if I where to shoot this movie, but the action was good, even though it was predictable sometimes.

    i actually enjoyed this film, we know cindy Crawford isn't the academy award actor, but simply this movie had an amazing ambiance to it, the Miami setting, the score of mark mancina simply amazing let's you get involved, the cinematography was good, bad script and bad plots doesn't mean the viewer doesn't enjoy the movie, it doesn't have to be that bad script makes a bad movie, these types of films are for fun, entertainment, it doesn't want to be serious more than it has to be, i recommend it for all action lovers, this is the same as Armageddon,deep impact,the specialist, these movies are for fun, not every movie has to have a strong plot.

    lol i saw a review for this film the other day and was told it was terrible which i disagreed with i rememberer watching this 12 years ago when i was 14 and thought it was amazing but when watched it last night i thought it was absolutely terrible maybe watching it as a hormone obsessed teenager seeing cindy crawford probably made me have favourable memories of the films but its not so good watching it as a adult some silly moments and remarkable that with everyone trying to kill her in the film she doesn't seem to show any emotion to it whatsoever also heard the old stallone film cobra is based on this think ill give that a try instead its good to watch once but don't buy it on DVD you will feel like getting a refund if you do

    You would think that combining a generic action movie with one of the most beautiful women in the world would be a foolproof formula. Have a few people get shot, blow something up real good and make Cindy Crawford take her top off. What could possibly go wrong? Well, if you watch Fair Game you'll know the answer to that question isso very, very much. I've seen coloring books better written than this script. I've witnessed better acting jobs from cigar store Indians. And I've had fever dreams that made more logical sense than this movie. The long and the short of this paint-by-numbers story is that Miami lawyer Katherine McQueen (Cindy Crawford) invokes a little know aspect of maritime law that throws a monkey wrench into the plans of some former KBG agents to steal the ludicrous sum of 957 million dollars. They try and kill Katherine, sending her into the protective arms and slicked back hairdo of detective Max Kirkpatrick (William Baldwin). Unable to get help from other cops because of the ex-KGB agents improbable skill at impersonating law enforcement, Katherine and Max are forced to flee on their own by car and train before everything winds up on a boat off the Florida coast, where the bad guy manages to get both blown up and drowned while Katherine and Max escape a fireball by jumping in slow motion. Yeah, it's that kind of film. To call Fair Game trash would be an insult to used tissues and half-eaten cinnamon buns. It's predictable, ridiculous and stupid, frequently all at once. Crawford shows all the acting ability of a seasick sea slug. The most entertaining thing about the whole movie is comparing the amateur bad acting of Crawford with the professional bad acting of William Baldwin, who conclusively proves here that he's the least talented of all the Baldwin brothers. In fact, watching this will make you suspect Baldwin was actually adopted and just had plastic surgery so he'd resemble the others. When you make Daniel Baldwin look like a master thespian, you should really find another line of work. The only possible reason anyone could ever have for renting this DVD is if you enjoy making fun of truly terrible films. From Crawford's breasts having the power to cloud men's minds to Salma Hayek as Max's inexplicable ex-girlfriend to Christopher McDonald playing Max's lieutenant like he has a lit blowtorch shoved up his ass, it's hard not to laugh at much of this crap. Fair Game is such a poorly contrived disaster that it almost morphs into a parody of bad action flicks. When Fair Game was produced, Crawford was still one of the most famous and attractive women in the world, so you really can't blame anyone for trying to make a movie star out of her. She certainly was a no more unlikely candidate for cinema stardom than a mush mouthed bodybuilder from Austria. But this film demonstrates why Crawford's career on camera peaked with MTV's House of Style and the embarrassment it caused Crawford is probably one of the main things that pushed Tyra Banks away from movies and into reality TV. So that's another thing we can blame on this film. Unless you're planning to watch/mock it among friends, skip Fair Game.

    I was fueling at the truck stop in Florida,chatting with the hog hauler fueling at the pump next to me. He was telling me about the time he had pulled off the road to take his 8 hour break,when a bunch of Russians pulled him out of his truck at gun point. Made him open his trailer,all the time yelling "Where are they". One had a g.p.s. locater device. He makes his way thru the hogs and stops about half way through the trailer. Stops ,reaches down through the hop crap, and picks up a cell phone. Im thinking,"Some truck drivers have nothing better to do but think up wild stories to tell his fellow truckers." Cindy Crawford,Selma Hayek,Johann Carlo, and Jenette Goldstein are hot!! ---One Truck Drivers Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com
