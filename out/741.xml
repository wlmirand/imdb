 <sinopse>
  A group of idealistic, but frustrated, liberals succumb to the temptation of murdering rightwing pundits for their political beliefs.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jude, Luke, Marc, Paulie and Pete are liberal-minded roommates and grad students at a Iowa post-secondary institution. Every Sunday for the past year, they have hosted a dinner party, inviting a friend over to have an open-minded discussion about whatever topics are of interest. On a dark and stormy night when Pete was supposed to bring a friend for one of those dinners, he instead comes home with Zachary Cody, who rescued a stranded Pete whose car broke down. They invite Zach to stay for dinner instead of Pete's missing friend. They soon find out that Zach is among other things a racist neo-Nazi, which brings up a potentially dangerous situation for Jewish Marc and black Luke. After some physical altercations and verbal threats, Marc ends up stabbing Zach dead out of what he considers self-defense. As the friends discuss what to do about Zach, they finally come to the conclusion that in killing Zach, they have done society a service. So they ponder 'why not invite other ...

    Some very liberal grad college students have guests over to discuss politics. However after an incident with one ex-soldier, they start inviting over highly conservative individuals and poisoning them one by one. The movie is fun, I like the premise and the "graphics". However it's not serious or believable. I don't like how they put it together. For example the very first guest was a priest who was very offensive towards homosexuals. He was condescending and harsh. However he never indicated any intention to physically harm homosexual individuals. All he said was that he believed they were sinning badly, he wasn't carrying out any act on them. I don't think he was an appropriate way to start the killings at all, they should have started with some gun wielding far-right redneck who made multiple threats about killing black people or homosexuals. They could have then progressed to some fatcat individuals destroying the environment, poisoning water supplies, inducing slave labour. Even though the writers missed these opportunities to highlight the real issues, they do seem like liberals. The people with strong conservative viewpoints are portrayed as "illiterates". I realize we are seeing things from the point of the liberal college students, but there's more to it than that. A kind of dismissal of topics such as abortion as being something that should 'obviously' be allowed. I resent that, abortion is a really serious matter where you are terminating something that is a little too close to being a human for comfort and not a clear issue. I think they got the idea of Courtney B. Vance as being completely for the killings, and proactive with them sometimes, and that idea was great. At first one of the girls was against them, however she reversed it way too easy IMO. I think they should have kept her on as being the one who didn't like the idea. I think they did the ending more or less perfectly also, and it redeemed some of the offence against conservatives.

    This movie is a raw satire about intolerance. It' s not really about political right or left wing views, but about people who fail to understand what freedom of speech really is. The main characters don' t think about their own limits - just the other people' s. This group of elite students conceived their own mission, a mission to get rid of everybody who they think have the wrong opinions about the society. As mention in the movie - i you travel back in time and met the young artist Adolf Hitler, knowing what he would do as a grown man, would you kill him to save millions of lives? I probably would, but to change history - what consequences would that make for the future? That' s the question I asked myself... This is the debut for director Stacy Title, the theme is controversial, and the product has a visual style that appeal to me. The actors are very good, Title and her staff have apparently picked the right cast, and everybody did an outstanding job - even the guest stars. Stacy Title haven' t done anything memorable later in her professional career - which makes me wonder why, for with this production, she hit the nail on the head.

    A bunch of liberal grad students (played by then unknown Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Coutney B. Vance) accidentally kill, at dinner in their house, a seriously deranged conservative (Bill Paxton) and bury the body. They figure they did the world a favor and invite ultra conservatives to their house, poison them and bury the bodies in the back yard. Among the victims (in cameos) are Charles Durning, Mark Harmon and Jason Alexander. Nora Dunn plays a policewoman investigating all the disappearances. DARK dark black comedy but it's well-done. The script is sharp and witty and insults BOTH conservatives and liberals. With the sole exception of Vance (who's horrible) the acting is good and we see hunky Penner with his shirt off and walking around in his underwear. Well-directed too with a good eye to compositions and color. Great music score too. If you examine the plot closely there are loopholes and lapses in logic (like they bury about 10 people in their backyard and the neighbors never notice?) but still this is funny and makes you think. Ignored at the time of its release this made a little splash on VHS and deserves to be rediscovered.

    You could also call it, "before they were Stars". Especially true in the case of Cameron Diaz! Right now she's starring alongside Tom Cruise and others, but back then not that many really knew her (despite her breakout performance in the Mask). But it's not her movie, it's an ensemble picture. And everyone in it is really good. The movie is very talk-y and you might not like that. But it does dig deep into human psyche. And while it is very philosophical at the beginning, it gets almost primal towards the end. The good thing is, that you can decide if you want to enjoy the movie as wicked, dark comedy or really read between the lines and get all the stabs it takes (no pun intended) against humanity/society!

    This is a pretty amusing send up of self righteousness and political extremism on the small scale. Five liberal room mates -- Diaz, Eldard, Gish, Penner, and Vance -- at a university in Iowa share a full-course meal in their home with a young man who reveals himself to be an unashamed macho war monger. A fight breaks out and the guest easily overpowers the wimpy hosts but is stabbed in the back by one of them. The victim burps, falls to the floor and dies. For the most part, the instrument of the deliberate murders that follow is poisoned wine. Let me recount the names of some of the right-wing victims: Bill Paxton is the dedicated warrior; Charles Durning as a minister who thinks queers deserve to die of AIDS; Mark Harmon as the ne plus ultra of male chauvinism; Jason Alexander as a man devoted to despoiling the earth; Pamela Gien as a librarian who thinks that "Catcher in the Rye" is pornographic. She doesn't drink so she has to be stabbed in the back. But this is the kind of comedy that doesn't need an excess of gore to be funny, so there is no gore at all. The ludic element lies elsewhere -- partly in occasionally clever but noetic unknowables. Example: If you were alone with Hitler in 1929, knowing what you now know, would you let him live? Partly the humor lies in ancillary themes. The Gang of Five decide to bury their first victim in the back yard, resulting in a suspicious-looking mound of earth. They put a tomato plant on top to disguise its contours. Eventually they have half a dozen huge tomato plants growing on the graves and there is a super-abundance of red ripe home-grown tomatoes. At first they can the tomatoes but the cabinets are finally filled. Then they slice them and hang them up to be sun dried. The tomatoes keep coming and getting bigger. They begin skeet shooting the tomatoes. They swing at them with baseball bats. Their last supper is spaghetti with marinara sauce. Another scene has Carmen Diaz planting pansies around the borders of the graves but it simply make the place look more like a cemetery than ever. (She gets PO'd when Vance rips them out.) And one of the roomies is a painter. He recreates, in a monstrous manner, Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel. On the dining room ceiling. (It should have been Da Vinci's "The Last Supper.") They run into trouble when they manage to persuade a rabble-rousing, right-wing TV maniac, Ron Perlman, to have a good meal at their home. During the dinner, before he is served the "dessert" wine, he cheerfully admits that he only rants on television because of the ratings, that in actuality he is full of crap. He thinks both extremes are dangerous and that centrists control government and always will. And if he met Hitler alone in 1929? No, he wouldn't kill Hitler. (The hosts reach for the "dessert" wine.) Instead, he would do his best to talk Hitler out of his designs. The connivers hesitate, then scurry outside for a discussion. Left alone in the dining room, the phony right-wing nut job lights a cigar and wanders around. He's about to pour a glass of the "dessert" wine but it smells funny to him. Then he picks up a local paper and reads an item about all the missing locals. The penny drops and he stares back at the bottle of poisoned wine. Lieutenant Columbo should have such intuition. It's all kind of amusing, so why isn't it funnier than it is? Great material, nice photography and lighting, and no clunk performances, but I kept thinking what Ealing Studios might have done with this plot in the mid-1950s. There would have been less extravagance in the performances for one thing. The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification. But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it. I still wish it had been made in the mid-50s by Ealing, but it's kind of fun, and welcome relief from most of the garbage showing up on the screen lately.

    This movie brings up a lot of major and provocative questions. It is not a work of film art, but it is a work of psychological art. The thoughts and questions that I find myself having are far more penetrating than the aesthetic questions that I have about this film. Advice: try to answer and address the questions posed by the film, and don't try to analyze this film as a piece of visual or film art. It will be more rewarding for you. This is a great film for two reasons: one, the film presents a lot of issues that I think intellectuals should try to answer, and two, it shows off the acting skills of a lot of young actors (at the time). I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to have some questions to mull over.

    One of the blackest comedies of the 1990s portrays a group of left-wing activists murdering right-wingers at dinner. Yes, very grim, but they know how to keep everything in good taste the whole time. Probably the funniest character in the movie is Ron Perlman as a Rush Limbaugh type on TV (he calls for a return to the Reagan era). Admittedly, "The Last Supper" isn't any kind of masterpiece. I guess that they could have improved it some by looking into how these various individuals on both sides of the political aisle arrived at their views. But otherwise, it sure pleased me. Some of the ill-fated conservative characters made my skin crawl. Also starring Cameron Diaz, Courtney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, Bill Paxton and Charles Durning.

    It's 1909 and you're alone with a young artist named Adolph. Do you kill him? A hypothetical question becomes real for a group of friends (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, and Courtney B. Vance) that inadvertently have a gung ho ex-Marine (Bill Paxton) for dinner. They decide that the world could be a better place if they removed some of those who pollute it with their thoughts, words, and actions. Come on, you've probably thought of the idea too. Wouldn't America be a better place if someone had gotten rid of a few right-wing nut-jobs before they could do serious damage to the country? They choose one each Sunday - anti-gay (Charles Durning), anti-literacy (Pamela Gien), anti-environment (Jason Alexander), etc. - you guessed it, until they come up with what they consider the ultimate prize - a Rush Limbaugh type (Ron Perlman) that causes them to pause. Is he really bad, or just out for money and publicity? Is that a bad enough reason to kill him? The answer and ending were a perfect ending to a funny movie.

The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification. But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it.

    This movie brings up a lot of major and provocative questions. It is not a work of film art, but it is a work of psychological art. The thoughts and questions that I find myself having are far more penetrating than the aesthetic questions that I have about this film. Advice: try to answer and address the questions posed by the film, and don't try to analyze this film as a piece of visual or film art. It will be more rewarding for you. This is a great film for two reasons: one, the film presents a lot of issues that I think intellectuals should try to answer, and two, it shows off the acting skills of a lot of young actors (at the time). I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to have some questions to mull over.

    One of the blackest comedies of the 1990s portrays a group of left-wing activists murdering right-wingers at dinner. Yes, very grim, but they know how to keep everything in good taste the whole time. Probably the funniest character in the movie is Ron Perlman as a Rush Limbaugh type on TV (he calls for a return to the Reagan era). Admittedly, "The Last Supper" isn't any kind of masterpiece. I guess that they could have improved it some by looking into how these various individuals on both sides of the political aisle arrived at their views. But otherwise, it sure pleased me. Some of the ill-fated conservative characters made my skin crawl. Also starring Cameron Diaz, Courtney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, Bill Paxton and Charles Durning.

    It's 1909 and you're alone with a young artist named Adolph. Do you kill him? A hypothetical question becomes real for a group of friends (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, and Courtney B. Vance) that inadvertently have a gung ho ex-Marine (Bill Paxton) for dinner. They decide that the world could be a better place if they removed some of those who pollute it with their thoughts, words, and actions. Come on, you've probably thought of the idea too. Wouldn't America be a better place if someone had gotten rid of a few right-wing nut-jobs before they could do serious damage to the country? They choose one each Sunday - anti-gay (Charles Durning), anti-literacy (Pamela Gien), anti-environment (Jason Alexander), etc. - you guessed it, until they come up with what they consider the ultimate prize - a Rush Limbaugh type (Ron Perlman) that causes them to pause. Is he really bad, or just out for money and publicity? Is that a bad enough reason to kill him? The answer and ending were a perfect ending to a funny movie.

    Some very liberal grad college students have guests over to discuss politics. However after an incident with one ex-soldier, they start inviting over highly conservative individuals and poisoning them one by one. The movie is fun, I like the premise and the "graphics". However it's not serious or believable. I don't like how they put it together. For example the very first guest was a priest who was very offensive towards homosexuals. He was condescending and harsh. However he never indicated any intention to physically harm homosexual individuals. All he said was that he believed they were sinning badly, he wasn't carrying out any act on them. I don't think he was an appropriate way to start the killings at all, they should have started with some gun wielding far-right redneck who made multiple threats about killing black people or homosexuals. They could have then progressed to some fatcat individuals destroying the environment, poisoning water supplies, inducing slave labour. Even though the writers missed these opportunities to highlight the real issues, they do seem like liberals. The people with strong conservative viewpoints are portrayed as "illiterates". I realize we are seeing things from the point of the liberal college students, but there's more to it than that. A kind of dismissal of topics such as abortion as being something that should 'obviously' be allowed. I resent that, abortion is a really serious matter where you are terminating something that is a little too close to being a human for comfort and not a clear issue. I think they got the idea of Courtney B. Vance as being completely for the killings, and proactive with them sometimes, and that idea was great. At first one of the girls was against them, however she reversed it way too easy IMO. I think they should have kept her on as being the one who didn't like the idea. I think they did the ending more or less perfectly also, and it redeemed some of the offence against conservatives.

    This movie is a raw satire about intolerance. It' s not really about political right or left wing views, but about people who fail to understand what freedom of speech really is. The main characters don' t think about their own limits - just the other people' s. This group of elite students conceived their own mission, a mission to get rid of everybody who they think have the wrong opinions about the society. As mention in the movie - i you travel back in time and met the young artist Adolf Hitler, knowing what he would do as a grown man, would you kill him to save millions of lives? I probably would, but to change history - what consequences would that make for the future? That' s the question I asked myself... This is the debut for director Stacy Title, the theme is controversial, and the product has a visual style that appeal to me. The actors are very good, Title and her staff have apparently picked the right cast, and everybody did an outstanding job - even the guest stars. Stacy Title haven' t done anything memorable later in her professional career - which makes me wonder why, for with this production, she hit the nail on the head.

    A bunch of liberal grad students (played by then unknown Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Coutney B. Vance) accidentally kill, at dinner in their house, a seriously deranged conservative (Bill Paxton) and bury the body. They figure they did the world a favor and invite ultra conservatives to their house, poison them and bury the bodies in the back yard. Among the victims (in cameos) are Charles Durning, Mark Harmon and Jason Alexander. Nora Dunn plays a policewoman investigating all the disappearances. DARK dark black comedy but it's well-done. The script is sharp and witty and insults BOTH conservatives and liberals. With the sole exception of Vance (who's horrible) the acting is good and we see hunky Penner with his shirt off and walking around in his underwear. Well-directed too with a good eye to compositions and color. Great music score too. If you examine the plot closely there are loopholes and lapses in logic (like they bury about 10 people in their backyard and the neighbors never notice?) but still this is funny and makes you think. Ignored at the time of its release this made a little splash on VHS and deserves to be rediscovered.

    You could also call it, "before they were Stars". Especially true in the case of Cameron Diaz! Right now she's starring alongside Tom Cruise and others, but back then not that many really knew her (despite her breakout performance in the Mask). But it's not her movie, it's an ensemble picture. And everyone in it is really good. The movie is very talk-y and you might not like that. But it does dig deep into human psyche. And while it is very philosophical at the beginning, it gets almost primal towards the end. The good thing is, that you can decide if you want to enjoy the movie as wicked, dark comedy or really read between the lines and get all the stabs it takes (no pun intended) against humanity/society!

    This is a pretty amusing send up of self righteousness and political extremism on the small scale. Five liberal room mates -- Diaz, Eldard, Gish, Penner, and Vance -- at a university in Iowa share a full-course meal in their home with a young man who reveals himself to be an unashamed macho war monger. A fight breaks out and the guest easily overpowers the wimpy hosts but is stabbed in the back by one of them. The victim burps, falls to the floor and dies. For the most part, the instrument of the deliberate murders that follow is poisoned wine. Let me recount the names of some of the right-wing victims: Bill Paxton is the dedicated warrior; Charles Durning as a minister who thinks queers deserve to die of AIDS; Mark Harmon as the ne plus ultra of male chauvinism; Jason Alexander as a man devoted to despoiling the earth; Pamela Gien as a librarian who thinks that "Catcher in the Rye" is pornographic. She doesn't drink so she has to be stabbed in the back. But this is the kind of comedy that doesn't need an excess of gore to be funny, so there is no gore at all. The ludic element lies elsewhere -- partly in occasionally clever but noetic unknowables. Example: If you were alone with Hitler in 1929, knowing what you now know, would you let him live? Partly the humor lies in ancillary themes. The Gang of Five decide to bury their first victim in the back yard, resulting in a suspicious-looking mound of earth. They put a tomato plant on top to disguise its contours. Eventually they have half a dozen huge tomato plants growing on the graves and there is a super-abundance of red ripe home-grown tomatoes. At first they can the tomatoes but the cabinets are finally filled. Then they slice them and hang them up to be sun dried. The tomatoes keep coming and getting bigger. They begin skeet shooting the tomatoes. They swing at them with baseball bats. Their last supper is spaghetti with marinara sauce. Another scene has Carmen Diaz planting pansies around the borders of the graves but it simply make the place look more like a cemetery than ever. (She gets PO'd when Vance rips them out.) And one of the roomies is a painter. He recreates, in a monstrous manner, Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel. On the dining room ceiling. (It should have been Da Vinci's "The Last Supper.") They run into trouble when they manage to persuade a rabble-rousing, right-wing TV maniac, Ron Perlman, to have a good meal at their home. During the dinner, before he is served the "dessert" wine, he cheerfully admits that he only rants on television because of the ratings, that in actuality he is full of crap. He thinks both extremes are dangerous and that centrists control government and always will. And if he met Hitler alone in 1929? No, he wouldn't kill Hitler. (The hosts reach for the "dessert" wine.) Instead, he would do his best to talk Hitler out of his designs. The connivers hesitate, then scurry outside for a discussion. Left alone in the dining room, the phony right-wing nut job lights a cigar and wanders around. He's about to pour a glass of the "dessert" wine but it smells funny to him. Then he picks up a local paper and reads an item about all the missing locals. The penny drops and he stares back at the bottle of poisoned wine. Lieutenant Columbo should have such intuition. It's all kind of amusing, so why isn't it funnier than it is? Great material, nice photography and lighting, and no clunk performances, but I kept thinking what Ealing Studios might have done with this plot in the mid-1950s. There would have been less extravagance in the performances for one thing. The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification. But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it. I still wish it had been made in the mid-50s by Ealing, but it's kind of fun, and welcome relief from most of the garbage showing up on the screen lately.

She doesn't drink so she has to be stabbed in the back. But this is the kind of comedy that doesn't need an excess of gore to be funny, so there is no gore at all. The ludic element lies elsewhere -- partly in occasionally clever but noetic unknowables. Example: If you were alone with Hitler in 1929, knowing what you now know, would you let him live? Partly the humor lies in ancillary themes. The Gang of Five decide to bury their first victim in the back yard, resulting in a suspicious-looking mound of earth. They put a tomato plant on top to disguise its contours. Eventually they have half a dozen huge tomato plants growing on the graves and there is a super-abundance of red ripe home-grown tomatoes. At first they can the tomatoes but the cabinets are finally filled. Then they slice them and hang them up to be sun dried. The tomatoes keep coming and getting bigger. They begin skeet shooting the tomatoes. They swing at them with baseball bats. Their last supper is spaghetti with marinara sauce. Another scene has Carmen Diaz planting pansies around the borders of the graves but it simply make the place look more like a cemetery than ever. (She gets PO'd when Vance rips them out.) And one of the roomies is a painter. He recreates, in a monstrous manner, Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel. On the dining room ceiling. (It should have been Da Vinci's "The Last Supper.") They run into trouble when they manage to persuade a rabble-rousing, right-wing TV maniac, Ron Perlman, to have a good meal at their home. During the dinner, before he is served the "dessert" wine, he cheerfully admits that he only rants on television because of the ratings, that in actuality he is full of crap. He thinks both extremes are dangerous and that centrists control government and always will. And if he met Hitler alone in 1929? No, he wouldn't kill Hitler. (The hosts reach for the "dessert" wine.) Instead, he would do his best to talk Hitler out of his designs. The connivers hesitate, then scurry outside for a discussion. Left alone in the dining room, the phony right-wing nut job lights a cigar and wanders around. He's about to pour a glass of the "dessert" wine but it smells funny to him. Then he picks up a local paper and reads an item about all the missing locals. The penny drops and he stares back at the bottle of poisoned wine. Lieutenant Columbo should have such intuition. It's all kind of amusing, so why isn't it funnier than it is? Great material, nice photography and lighting, and no clunk performances, but I kept thinking what Ealing Studios might have done with this plot in the mid-1950s. There would have been less extravagance in the performances for one thing. The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification. But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it. I still wish it had been made in the mid-50s by Ealing, but it's kind of fun, and welcome relief from most of the garbage showing up on the screen lately.

    This movie brings up a lot of major and provocative questions. It is not a work of film art, but it is a work of psychological art. The thoughts and questions that I find myself having are far more penetrating than the aesthetic questions that I have about this film. Advice: try to answer and address the questions posed by the film, and don't try to analyze this film as a piece of visual or film art. It will be more rewarding for you. This is a great film for two reasons: one, the film presents a lot of issues that I think intellectuals should try to answer, and two, it shows off the acting skills of a lot of young actors (at the time). I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to have some questions to mull over.

    One of the blackest comedies of the 1990s portrays a group of left-wing activists murdering right-wingers at dinner. Yes, very grim, but they know how to keep everything in good taste the whole time. Probably the funniest character in the movie is Ron Perlman as a Rush Limbaugh type on TV (he calls for a return to the Reagan era). Admittedly, "The Last Supper" isn't any kind of masterpiece. I guess that they could have improved it some by looking into how these various individuals on both sides of the political aisle arrived at their views. But otherwise, it sure pleased me. Some of the ill-fated conservative characters made my skin crawl. Also starring Cameron Diaz, Courtney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, Bill Paxton and Charles Durning.

    It's 1909 and you're alone with a young artist named Adolph. Do you kill him? A hypothetical question becomes real for a group of friends (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, and Courtney B. Vance) that inadvertently have a gung ho ex-Marine (Bill Paxton) for dinner. They decide that the world could be a better place if they removed some of those who pollute it with their thoughts, words, and actions. Come on, you've probably thought of the idea too. Wouldn't America be a better place if someone had gotten rid of a few right-wing nut-jobs before they could do serious damage to the country? They choose one each Sunday - anti-gay (Charles Durning), anti-literacy (Pamela Gien), anti-environment (Jason Alexander), etc. - you guessed it, until they come up with what they consider the ultimate prize - a Rush Limbaugh type (Ron Perlman) that causes them to pause. Is he really bad, or just out for money and publicity? Is that a bad enough reason to kill him? The answer and ending were a perfect ending to a funny movie.

    Some very liberal grad college students have guests over to discuss politics. However after an incident with one ex-soldier, they start inviting over highly conservative individuals and poisoning them one by one. The movie is fun, I like the premise and the "graphics". However it's not serious or believable. I don't like how they put it together. For example the very first guest was a priest who was very offensive towards homosexuals. He was condescending and harsh. However he never indicated any intention to physically harm homosexual individuals. All he said was that he believed they were sinning badly, he wasn't carrying out any act on them. I don't think he was an appropriate way to start the killings at all, they should have started with some gun wielding far-right redneck who made multiple threats about killing black people or homosexuals. They could have then progressed to some fatcat individuals destroying the environment, poisoning water supplies, inducing slave labour. Even though the writers missed these opportunities to highlight the real issues, they do seem like liberals. The people with strong conservative viewpoints are portrayed as "illiterates". I realize we are seeing things from the point of the liberal college students, but there's more to it than that. A kind of dismissal of topics such as abortion as being something that should 'obviously' be allowed. I resent that, abortion is a really serious matter where you are terminating something that is a little too close to being a human for comfort and not a clear issue. I think they got the idea of Courtney B. Vance as being completely for the killings, and proactive with them sometimes, and that idea was great. At first one of the girls was against them, however she reversed it way too easy IMO. I think they should have kept her on as being the one who didn't like the idea. I think they did the ending more or less perfectly also, and it redeemed some of the offence against conservatives.

    This movie is a raw satire about intolerance. It' s not really about political right or left wing views, but about people who fail to understand what freedom of speech really is. The main characters don' t think about their own limits - just the other people' s. This group of elite students conceived their own mission, a mission to get rid of everybody who they think have the wrong opinions about the society. As mention in the movie - i you travel back in time and met the young artist Adolf Hitler, knowing what he would do as a grown man, would you kill him to save millions of lives? I probably would, but to change history - what consequences would that make for the future? That' s the question I asked myself... This is the debut for director Stacy Title, the theme is controversial, and the product has a visual style that appeal to me. The actors are very good, Title and her staff have apparently picked the right cast, and everybody did an outstanding job - even the guest stars. Stacy Title haven' t done anything memorable later in her professional career - which makes me wonder why, for with this production, she hit the nail on the head.

    A bunch of liberal grad students (played by then unknown Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Coutney B. Vance) accidentally kill, at dinner in their house, a seriously deranged conservative (Bill Paxton) and bury the body. They figure they did the world a favor and invite ultra conservatives to their house, poison them and bury the bodies in the back yard. Among the victims (in cameos) are Charles Durning, Mark Harmon and Jason Alexander. Nora Dunn plays a policewoman investigating all the disappearances. DARK dark black comedy but it's well-done. The script is sharp and witty and insults BOTH conservatives and liberals. With the sole exception of Vance (who's horrible) the acting is good and we see hunky Penner with his shirt off and walking around in his underwear. Well-directed too with a good eye to compositions and color. Great music score too. If you examine the plot closely there are loopholes and lapses in logic (like they bury about 10 people in their backyard and the neighbors never notice?) but still this is funny and makes you think. Ignored at the time of its release this made a little splash on VHS and deserves to be rediscovered.

But after this guy is killed, and then buried, the movie isn't as interesting (I enjoyed the subplot about the sheriff's missing girl case. But what does this have to do with the main story?). As for some of the other dinner guests, you've got an ideal cast: Jason Alexander, Mark Harmon, Charles Durning. But the movie seems too proud of itself. When these characters are not at the dinner table, I wasn't buying any of it. So, a marginal recommendation. **1/2 out of ****

    You could also call it, "before they were Stars". Especially true in the case of Cameron Diaz! Right now she's starring alongside Tom Cruise and others, but back then not that many really knew her (despite her breakout performance in the Mask). But it's not her movie, it's an ensemble picture. And everyone in it is really good. The movie is very talk-y and you might not like that. But it does dig deep into human psyche. And while it is very philosophical at the beginning, it gets almost primal towards the end. The good thing is, that you can decide if you want to enjoy the movie as wicked, dark comedy or really read between the lines and get all the stabs it takes (no pun intended) against humanity/society!

    This is a pretty amusing send up of self righteousness and political extremism on the small scale. Five liberal room mates -- Diaz, Eldard, Gish, Penner, and Vance -- at a university in Iowa share a full-course meal in their home with a young man who reveals himself to be an unashamed macho war monger. A fight breaks out and the guest easily overpowers the wimpy hosts but is stabbed in the back by one of them. The victim burps, falls to the floor and dies. For the most part, the instrument of the deliberate murders that follow is poisoned wine. Let me recount the names of some of the right-wing victims: Bill Paxton is the dedicated warrior; Charles Durning as a minister who thinks queers deserve to die of AIDS; Mark Harmon as the ne plus ultra of male chauvinism; Jason Alexander as a man devoted to despoiling the earth; Pamela Gien as a librarian who thinks that "Catcher in the Rye" is pornographic. She doesn't drink so she has to be stabbed in the back. But this is the kind of comedy that doesn't need an excess of gore to be funny, so there is no gore at all. The ludic element lies elsewhere -- partly in occasionally clever but noetic unknowables. Example: If you were alone with Hitler in 1929, knowing what you now know, would you let him live? Partly the humor lies in ancillary themes. The Gang of Five decide to bury their first victim in the back yard, resulting in a suspicious-looking mound of earth. They put a tomato plant on top to disguise its contours. Eventually they have half a dozen huge tomato plants growing on the graves and there is a super-abundance of red ripe home-grown tomatoes. At first they can the tomatoes but the cabinets are finally filled. Then they slice them and hang them up to be sun dried. The tomatoes keep coming and getting bigger. They begin skeet shooting the tomatoes. They swing at them with baseball bats. Their last supper is spaghetti with marinara sauce. Another scene has Carmen Diaz planting pansies around the borders of the graves but it simply make the place look more like a cemetery than ever. (She gets PO'd when Vance rips them out.) And one of the roomies is a painter. He recreates, in a monstrous manner, Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel. On the dining room ceiling. (It should have been Da Vinci's "The Last Supper.") They run into trouble when they manage to persuade a rabble-rousing, right-wing TV maniac, Ron Perlman, to have a good meal at their home. During the dinner, before he is served the "dessert" wine, he cheerfully admits that he only rants on television because of the ratings, that in actuality he is full of crap. He thinks both extremes are dangerous and that centrists control government and always will. And if he met Hitler alone in 1929? No, he wouldn't kill Hitler. (The hosts reach for the "dessert" wine.) Instead, he would do his best to talk Hitler out of his designs. The connivers hesitate, then scurry outside for a discussion. Left alone in the dining room, the phony right-wing nut job lights a cigar and wanders around. He's about to pour a glass of the "dessert" wine but it smells funny to him. Then he picks up a local paper and reads an item about all the missing locals. The penny drops and he stares back at the bottle of poisoned wine. Lieutenant Columbo should have such intuition. It's all kind of amusing, so why isn't it funnier than it is? Great material, nice photography and lighting, and no clunk performances, but I kept thinking what Ealing Studios might have done with this plot in the mid-1950s. There would have been less extravagance in the performances for one thing. The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification. But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it. I still wish it had been made in the mid-50s by Ealing, but it's kind of fun, and welcome relief from most of the garbage showing up on the screen lately.

    You could also call it, "before they were Stars". Especially true in the case of Cameron Diaz! Right now she's starring alongside Tom Cruise and others, but back then not that many really knew her (despite her breakout performance in the Mask). But it's not her movie, it's an ensemble picture. And everyone in it is really good. The movie is very talk-y and you might not like that. But it does dig deep into human psyche. And while it is very philosophical at the beginning, it gets almost primal towards the end. The good thing is, that you can decide if you want to enjoy the movie as wicked, dark comedy or really read between the lines and get all the stabs it takes (no pun intended) against humanity/society!

    This is a pretty amusing send up of self righteousness and political extremism on the small scale. Five liberal room mates -- Diaz, Eldard, Gish, Penner, and Vance -- at a university in Iowa share a full-course meal in their home with a young man who reveals himself to be an unashamed macho war monger. A fight breaks out and the guest easily overpowers the wimpy hosts but is stabbed in the back by one of them. The victim burps, falls to the floor and dies. For the most part, the instrument of the deliberate murders that follow is poisoned wine. Let me recount the names of some of the right-wing victims: Bill Paxton is the dedicated warrior; Charles Durning as a minister who thinks queers deserve to die of AIDS; Mark Harmon as the ne plus ultra of male chauvinism; Jason Alexander as a man devoted to despoiling the earth; Pamela Gien as a librarian who thinks that "Catcher in the Rye" is pornographic. She doesn't drink so she has to be stabbed in the back. But this is the kind of comedy that doesn't need an excess of gore to be funny, so there is no gore at all. The ludic element lies elsewhere -- partly in occasionally clever but noetic unknowables. Example: If you were alone with Hitler in 1929, knowing what you now know, would you let him live? Partly the humor lies in ancillary themes. The Gang of Five decide to bury their first victim in the back yard, resulting in a suspicious-looking mound of earth. They put a tomato plant on top to disguise its contours. Eventually they have half a dozen huge tomato plants growing on the graves and there is a super-abundance of red ripe home-grown tomatoes. At first they can the tomatoes but the cabinets are finally filled. Then they slice them and hang them up to be sun dried. The tomatoes keep coming and getting bigger. They begin skeet shooting the tomatoes. They swing at them with baseball bats. Their last supper is spaghetti with marinara sauce. Another scene has Carmen Diaz planting pansies around the borders of the graves but it simply make the place look more like a cemetery than ever. (She gets PO'd when Vance rips them out.) And one of the roomies is a painter. He recreates, in a monstrous manner, Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel. On the dining room ceiling. (It should have been Da Vinci's "The Last Supper.") They run into trouble when they manage to persuade a rabble-rousing, right-wing TV maniac, Ron Perlman, to have a good meal at their home. During the dinner, before he is served the "dessert" wine, he cheerfully admits that he only rants on television because of the ratings, that in actuality he is full of crap. He thinks both extremes are dangerous and that centrists control government and always will. And if he met Hitler alone in 1929? No, he wouldn't kill Hitler. (The hosts reach for the "dessert" wine.) Instead, he would do his best to talk Hitler out of his designs. The connivers hesitate, then scurry outside for a discussion. Left alone in the dining room, the phony right-wing nut job lights a cigar and wanders around. He's about to pour a glass of the "dessert" wine but it smells funny to him. Then he picks up a local paper and reads an item about all the missing locals. The penny drops and he stares back at the bottle of poisoned wine. Lieutenant Columbo should have such intuition. It's all kind of amusing, so why isn't it funnier than it is? Great material, nice photography and lighting, and no clunk performances, but I kept thinking what Ealing Studios might have done with this plot in the mid-1950s. There would have been less extravagance in the performances for one thing. The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification. But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it. I still wish it had been made in the mid-50s by Ealing, but it's kind of fun, and welcome relief from most of the garbage showing up on the screen lately.

    This movie brings up a lot of major and provocative questions. It is not a work of film art, but it is a work of psychological art. The thoughts and questions that I find myself having are far more penetrating than the aesthetic questions that I have about this film. Advice: try to answer and address the questions posed by the film, and don't try to analyze this film as a piece of visual or film art. It will be more rewarding for you. This is a great film for two reasons: one, the film presents a lot of issues that I think intellectuals should try to answer, and two, it shows off the acting skills of a lot of young actors (at the time). I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to have some questions to mull over.

    One of the blackest comedies of the 1990s portrays a group of left-wing activists murdering right-wingers at dinner. Yes, very grim, but they know how to keep everything in good taste the whole time. Probably the funniest character in the movie is Ron Perlman as a Rush Limbaugh type on TV (he calls for a return to the Reagan era). Admittedly, "The Last Supper" isn't any kind of masterpiece. I guess that they could have improved it some by looking into how these various individuals on both sides of the political aisle arrived at their views. But otherwise, it sure pleased me. Some of the ill-fated conservative characters made my skin crawl. Also starring Cameron Diaz, Courtney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, Bill Paxton and Charles Durning.

    It's 1909 and you're alone with a young artist named Adolph. Do you kill him? A hypothetical question becomes real for a group of friends (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, and Courtney B. Vance) that inadvertently have a gung ho ex-Marine (Bill Paxton) for dinner. They decide that the world could be a better place if they removed some of those who pollute it with their thoughts, words, and actions. Come on, you've probably thought of the idea too. Wouldn't America be a better place if someone had gotten rid of a few right-wing nut-jobs before they could do serious damage to the country? They choose one each Sunday - anti-gay (Charles Durning), anti-literacy (Pamela Gien), anti-environment (Jason Alexander), etc. - you guessed it, until they come up with what they consider the ultimate prize - a Rush Limbaugh type (Ron Perlman) that causes them to pause. Is he really bad, or just out for money and publicity? Is that a bad enough reason to kill him? The answer and ending were a perfect ending to a funny movie.

    Some very liberal grad college students have guests over to discuss politics. However after an incident with one ex-soldier, they start inviting over highly conservative individuals and poisoning them one by one. The movie is fun, I like the premise and the "graphics". However it's not serious or believable. I don't like how they put it together. For example the very first guest was a priest who was very offensive towards homosexuals. He was condescending and harsh. However he never indicated any intention to physically harm homosexual individuals. All he said was that he believed they were sinning badly, he wasn't carrying out any act on them. I don't think he was an appropriate way to start the killings at all, they should have started with some gun wielding far-right redneck who made multiple threats about killing black people or homosexuals. They could have then progressed to some fatcat individuals destroying the environment, poisoning water supplies, inducing slave labour. Even though the writers missed these opportunities to highlight the real issues, they do seem like liberals. The people with strong conservative viewpoints are portrayed as "illiterates". I realize we are seeing things from the point of the liberal college students, but there's more to it than that. A kind of dismissal of topics such as abortion as being something that should 'obviously' be allowed. I resent that, abortion is a really serious matter where you are terminating something that is a little too close to being a human for comfort and not a clear issue. I think they got the idea of Courtney B. Vance as being completely for the killings, and proactive with them sometimes, and that idea was great. At first one of the girls was against them, however she reversed it way too easy IMO. I think they should have kept her on as being the one who didn't like the idea. I think they did the ending more or less perfectly also, and it redeemed some of the offence against conservatives.

    This movie is a raw satire about intolerance. It' s not really about political right or left wing views, but about people who fail to understand what freedom of speech really is. The main characters don' t think about their own limits - just the other people' s. This group of elite students conceived their own mission, a mission to get rid of everybody who they think have the wrong opinions about the society. As mention in the movie - i you travel back in time and met the young artist Adolf Hitler, knowing what he would do as a grown man, would you kill him to save millions of lives? I probably would, but to change history - what consequences would that make for the future? That' s the question I asked myself... This is the debut for director Stacy Title, the theme is controversial, and the product has a visual style that appeal to me. The actors are very good, Title and her staff have apparently picked the right cast, and everybody did an outstanding job - even the guest stars. Stacy Title haven' t done anything memorable later in her professional career - which makes me wonder why, for with this production, she hit the nail on the head.

    A bunch of liberal grad students (played by then unknown Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Coutney B. Vance) accidentally kill, at dinner in their house, a seriously deranged conservative (Bill Paxton) and bury the body. They figure they did the world a favor and invite ultra conservatives to their house, poison them and bury the bodies in the back yard. Among the victims (in cameos) are Charles Durning, Mark Harmon and Jason Alexander. Nora Dunn plays a policewoman investigating all the disappearances. DARK dark black comedy but it's well-done. The script is sharp and witty and insults BOTH conservatives and liberals. With the sole exception of Vance (who's horrible) the acting is good and we see hunky Penner with his shirt off and walking around in his underwear. Well-directed too with a good eye to compositions and color. Great music score too. If you examine the plot closely there are loopholes and lapses in logic (like they bury about 10 people in their backyard and the neighbors never notice?) but still this is funny and makes you think. Ignored at the time of its release this made a little splash on VHS and deserves to be rediscovered.

    Group of grad students in Iowa--roommates living in a large house with a big backyard--invite a stranded trucker to dine with them one evening which ultimately results in a confrontation over beliefs and ideals, culminating in the man's demise. Soon after burying the obnoxious lout, the liberal gang comes to an agreement: why not clean up their state (and, thereby, the country) in the same fashion, one Conservative Republican at a time! Poorly-made dark comedy is shot and presented like a lame television show, even though the intrinsic idea in Dan Rosen's screenplay is a provocative one. The students share a united dilemma (how long should they let a potential victim ramble on with his or her hate-speech before they treat them to their brand of poisoned wine?), yet Rosen doesn't develop the ensuing turn of events with any aplomb. Worse, the liberal youths (meant to be as extremist-left as their victims are extremist-right) quickly turn smug and psychotic, losing their quirks and misguided appeal. *1/2 from ****

    I thought this was a good idea for a movie. Before seeing it, I had mixed feelings. From what I've seen, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be mediocre. Actually, it is that way as the movie progresses. And that's where the problem lies. Once it loses steam, it barely recovers. It gets off to an interesting start, as we watch Bill Paxton chatting with everyone. Then he gets really upset, accusing everyone of being politically incorrect. But after this guy is killed, and then buried, the movie isn't as interesting (I enjoyed the subplot about the sheriff's missing girl case. But what does this have to do with the main story?). As for some of the other dinner guests, you've got an ideal cast: Jason Alexander, Mark Harmon, Charles Durning. But the movie seems too proud of itself. When these characters are not at the dinner table, I wasn't buying any of it. So, a marginal recommendation. **1/2 out of ****

    You could also call it, "before they were Stars". Especially true in the case of Cameron Diaz! Right now she's starring alongside Tom Cruise and others, but back then not that many really knew her (despite her breakout performance in the Mask). But it's not her movie, it's an ensemble picture. And everyone in it is really good. The movie is very talk-y and you might not like that. But it does dig deep into human psyche. And while it is very philosophical at the beginning, it gets almost primal towards the end.

    Group of grad students in Iowa--roommates living in a large house with a big backyard--invite a stranded trucker to dine with them one evening which ultimately results in a confrontation over beliefs and ideals, culminating in the man's demise. Soon after burying the obnoxious lout, the liberal gang comes to an agreement: why not clean up their state (and, thereby, the country) in the same fashion, one Conservative Republican at a time! Poorly-made dark comedy is shot and presented like a lame television show, even though the intrinsic idea in Dan Rosen's screenplay is a provocative one. The students share a united dilemma (how long should they let a potential victim ramble on with his or her hate-speech before they treat them to their brand of poisoned wine?), yet Rosen doesn't develop the ensuing turn of events with any aplomb. Worse, the liberal youths (meant to be as extremist-left as their victims are extremist-right) quickly turn smug and psychotic, losing their quirks and misguided appeal. *1/2 from ****

    I thought this was a good idea for a movie. Before seeing it, I had mixed feelings. From what I've seen, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be mediocre. Actually, it is that way as the movie progresses. And that's where the problem lies. Once it loses steam, it barely recovers. It gets off to an interesting start, as we watch Bill Paxton chatting with everyone. Then he gets really upset, accusing everyone of being politically incorrect. But after this guy is killed, and then buried, the movie isn't as interesting (I enjoyed the subplot about the sheriff's missing girl case. But what does this have to do with the main story?). As for some of the other dinner guests, you've got an ideal cast: Jason Alexander, Mark Harmon, Charles Durning. But the movie seems too proud of itself. When these characters are not at the dinner table, I wasn't buying any of it. So, a marginal recommendation. **1/2 out of ****

    You could also call it, "before they were Stars". Especially true in the case of Cameron Diaz! Right now she's starring alongside Tom Cruise and others, but back then not that many really knew her (despite her breakout performance in the Mask). But it's not her movie, it's an ensemble picture. And everyone in it is really good. The movie is very talk-y and you might not like that. But it does dig deep into human psyche. And while it is very philosophical at the beginning, it gets almost primal towards the end. The good thing is, that you can decide if you want to enjoy the movie as wicked, dark comedy or really read between the lines and get all the stabs it takes (no pun intended) against humanity/society!

    This is a pretty amusing send up of self righteousness and political extremism on the small scale. Five liberal room mates -- Diaz, Eldard, Gish, Penner, and Vance -- at a university in Iowa share a full-course meal in their home with a young man who reveals himself to be an unashamed macho war monger. A fight breaks out and the guest easily overpowers the wimpy hosts but is stabbed in the back by one of them. The victim burps, falls to the floor and dies. For the most part, the instrument of the deliberate murders that follow is poisoned wine. Let me recount the names of some of the right-wing victims: Bill Paxton is the dedicated warrior; Charles Durning as a minister who thinks queers deserve to die of AIDS; Mark Harmon as the ne plus ultra of male chauvinism; Jason Alexander as a man devoted to despoiling the earth; Pamela Gien as a librarian who thinks that "Catcher in the Rye" is pornographic. She doesn't drink so she has to be stabbed in the back. But this is the kind of comedy that doesn't need an excess of gore to be funny, so there is no gore at all. The ludic element lies elsewhere -- partly in occasionally clever but noetic unknowables. Example: If you were alone with Hitler in 1929, knowing what you now know, would you let him live? Partly the humor lies in ancillary themes. The Gang of Five decide to bury their first victim in the back yard, resulting in a suspicious-looking mound of earth. They put a tomato plant on top to disguise its contours. Eventually they have half a dozen huge tomato plants growing on the graves and there is a super-abundance of red ripe home-grown tomatoes. At first they can the tomatoes but the cabinets are finally filled. Then they slice them and hang them up to be sun dried. The tomatoes keep coming and getting bigger. They begin skeet shooting the tomatoes. They swing at them with baseball bats. Their last supper is spaghetti with marinara sauce. Another scene has Carmen Diaz planting pansies around the borders of the graves but it simply make the place look more like a cemetery than ever. (She gets PO'd when Vance rips them out.) And one of the roomies is a painter. He recreates, in a monstrous manner, Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel. On the dining room ceiling. (It should have been Da Vinci's "The Last Supper.") They run into trouble when they manage to persuade a rabble-rousing, right-wing TV maniac, Ron Perlman, to have a good meal at their home. During the dinner, before he is served the "dessert" wine, he cheerfully admits that he only rants on television because of the ratings, that in actuality he is full of crap. He thinks both extremes are dangerous and that centrists control government and always will. And if he met Hitler alone in 1929? No, he wouldn't kill Hitler. (The hosts reach for the "dessert" wine.) Instead, he would do his best to talk Hitler out of his designs. The connivers hesitate, then scurry outside for a discussion. Left alone in the dining room, the phony right-wing nut job lights a cigar and wanders around. He's about to pour a glass of the "dessert" wine but it smells funny to him. Then he picks up a local paper and reads an item about all the missing locals. The penny drops and he stares back at the bottle of poisoned wine. Lieutenant Columbo should have such intuition. It's all kind of amusing, so why isn't it funnier than it is? Great material, nice photography and lighting, and no clunk performances, but I kept thinking what Ealing Studios might have done with this plot in the mid-1950s. There would have been less extravagance in the performances for one thing. The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification. But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it. I still wish it had been made in the mid-50s by Ealing, but it's kind of fun, and welcome relief from most of the garbage showing up on the screen lately.

    This movie brings up a lot of major and provocative questions. It is not a work of film art, but it is a work of psychological art. The thoughts and questions that I find myself having are far more penetrating than the aesthetic questions that I have about this film. Advice: try to answer and address the questions posed by the film, and don't try to analyze this film as a piece of visual or film art. It will be more rewarding for you. This is a great film for two reasons: one, the film presents a lot of issues that I think intellectuals should try to answer, and two, it shows off the acting skills of a lot of young actors (at the time). I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to have some questions to mull over.

    One of the blackest comedies of the 1990s portrays a group of left-wing activists murdering right-wingers at dinner. Yes, very grim, but they know how to keep everything in good taste the whole time. Probably the funniest character in the movie is Ron Perlman as a Rush Limbaugh type on TV (he calls for a return to the Reagan era). Admittedly, "The Last Supper" isn't any kind of masterpiece. I guess that they could have improved it some by looking into how these various individuals on both sides of the political aisle arrived at their views. But otherwise, it sure pleased me. Some of the ill-fated conservative characters made my skin crawl. Also starring Cameron Diaz, Courtney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, Bill Paxton and Charles Durning.

    It's 1909 and you're alone with a young artist named Adolph. Do you kill him? A hypothetical question becomes real for a group of friends (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, and Courtney B. Vance) that inadvertently have a gung ho ex-Marine (Bill Paxton) for dinner. They decide that the world could be a better place if they removed some of those who pollute it with their thoughts, words, and actions. Come on, you've probably thought of the idea too. Wouldn't America be a better place if someone had gotten rid of a few right-wing nut-jobs before they could do serious damage to the country? They choose one each Sunday - anti-gay (Charles Durning), anti-literacy (Pamela Gien), anti-environment (Jason Alexander), etc. - you guessed it, until they come up with what they consider the ultimate prize - a Rush Limbaugh type (Ron Perlman) that causes them to pause. Is he really bad, or just out for money and publicity? Is that a bad enough reason to kill him? The answer and ending were a perfect ending to a funny movie.

    Some very liberal grad college students have guests over to discuss politics. However after an incident with one ex-soldier, they start inviting over highly conservative individuals and poisoning them one by one. The movie is fun, I like the premise and the "graphics". However it's not serious or believable. I don't like how they put it together. For example the very first guest was a priest who was very offensive towards homosexuals. He was condescending and harsh. However he never indicated any intention to physically harm homosexual individuals. All he said was that he believed they were sinning badly, he wasn't carrying out any act on them. I don't think he was an appropriate way to start the killings at all, they should have started with some gun wielding far-right redneck who made multiple threats about killing black people or homosexuals. They could have then progressed to some fatcat individuals destroying the environment, poisoning water supplies, inducing slave labour. Even though the writers missed these opportunities to highlight the real issues, they do seem like liberals. The people with strong conservative viewpoints are portrayed as "illiterates". I realize we are seeing things from the point of the liberal college students, but there's more to it than that. A kind of dismissal of topics such as abortion as being something that should 'obviously' be allowed. I resent that, abortion is a really serious matter where you are terminating something that is a little too close to being a human for comfort and not a clear issue. I think they got the idea of Courtney B. Vance as being completely for the killings, and proactive with them sometimes, and that idea was great. At first one of the girls was against them, however she reversed it way too easy IMO. I think they should have kept her on as being the one who didn't like the idea. I think they did the ending more or less perfectly also, and it redeemed some of the offence against conservatives.

    This movie is a raw satire about intolerance. It' s not really about political right or left wing views, but about people who fail to understand what freedom of speech really is. The main characters don' t think about their own limits - just the other people' s. This group of elite students conceived their own mission, a mission to get rid of everybody who they think have the wrong opinions about the society. As mention in the movie - i you travel back in time and met the young artist Adolf Hitler, knowing what he would do as a grown man, would you kill him to save millions of lives? I probably would, but to change history - what consequences would that make for the future? That' s the question I asked myself... This is the debut for director Stacy Title, the theme is controversial, and the product has a visual style that appeal to me. The actors are very good, Title and her staff have apparently picked the right cast, and everybody did an outstanding job - even the guest stars. Stacy Title haven' t done anything memorable later in her professional career - which makes me wonder why, for with this production, she hit the nail on the head.

    A bunch of liberal grad students (played by then unknown Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Coutney B. Vance) accidentally kill, at dinner in their house, a seriously deranged conservative (Bill Paxton) and bury the body. They figure they did the world a favor and invite ultra conservatives to their house, poison them and bury the bodies in the back yard. Among the victims (in cameos) are Charles Durning, Mark Harmon and Jason Alexander. Nora Dunn plays a policewoman investigating all the disappearances. DARK dark black comedy but it's well-done. The script is sharp and witty and insults BOTH conservatives and liberals. With the sole exception of Vance (who's horrible) the acting is good and we see hunky Penner with his shirt off and walking around in his underwear. Well-directed too with a good eye to compositions and color. Great music score too. If you examine the plot closely there are loopholes and lapses in logic (like they bury about 10 people in their backyard and the neighbors never notice?) but still this is funny and makes you think. Ignored at the time of its release this made a little splash on VHS and deserves to be rediscovered.

I probably would, but to change history - what consequences would that make for the future? That' s the question I asked myself... This is the debut for director Stacy Title, the theme is controversial, and the product has a visual style that appeal to me. The actors are very good, Title and her staff have apparently picked the right cast, and everybody did an outstanding job - even the guest stars. Stacy Title haven' t done anything memorable later in her professional career - which makes me wonder why, for with this production, she hit the nail on the head.

    A bunch of liberal grad students (played by then unknown Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Coutney B. Vance) accidentally kill, at dinner in their house, a seriously deranged conservative (Bill Paxton) and bury the body. They figure they did the world a favor and invite ultra conservatives to their house, poison them and bury the bodies in the back yard. Among the victims (in cameos) are Charles Durning, Mark Harmon and Jason Alexander. Nora Dunn plays a policewoman investigating all the disappearances. DARK dark black comedy but it's well-done. The script is sharp and witty and insults BOTH conservatives and liberals. With the sole exception of Vance (who's horrible) the acting is good and we see hunky Penner with his shirt off and walking around in his underwear. Well-directed too with a good eye to compositions and color. Great music score too. If you examine the plot closely there are loopholes and lapses in logic (like they bury about 10 people in their backyard and the neighbors never notice?) but still this is funny and makes you think. Ignored at the time of its release this made a little splash on VHS and deserves to be rediscovered.

    Group of grad students in Iowa--roommates living in a large house with a big backyard--invite a stranded trucker to dine with them one evening which ultimately results in a confrontation over beliefs and ideals, culminating in the man's demise. Soon after burying the obnoxious lout, the liberal gang comes to an agreement: why not clean up their state (and, thereby, the country) in the same fashion, one Conservative Republican at a time! Poorly-made dark comedy is shot and presented like a lame television show, even though the intrinsic idea in Dan Rosen's screenplay is a provocative one. The students share a united dilemma (how long should they let a potential victim ramble on with his or her hate-speech before they treat them to their brand of poisoned wine?), yet Rosen doesn't develop the ensuing turn of events with any aplomb. Worse, the liberal youths (meant to be as extremist-left as their victims are extremist-right) quickly turn smug and psychotic, losing their quirks and misguided appeal. *1/2 from ****

    I thought this was a good idea for a movie. Before seeing it, I had mixed feelings. From what I've seen, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be mediocre. Actually, it is that way as the movie progresses. And that's where the problem lies. Once it loses steam, it barely recovers. It gets off to an interesting start, as we watch Bill Paxton chatting with everyone. Then he gets really upset, accusing everyone of being politically incorrect. But after this guy is killed, and then buried, the movie isn't as interesting (I enjoyed the subplot about the sheriff's missing girl case. But what does this have to do with the main story?). As for some of the other dinner guests, you've got an ideal cast: Jason Alexander, Mark Harmon, Charles Durning. But the movie seems too proud of itself. When these characters are not at the dinner table, I wasn't buying any of it. So, a marginal recommendation. **1/2 out of ****

    You could also call it, "before they were Stars". Especially true in the case of Cameron Diaz! Right now she's starring alongside Tom Cruise and others, but back then not that many really knew her (despite her breakout performance in the Mask). But it's not her movie, it's an ensemble picture. And everyone in it is really good. The movie is very talk-y and you might not like that. But it does dig deep into human psyche. And while it is very philosophical at the beginning, it gets almost primal towards the end. The good thing is, that you can decide if you want to enjoy the movie as wicked, dark comedy or really read between the lines and get all the stabs it takes (no pun intended) against humanity/society!

    This is a pretty amusing send up of self righteousness and political extremism on the small scale. Five liberal room mates -- Diaz, Eldard, Gish, Penner, and Vance -- at a university in Iowa share a full-course meal in their home with a young man who reveals himself to be an unashamed macho war monger. A fight breaks out and the guest easily overpowers the wimpy hosts but is stabbed in the back by one of them. The victim burps, falls to the floor and dies. For the most part, the instrument of the deliberate murders that follow is poisoned wine. Let me recount the names of some of the right-wing victims: Bill Paxton is the dedicated warrior; Charles Durning as a minister who thinks queers deserve to die of AIDS; Mark Harmon as the ne plus ultra of male chauvinism; Jason Alexander as a man devoted to despoiling the earth; Pamela Gien as a librarian who thinks that "Catcher in the Rye" is pornographic. She doesn't drink so she has to be stabbed in the back. But this is the kind of comedy that doesn't need an excess of gore to be funny, so there is no gore at all. The ludic element lies elsewhere -- partly in occasionally clever but noetic unknowables. Example: If you were alone with Hitler in 1929, knowing what you now know, would you let him live? Partly the humor lies in ancillary themes. The Gang of Five decide to bury their first victim in the back yard, resulting in a suspicious-looking mound of earth. They put a tomato plant on top to disguise its contours. Eventually they have half a dozen huge tomato plants growing on the graves and there is a super-abundance of red ripe home-grown tomatoes. At first they can the tomatoes but the cabinets are finally filled. Then they slice them and hang them up to be sun dried. The tomatoes keep coming and getting bigger. They begin skeet shooting the tomatoes. They swing at them with baseball bats. Their last supper is spaghetti with marinara sauce. Another scene has Carmen Diaz planting pansies around the borders of the graves but it simply make the place look more like a cemetery than ever. (She gets PO'd when Vance rips them out.) And one of the roomies is a painter. He recreates, in a monstrous manner, Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel. On the dining room ceiling. (It should have been Da Vinci's "The Last Supper.") They run into trouble when they manage to persuade a rabble-rousing, right-wing TV maniac, Ron Perlman, to have a good meal at their home. During the dinner, before he is served the "dessert" wine, he cheerfully admits that he only rants on television because of the ratings, that in actuality he is full of crap. He thinks both extremes are dangerous and that centrists control government and always will. And if he met Hitler alone in 1929? No, he wouldn't kill Hitler. (The hosts reach for the "dessert" wine.) Instead, he would do his best to talk Hitler out of his designs. The connivers hesitate, then scurry outside for a discussion. Left alone in the dining room, the phony right-wing nut job lights a cigar and wanders around. He's about to pour a glass of the "dessert" wine but it smells funny to him. Then he picks up a local paper and reads an item about all the missing locals. The penny drops and he stares back at the bottle of poisoned wine. Lieutenant Columbo should have such intuition. It's all kind of amusing, so why isn't it funnier than it is? Great material, nice photography and lighting, and no clunk performances, but I kept thinking what Ealing Studios might have done with this plot in the mid-1950s. There would have been less extravagance in the performances for one thing. The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification. But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it. I still wish it had been made in the mid-50s by Ealing, but it's kind of fun, and welcome relief from most of the garbage showing up on the screen lately.

    This movie brings up a lot of major and provocative questions. It is not a work of film art, but it is a work of psychological art. The thoughts and questions that I find myself having are far more penetrating than the aesthetic questions that I have about this film. Advice: try to answer and address the questions posed by the film, and don't try to analyze this film as a piece of visual or film art. It will be more rewarding for you. This is a great film for two reasons: one, the film presents a lot of issues that I think intellectuals should try to answer, and two, it shows off the acting skills of a lot of young actors (at the time). I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to have some questions to mull over.

    One of the blackest comedies of the 1990s portrays a group of left-wing activists murdering right-wingers at dinner. Yes, very grim, but they know how to keep everything in good taste the whole time. Probably the funniest character in the movie is Ron Perlman as a Rush Limbaugh type on TV (he calls for a return to the Reagan era). Admittedly, "The Last Supper" isn't any kind of masterpiece. I guess that they could have improved it some by looking into how these various individuals on both sides of the political aisle arrived at their views. But otherwise, it sure pleased me. Some of the ill-fated conservative characters made my skin crawl. Also starring Cameron Diaz, Courtney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, Bill Paxton and Charles Durning.

    It's 1909 and you're alone with a young artist named Adolph. Do you kill him? A hypothetical question becomes real for a group of friends (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, and Courtney B. Vance) that inadvertently have a gung ho ex-Marine (Bill Paxton) for dinner. They decide that the world could be a better place if they removed some of those who pollute it with their thoughts, words, and actions. Come on, you've probably thought of the idea too. Wouldn't America be a better place if someone had gotten rid of a few right-wing nut-jobs before they could do serious damage to the country? They choose one each Sunday - anti-gay (Charles Durning), anti-literacy (Pamela Gien), anti-environment (Jason Alexander), etc. - you guessed it, until they come up with what they consider the ultimate prize - a Rush Limbaugh type (Ron Perlman) that causes them to pause. Is he really bad, or just out for money and publicity? Is that a bad enough reason to kill him? The answer and ending were a perfect ending to a funny movie.
