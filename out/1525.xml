    Contemporary society's focus on homosexuality takes an interesting twist in this 1998 movie. Basically, a pregnant Jennifer Aniston wishes to raise her baby with an endearing homosexual she has met. This movie doesn't stop there. The race question is also brought in when she meets a black police officer. Paul Rudd is excellent as the conflicted gay guy. He has feelings for the Aniston character, but his male preference ultimately prevails. The picture is a good one as everyone eventually comes to terms with their beliefs. In a brief appearance, Nigel Hawthorne shines as an elderly, realistic gay man. We're in the mix of the wealthy and not so wealthy people here. We have writers, educators and others confronting their homosexuality.

    Nina played by Jennifer Aniston invites a gay man (George) into her house to be her room mate, first sign her relationship with her bf (Vince) is going south is she doesn't invite him to move in. Nina soon falls pregnant and then decides to move in with Vince. However Nina gets frustrated when Vince makes some comments about trophys given in schools. I found the reaction or the script was just unbelievable. The character Nina is so shallow that she can not have a difference of opinion or respect other peoples opinions that she needs to react in a way as if Vince was abusing her. Nina then falls in love with George. The concept of a straight women falling in love with a gay man, the absurdity that she believes a relationship should work. Sure, some woman might be able to relate, but others with brain cells know and understand the stupidity of the concept. The film is a complete fantasy with little to none humour. I don't recall actually laughing once. Don't waste your time.

    Thought the story is light, it delivers entertainment and a good time. The casting is very spontaneous, the actors weren't that known back there but were good enough to act decently. The story is quite original, I have never seen other movie where the girl falls in love with a gay man. The plot would be better if these kind of people really existed; we know that in real life people are prejudiced, intolerant and fight for anything (specially we, men). In this film, people accept things very easily, men don't dispute women, parents have no problem in the daughter living with a homossexual and biological father has no problem with the "new dad". Those things create lots of fray in real life. So that's it; an original comedy not much funny, but satisfying enough to don't disappoint the viewer.

    Probably tells much about this film, when I say I have only seen a couple of better romantic comedies. The characters are portrayed excellently, the plot is great, everything works. The one thing that didn't work for me was the ending. As said earlier, the characters are great, and every one of the actors do a good job portraying their own; Jennifer Aniston pulls out one of her best performances, if not even the best. When ever I have seen Paul Rudd, he has pulled out a good effort, as is now. The side characters are interesting, yet aren't shown too much. This, along the fact that it makes you laugh at least a few times, has a couple of magnificent scenes, and so on, make it very worth a while experience, a memorable two hours or so to spend on a movie. I'd encourage everyone, everyone to give it a shot. 8.1/10

    Gay Robert Joeley (Tim Daley) more or less throws boyfriend George (Paul Rudd) out of the house. George moves in with str8 Nina (Jennifer Aniston). They get along great until Nina gets pregnant from boyfriend Vince (John Pankow). However she doesn't want to live with Vince--she wants George to live with her and bring up the baby. He initially agrees--but then Nina gets jealous if he tries to have a boyfriend! I saw this back in 1998 and had no idea if I liked it or not. Seeing it again I now know why--this is entertaining but simplistic and dumbed down. I'm no fan of the original novel but it was a lot grittier and concentrated more on George than the movie. But--Aniston was more well known than Rudd so this movie is now all about her and totally ignores any of the more interesting aspects of the novel and makes the characters more accessible. This is the kind of movie where a teacher and a social worker can easily afford a HUGE beautiful apartment in Brooklyn. Also it's suggested (in a truly horrendous scene) that Rudd COULD switch from guys to her. Speaking as a gay man I can tell you--it doesn't happen. You don't just switch back and forth. Still--for 1998--that's probably as far as a studio would go. Also a kiss between Rudd and another man was cut out so it wouldn't offend str8 audiences! (Although him and Amo Gulinello have a few cute little kisses). Still, if you can ignore that, it's OK. It has a good cast and acting helps. Aniston is very good in her role. Rudd is totally miscast as a gay man (I never believed him for one second) but he's not bad. Nigel Hawthorne and Gulinello are excellent as a gay couple. Daley is interesting (and hot) as George's ex. Alison Janney is just hysterical as Ansiton's sister. And it was fun to see Stephen Macht (The Spirit himself) in a bit as an ex of George! The movie looks good and has a nice music score too. So it's not even close to treating its subject seriously but it works as fluff. I give it a 7.

    Oh, Joy, joy......another film about a gay man who only needs the right woman to convert him. The scene in which Aniston's character SUCCEEDS in seducing Rudd's character is purposely geared to have the audience saying "See, I KNEW he didn't REALLY want to be gay. Now he'll be cured and they can live happily ever after!". The only thing that stops them actually having sex is A PHONE CALL! He doesn't stop it...it has to be a freaking phone call! What an epic cop-out! I'm sorry to burst your hetero female fantasy bubble, Ms. Wasserstein, but men who are actually gay DON'T.....even deep down....want to have sex with women....even if they're Jennifer Anniston. All the gay relationships in the film are depicted as horrible, shallow messes which further serves to egg the audience on in hoping that Rudd's character will be "converted" by Anniston's because he'd be so much happier with her if he could only see. That makes me so angry I could vomit! It makes no difference that he ends up with a guy at the end. The point of the script is that he COULD have been converted. This is homophobia, pure and simple and no less sickening than that to be found in a Klan meeting or a Baptist church. I....HATE....THIS....MOVIE!

    My guilty-pleasure enjoyment of Hollywood romantic comedies is just one of the things that ostracizes me from the rest of the populace. Because I know the type of person who quietly watches something like a Sandra Bullock movie and thinks about tying Denis Leary up so we can fully iron out the terms of our rocky relationship (if it wasn't rocky, it wouldn't be a "comedy" now would it?), and demanding security in his commitment before I continue with the wining and dining process, is not typically the same type of person who enjoys watching horror films for the love of art. That's me, flaws and all. I am a freak full of vigor, but darn it- I want total control. That's why this kind of movie makes me all noodle-like. I'm too wishy-washy (like that pioneer of discontent, Charlie Brown before me) to tell the world that this is not the way things should be. The lives Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd lead in this movie are the result of not having the guts to tell other people what they want. They still get what they want, which is the product of the Happy Ending disease of Hollywood cinema. But do I really have to sit and watch them talk and talk, without just coming out and saying: "this is what I want"? I hope that's not too cryptic. Anyway, the answer to that question is: yes. I have to sit and watch this talky movie. Not because it's a Hollywood film from a fairly homophobic studio about a gay man and his quest to become a father... with a woman having a straight man's baby. But because all the good-looking men in this movie are idiots. Except the young guy, Paul - played by the dreamy and very talented Amo Gulinello (who has since been completely buried in the cast list under a mountain of bit part players just because years later they did high-profile movies and shows). I have a theory about really good-looking men. I find almost all of them under the age of 25 only get attention for being very good looking, and then later can only combat becoming a complete moron if they are raised by really intelligent but also easy-going and honest parents. Not honest in the eyes of the world. Because, who cares what everyone else thinks? But honest in that they don't lie to or hold potentially vital information from their children. Jennifer Aniston's Nina is so flawed, her drama in the movie is barely worth discussing. Let me just say though that, while I'm sure every romantic comedy fan in the audience will shout: "you can do so much better than Vince!," meaning the character (not actor Vince Vaughn), I found John Pankow absolutely irresistible in the film. And that the type of guy he was playing was not given a fair chance to prove his sensitivity in the first 50 or so minutes of the movie. And why is that? Because Aniston could never tell him what she wanted. You may feel the urge to bring up the scene where she tells him that is his fault. But, I think it's her fault. I don't usually blame the woman, but in this movie I'm blaming George and Nina as a couple for the problems they encountered. Because together, they had the perfect excuse to never be honest. It would hurt the other's feelings. I'll bet that was the reason. Anyway, when watching would-be serious movies, I like to pick a character to identify with. In this movie, I wanted to be George. Not because I have ever cried thinking: "why can't I be a father" (thank God for that). But because I haven't had any luck in love and could easily see the attraction to a guy like Tim Daly's character. A pretty obvious manipulator. Other than intense good looks, he wouldn't keep his mouth shut about something even if he thought he'd swallow his shoe if he left it open. He's reliable and predictable. And God, that's what I want in a lover. I like surprises, but they also scare me. Again- I want total control. This kind of movie is not for people like me. But it is enough seeds to be able to make something grow out of it. As a piece of film-making, it's at least better crafted than a huge slew of modern Hollywood romantic movies. As formula, it's quite sloppy at times. But it mistakes its way into, I think, portraying George's new relationship with a younger guy with a sweet wild streak that makes me smile. It's not a movie that will challenge you to think much, but it won't hurt your face by making you frown too much either.

    I know this doesn't exactly sound like a rave review, my emotions regarding this film are kinda complex. The film certainly has its flaws, and while it hasn't aged as well as one might hope, the emotion behind the film is so genuine. It may be my own experiences, but I feel that this film has something to offer more than the obvious female and gay male audience. Jennifer Aniston is very likable as Nina, which is saying quite a bit for me because I tend to not go nuts over her. There are traces of her standard Rachel character, but she proves herself much more capable in this role. Paul Rudd does a great job as George, basing his character more on genuine human emotion than gay stereotypes. The emotional dynamic between these two is the central focus of the film and is written extremely well. All in all, this film definitely has its flaws, but its genuine emotional core make it worth checking out.

    That is the question that Nina have when she falls in love of a gay kindergarten teacher, George. If this is not a kind of romantic that you usually used to hear in an almost XXI century, now is so much different. In the same year comes "Will & Grace" and then "The Next Best Thing". Now, the relationship between gay man and straight woman is yet a typical formula of romantic Hollywood comedies (I guess that not always this characters live together, but always the lead female character has a gay friend, and a gay has to best friend to a single woman). If "The Object of my Affection" don't start it all, is (In movies, because "Will & Grace" is a great and very funny T.V show) the best of all films of this kind of plot - or better the best that i have seen-. In our lives, always we find special people that full us. That makes us feel so different, in a good -very good- way. But, in spite, this person is not always the suitable one. And, in spite that we know that, we suffer of this person. "The Object of my Affection" is the portrait of this kind of uncontrollable suffer by the heart of human beens, show it to us by the story of Nina, who met George, who broke up with his boyfriend. Nina, who see how sad is George for some of the problems that this broke up begins, decides to offer him to stay with her until he be stabilized. Nina lives with other man. She is pregnant of him. After a while, Nina begins a strong relationship with George. The Nina begins to fall in loved of him... Wow, what problem going to begin! "The Object of my Affection" is a drama that, when you watch at the beginning like another romantic comedy which is all the opposite. "The Object of my Affection" is a tender drama that analyzed a hard topic, but that is inevitable in our lives: Love. The movie counts with great performances too: Jennifer Aniston (Shines like ever as Nina), Paul Rudd as George, Timothy Daly, Amo Gulinello, Alan Alda and Allison Janney. Of course that are a lot of movies about unrequited love (Look for one the best movies of this topic "My Own Private Idaho") but the bitter way, dressed of colorful, of "The Object of my Affection" is unique. The story is not a "chick flick" although that much thinks that. This movie is a contemporaneous drama which is fill of an optimistic voice, since the begin to the end. "The Object of my Affection" is great movie that keeps in mind of much - or only me, if is the case-, and marks the thing that "Will & Grace" makes with so greatness and that "The Next Best Thing" ruins. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.

    In order for me to get properly engaged in a movie, I have to relate to most of the major players. As such, I tend to shy away from gay-themed movies, because I just can't relate to the characters and their situations. This movie is different. I found all of the characters to be extremely well-written. There was a lot of depth-of-character in all of the parts, both major and minor ones. This movie stayed away from clich&eacute;s and took a fresh look at the complexities of love and the expectations that we have about our relationships. Perhaps the best compliment is that I had no idea how this movie was going to end. That's rare in modern romance movies. The acting was exceptional as well. Paul Rudd seems to be taking shallow roles in shallow comedies like "Ron Burgundy" lately, but it's clear from this that he can engage in serious acting. I wasn't terribly impressed with Jennifer Anniston's acting in "Friends", but it's clear from this film - and subsequent work - that she is capable of acting with considerable depth. I was quite surprised at the relatively low rating from the IMDb crowd. It is quite possible that is was marketed wrong. I watched this on HBO and it was billed as a romantic comedy. No way. This is a very dramatic movie, with some deeply sad and heartfelt moments. I recommend this movie very highly if you are interested in character-centered, movies with complex, expressive emotions.

I have a theory about really good-looking men. I find almost all of them under the age of 25 only get attention for being very good looking, and then later can only combat becoming a complete moron if they are raised by really intelligent but also easy-going and honest parents. Not honest in the eyes of the world. Because, who cares what everyone else thinks? But honest in that they don't lie to or hold potentially vital information from their children. Jennifer Aniston's Nina is so flawed, her drama in the movie is barely worth discussing. Let me just say though that, while I'm sure every romantic comedy fan in the audience will shout: "you can do so much better than Vince!," meaning the character (not actor Vince Vaughn), I found John Pankow absolutely irresistible in the film. And that the type of guy he was playing was not given a fair chance to prove his sensitivity in the first 50 or so minutes of the movie. And why is that? Because Aniston could never tell him what she wanted. You may feel the urge to bring up the scene where she tells him that is his fault. But, I think it's her fault. I don't usually blame the woman, but in this movie I'm blaming George and Nina as a couple for the problems they encountered. Because together, they had the perfect excuse to never be honest. It would hurt the other's feelings. I'll bet that was the reason. Anyway, when watching would-be serious movies, I like to pick a character to identify with. In this movie, I wanted to be George. Not because I have ever cried thinking: "why can't I be a father" (thank God for that). But because I haven't had any luck in love and could easily see the attraction to a guy like Tim Daly's character. A pretty obvious manipulator. Other than intense good looks, he wouldn't keep his mouth shut about something even if he thought he'd swallow his shoe if he left it open. He's reliable and predictable. And God, that's what I want in a lover. I like surprises, but they also scare me. Again- I want total control. This kind of movie is not for people like me. But it is enough seeds to be able to make something grow out of it. As a piece of film-making, it's at least better crafted than a huge slew of modern Hollywood romantic movies. As formula, it's quite sloppy at times. But it mistakes its way into, I think, portraying George's new relationship with a younger guy with a sweet wild streak that makes me smile. It's not a movie that will challenge you to think much, but it won't hurt your face by making you frown too much either.

    I know this doesn't exactly sound like a rave review, my emotions regarding this film are kinda complex. The film certainly has its flaws, and while it hasn't aged as well as one might hope, the emotion behind the film is so genuine. It may be my own experiences, but I feel that this film has something to offer more than the obvious female and gay male audience. Jennifer Aniston is very likable as Nina, which is saying quite a bit for me because I tend to not go nuts over her. There are traces of her standard Rachel character, but she proves herself much more capable in this role. Paul Rudd does a great job as George, basing his character more on genuine human emotion than gay stereotypes. The emotional dynamic between these two is the central focus of the film and is written extremely well. All in all, this film definitely has its flaws, but its genuine emotional core make it worth checking out.

    That is the question that Nina have when she falls in love of a gay kindergarten teacher, George. If this is not a kind of romantic that you usually used to hear in an almost XXI century, now is so much different. In the same year comes "Will & Grace" and then "The Next Best Thing". Now, the relationship between gay man and straight woman is yet a typical formula of romantic Hollywood comedies (I guess that not always this characters live together, but always the lead female character has a gay friend, and a gay has to best friend to a single woman). If "The Object of my Affection" don't start it all, is (In movies, because "Will & Grace" is a great and very funny T.V show) the best of all films of this kind of plot - or better the best that i have seen-. In our lives, always we find special people that full us. That makes us feel so different, in a good -very good- way. But, in spite, this person is not always the suitable one. And, in spite that we know that, we suffer of this person. "The Object of my Affection" is the portrait of this kind of uncontrollable suffer by the heart of human beens, show it to us by the story of Nina, who met George, who broke up with his boyfriend. Nina, who see how sad is George for some of the problems that this broke up begins, decides to offer him to stay with her until he be stabilized. Nina lives with other man. She is pregnant of him. After a while, Nina begins a strong relationship with George. The Nina begins to fall in loved of him... Wow, what problem going to begin! "The Object of my Affection" is a drama that, when you watch at the beginning like another romantic comedy which is all the opposite. "The Object of my Affection" is a tender drama that analyzed a hard topic, but that is inevitable in our lives: Love. The movie counts with great performances too: Jennifer Aniston (Shines like ever as Nina), Paul Rudd as George, Timothy Daly, Amo Gulinello, Alan Alda and Allison Janney. Of course that are a lot of movies about unrequited love (Look for one the best movies of this topic "My Own Private Idaho") but the bitter way, dressed of colorful, of "The Object of my Affection" is unique. The story is not a "chick flick" although that much thinks that. This movie is a contemporaneous drama which is fill of an optimistic voice, since the begin to the end. "The Object of my Affection" is great movie that keeps in mind of much - or only me, if is the case-, and marks the thing that "Will & Grace" makes with so greatness and that "The Next Best Thing" ruins. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.

    In order for me to get properly engaged in a movie, I have to relate to most of the major players. As such, I tend to shy away from gay-themed movies, because I just can't relate to the characters and their situations. This movie is different. I found all of the characters to be extremely well-written. There was a lot of depth-of-character in all of the parts, both major and minor ones. This movie stayed away from clich&eacute;s and took a fresh look at the complexities of love and the expectations that we have about our relationships. Perhaps the best compliment is that I had no idea how this movie was going to end. That's rare in modern romance movies. The acting was exceptional as well. Paul Rudd seems to be taking shallow roles in shallow comedies like "Ron Burgundy" lately, but it's clear from this that he can engage in serious acting. I wasn't terribly impressed with Jennifer Anniston's acting in "Friends", but it's clear from this film - and subsequent work - that she is capable of acting with considerable depth. I was quite surprised at the relatively low rating from the IMDb crowd. It is quite possible that is was marketed wrong. I watched this on HBO and it was billed as a romantic comedy. No way. This is a very dramatic movie, with some deeply sad and heartfelt moments. I recommend this movie very highly if you are interested in character-centered, movies with complex, expressive emotions.

    Contemporary society's focus on homosexuality takes an interesting twist in this 1998 movie. Basically, a pregnant Jennifer Aniston wishes to raise her baby with an endearing homosexual she has met. This movie doesn't stop there. The race question is also brought in when she meets a black police officer. Paul Rudd is excellent as the conflicted gay guy. He has feelings for the Aniston character, but his male preference ultimately prevails. The picture is a good one as everyone eventually comes to terms with their beliefs. In a brief appearance, Nigel Hawthorne shines as an elderly, realistic gay man. We're in the mix of the wealthy and not so wealthy people here. We have writers, educators and others confronting their homosexuality.

    Nina played by Jennifer Aniston invites a gay man (George) into her house to be her room mate, first sign her relationship with her bf (Vince) is going south is she doesn't invite him to move in. Nina soon falls pregnant and then decides to move in with Vince. However Nina gets frustrated when Vince makes some comments about trophys given in schools. I found the reaction or the script was just unbelievable. The character Nina is so shallow that she can not have a difference of opinion or respect other peoples opinions that she needs to react in a way as if Vince was abusing her. Nina then falls in love with George. The concept of a straight women falling in love with a gay man, the absurdity that she believes a relationship should work. Sure, some woman might be able to relate, but others with brain cells know and understand the stupidity of the concept. The film is a complete fantasy with little to none humour. I don't recall actually laughing once. Don't waste your time.

    Thought the story is light, it delivers entertainment and a good time. The casting is very spontaneous, the actors weren't that known back there but were good enough to act decently. The story is quite original, I have never seen other movie where the girl falls in love with a gay man. The plot would be better if these kind of people really existed; we know that in real life people are prejudiced, intolerant and fight for anything (specially we, men). In this film, people accept things very easily, men don't dispute women, parents have no problem in the daughter living with a homossexual and biological father has no problem with the "new dad". Those things create lots of fray in real life. So that's it; an original comedy not much funny, but satisfying enough to don't disappoint the viewer.

    Probably tells much about this film, when I say I have only seen a couple of better romantic comedies. The characters are portrayed excellently, the plot is great, everything works. The one thing that didn't work for me was the ending. As said earlier, the characters are great, and every one of the actors do a good job portraying their own; Jennifer Aniston pulls out one of her best performances, if not even the best. When ever I have seen Paul Rudd, he has pulled out a good effort, as is now. The side characters are interesting, yet aren't shown too much. This, along the fact that it makes you laugh at least a few times, has a couple of magnificent scenes, and so on, make it very worth a while experience, a memorable two hours or so to spend on a movie. I'd encourage everyone, everyone to give it a shot. 8.1/10

    Gay Robert Joeley (Tim Daley) more or less throws boyfriend George (Paul Rudd) out of the house. George moves in with str8 Nina (Jennifer Aniston). They get along great until Nina gets pregnant from boyfriend Vince (John Pankow). However she doesn't want to live with Vince--she wants George to live with her and bring up the baby. He initially agrees--but then Nina gets jealous if he tries to have a boyfriend! I saw this back in 1998 and had no idea if I liked it or not. Seeing it again I now know why--this is entertaining but simplistic and dumbed down. I'm no fan of the original novel but it was a lot grittier and concentrated more on George than the movie. But--Aniston was more well known than Rudd so this movie is now all about her and totally ignores any of the more interesting aspects of the novel and makes the characters more accessible. This is the kind of movie where a teacher and a social worker can easily afford a HUGE beautiful apartment in Brooklyn. Also it's suggested (in a truly horrendous scene) that Rudd COULD switch from guys to her. Speaking as a gay man I can tell you--it doesn't happen. You don't just switch back and forth. Still--for 1998--that's probably as far as a studio would go. Also a kiss between Rudd and another man was cut out so it wouldn't offend str8 audiences! (Although him and Amo Gulinello have a few cute little kisses). Still, if you can ignore that, it's OK. It has a good cast and acting helps. Aniston is very good in her role. Rudd is totally miscast as a gay man (I never believed him for one second) but he's not bad. Nigel Hawthorne and Gulinello are excellent as a gay couple. Daley is interesting (and hot) as George's ex. Alison Janney is just hysterical as Ansiton's sister. And it was fun to see Stephen Macht (The Spirit himself) in a bit as an ex of George! The movie looks good and has a nice music score too. So it's not even close to treating its subject seriously but it works as fluff. I give it a 7.

    Oh, Joy, joy......another film about a gay man who only needs the right woman to convert him. The scene in which Aniston's character SUCCEEDS in seducing Rudd's character is purposely geared to have the audience saying "See, I KNEW he didn't REALLY want to be gay. Now he'll be cured and they can live happily ever after!". The only thing that stops them actually having sex is A PHONE CALL! He doesn't stop it...it has to be a freaking phone call! What an epic cop-out! I'm sorry to burst your hetero female fantasy bubble, Ms. Wasserstein, but men who are actually gay DON'T.....even deep down....want to have sex with women....even if they're Jennifer Anniston. All the gay relationships in the film are depicted as horrible, shallow messes which further serves to egg the audience on in hoping that Rudd's character will be "converted" by Anniston's because he'd be so much happier with her if he could only see. That makes me so angry I could vomit! It makes no difference that he ends up with a guy at the end. The point of the script is that he COULD have been converted. This is homophobia, pure and simple and no less sickening than that to be found in a Klan meeting or a Baptist church. I....HATE....THIS....MOVIE!

    My guilty-pleasure enjoyment of Hollywood romantic comedies is just one of the things that ostracizes me from the rest of the populace. Because I know the type of person who quietly watches something like a Sandra Bullock movie and thinks about tying Denis Leary up so we can fully iron out the terms of our rocky relationship (if it wasn't rocky, it wouldn't be a "comedy" now would it?), and demanding security in his commitment before I continue with the wining and dining process, is not typically the same type of person who enjoys watching horror films for the love of art. That's me, flaws and all. I am a freak full of vigor, but darn it- I want total control. That's why this kind of movie makes me all noodle-like. I'm too wishy-washy (like that pioneer of discontent, Charlie Brown before me) to tell the world that this is not the way things should be. The lives Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd lead in this movie are the result of not having the guts to tell other people what they want. They still get what they want, which is the product of the Happy Ending disease of Hollywood cinema. But do I really have to sit and watch them talk and talk, without just coming out and saying: "this is what I want"? I hope that's not too cryptic. Anyway, the answer to that question is: yes. I have to sit and watch this talky movie. Not because it's a Hollywood film from a fairly homophobic studio about a gay man and his quest to become a father... with a woman having a straight man's baby. But because all the good-looking men in this movie are idiots. Except the young guy, Paul - played by the dreamy and very talented Amo Gulinello (who has since been completely buried in the cast list under a mountain of bit part players just because years later they did high-profile movies and shows). I have a theory about really good-looking men. I find almost all of them under the age of 25 only get attention for being very good looking, and then later can only combat becoming a complete moron if they are raised by really intelligent but also easy-going and honest parents.

I'd encourage everyone, everyone to give it a shot. 8.1/10

    Gay Robert Joeley (Tim Daley) more or less throws boyfriend George (Paul Rudd) out of the house. George moves in with str8 Nina (Jennifer Aniston). They get along great until Nina gets pregnant from boyfriend Vince (John Pankow). However she doesn't want to live with Vince--she wants George to live with her and bring up the baby. He initially agrees--but then Nina gets jealous if he tries to have a boyfriend! I saw this back in 1998 and had no idea if I liked it or not. Seeing it again I now know why--this is entertaining but simplistic and dumbed down. I'm no fan of the original novel but it was a lot grittier and concentrated more on George than the movie. But--Aniston was more well known than Rudd so this movie is now all about her and totally ignores any of the more interesting aspects of the novel and makes the characters more accessible. This is the kind of movie where a teacher and a social worker can easily afford a HUGE beautiful apartment in Brooklyn. Also it's suggested (in a truly horrendous scene) that Rudd COULD switch from guys to her. Speaking as a gay man I can tell you--it doesn't happen. You don't just switch back and forth. Still--for 1998--that's probably as far as a studio would go. Also a kiss between Rudd and another man was cut out so it wouldn't offend str8 audiences! (Although him and Amo Gulinello have a few cute little kisses). Still, if you can ignore that, it's OK. It has a good cast and acting helps. Aniston is very good in her role. Rudd is totally miscast as a gay man (I never believed him for one second) but he's not bad. Nigel Hawthorne and Gulinello are excellent as a gay couple. Daley is interesting (and hot) as George's ex. Alison Janney is just hysterical as Ansiton's sister. And it was fun to see Stephen Macht (The Spirit himself) in a bit as an ex of George! The movie looks good and has a nice music score too. So it's not even close to treating its subject seriously but it works as fluff. I give it a 7.

    Oh, Joy, joy......another film about a gay man who only needs the right woman to convert him. The scene in which Aniston's character SUCCEEDS in seducing Rudd's character is purposely geared to have the audience saying "See, I KNEW he didn't REALLY want to be gay. Now he'll be cured and they can live happily ever after!". The only thing that stops them actually having sex is A PHONE CALL! He doesn't stop it...it has to be a freaking phone call! What an epic cop-out! I'm sorry to burst your hetero female fantasy bubble, Ms. Wasserstein, but men who are actually gay DON'T.....even deep down....want to have sex with women....even if they're Jennifer Anniston. All the gay relationships in the film are depicted as horrible, shallow messes which further serves to egg the audience on in hoping that Rudd's character will be "converted" by Anniston's because he'd be so much happier with her if he could only see. That makes me so angry I could vomit! It makes no difference that he ends up with a guy at the end. The point of the script is that he COULD have been converted. This is homophobia, pure and simple and no less sickening than that to be found in a Klan meeting or a Baptist church. I....HATE....THIS....MOVIE!

    My guilty-pleasure enjoyment of Hollywood romantic comedies is just one of the things that ostracizes me from the rest of the populace. Because I know the type of person who quietly watches something like a Sandra Bullock movie and thinks about tying Denis Leary up so we can fully iron out the terms of our rocky relationship (if it wasn't rocky, it wouldn't be a "comedy" now would it?), and demanding security in his commitment before I continue with the wining and dining process, is not typically the same type of person who enjoys watching horror films for the love of art. That's me, flaws and all. I am a freak full of vigor, but darn it- I want total control. That's why this kind of movie makes me all noodle-like. I'm too wishy-washy (like that pioneer of discontent, Charlie Brown before me) to tell the world that this is not the way things should be. The lives Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd lead in this movie are the result of not having the guts to tell other people what they want. They still get what they want, which is the product of the Happy Ending disease of Hollywood cinema. But do I really have to sit and watch them talk and talk, without just coming out and saying: "this is what I want"? I hope that's not too cryptic. Anyway, the answer to that question is: yes. I have to sit and watch this talky movie. Not because it's a Hollywood film from a fairly homophobic studio about a gay man and his quest to become a father... with a woman having a straight man's baby. But because all the good-looking men in this movie are idiots. Except the young guy, Paul - played by the dreamy and very talented Amo Gulinello (who has since been completely buried in the cast list under a mountain of bit part players just because years later they did high-profile movies and shows). I have a theory about really good-looking men. I find almost all of them under the age of 25 only get attention for being very good looking, and then later can only combat becoming a complete moron if they are raised by really intelligent but also easy-going and honest parents. Not honest in the eyes of the world. Because, who cares what everyone else thinks? But honest in that they don't lie to or hold potentially vital information from their children. Jennifer Aniston's Nina is so flawed, her drama in the movie is barely worth discussing. Let me just say though that, while I'm sure every romantic comedy fan in the audience will shout: "you can do so much better than Vince!," meaning the character (not actor Vince Vaughn), I found John Pankow absolutely irresistible in the film. And that the type of guy he was playing was not given a fair chance to prove his sensitivity in the first 50 or so minutes of the movie. And why is that? Because Aniston could never tell him what she wanted. You may feel the urge to bring up the scene where she tells him that is his fault. But, I think it's her fault. I don't usually blame the woman, but in this movie I'm blaming George and Nina as a couple for the problems they encountered. Because together, they had the perfect excuse to never be honest. It would hurt the other's feelings. I'll bet that was the reason. Anyway, when watching would-be serious movies, I like to pick a character to identify with. In this movie, I wanted to be George. Not because I have ever cried thinking: "why can't I be a father" (thank God for that). But because I haven't had any luck in love and could easily see the attraction to a guy like Tim Daly's character. A pretty obvious manipulator. Other than intense good looks, he wouldn't keep his mouth shut about something even if he thought he'd swallow his shoe if he left it open. He's reliable and predictable. And God, that's what I want in a lover. I like surprises, but they also scare me. Again- I want total control. This kind of movie is not for people like me. But it is enough seeds to be able to make something grow out of it. As a piece of film-making, it's at least better crafted than a huge slew of modern Hollywood romantic movies. As formula, it's quite sloppy at times. But it mistakes its way into, I think, portraying George's new relationship with a younger guy with a sweet wild streak that makes me smile. It's not a movie that will challenge you to think much, but it won't hurt your face by making you frown too much either.

    I know this doesn't exactly sound like a rave review, my emotions regarding this film are kinda complex. The film certainly has its flaws, and while it hasn't aged as well as one might hope, the emotion behind the film is so genuine. It may be my own experiences, but I feel that this film has something to offer more than the obvious female and gay male audience. Jennifer Aniston is very likable as Nina, which is saying quite a bit for me because I tend to not go nuts over her. There are traces of her standard Rachel character, but she proves herself much more capable in this role. Paul Rudd does a great job as George, basing his character more on genuine human emotion than gay stereotypes. The emotional dynamic between these two is the central focus of the film and is written extremely well. All in all, this film definitely has its flaws, but its genuine emotional core make it worth checking out.

    That is the question that Nina have when she falls in love of a gay kindergarten teacher, George. If this is not a kind of romantic that you usually used to hear in an almost XXI century, now is so much different. In the same year comes "Will & Grace" and then "The Next Best Thing". Now, the relationship between gay man and straight woman is yet a typical formula of romantic Hollywood comedies (I guess that not always this characters live together, but always the lead female character has a gay friend, and a gay has to best friend to a single woman). If "The Object of my Affection" don't start it all, is (In movies, because "Will & Grace" is a great and very funny T.V show) the best of all films of this kind of plot - or better the best that i have seen-. In our lives, always we find special people that full us. That makes us feel so different, in a good -very good- way. But, in spite, this person is not always the suitable one. And, in spite that we know that, we suffer of this person. "The Object of my Affection" is the portrait of this kind of uncontrollable suffer by the heart of human beens, show it to us by the story of Nina, who met George, who broke up with his boyfriend. Nina, who see how sad is George for some of the problems that this broke up begins, decides to offer him to stay with her until he be stabilized. Nina lives with other man. She is pregnant of him. After a while, Nina begins a strong relationship with George. The Nina begins to fall in loved of him... Wow, what problem going to begin! "The Object of my Affection" is a drama that, when you watch at the beginning like another romantic comedy which is all the opposite. "The Object of my Affection" is a tender drama that analyzed a hard topic, but that is inevitable in our lives: Love. The movie counts with great performances too: Jennifer Aniston (Shines like ever as Nina), Paul Rudd as George, Timothy Daly, Amo Gulinello, Alan Alda and Allison Janney. Of course that are a lot of movies about unrequited love (Look for one the best movies of this topic "My Own Private Idaho") but the bitter way, dressed of colorful, of "The Object of my Affection" is unique. The story is not a "chick flick" although that much thinks that. This movie is a contemporaneous drama which is fill of an optimistic voice, since the begin to the end. "The Object of my Affection" is great movie that keeps in mind of much - or only me, if is the case-, and marks the thing that "Will & Grace" makes with so greatness and that "The Next Best Thing" ruins. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.

    In order for me to get properly engaged in a movie, I have to relate to most of the major players. As such, I tend to shy away from gay-themed movies, because I just can't relate to the characters and their situations. This movie is different. I found all of the characters to be extremely well-written. There was a lot of depth-of-character in all of the parts, both major and minor ones. This movie stayed away from clich&eacute;s and took a fresh look at the complexities of love and the expectations that we have about our relationships. Perhaps the best compliment is that I had no idea how this movie was going to end. That's rare in modern romance movies. The acting was exceptional as well. Paul Rudd seems to be taking shallow roles in shallow comedies like "Ron Burgundy" lately, but it's clear from this that he can engage in serious acting. I wasn't terribly impressed with Jennifer Anniston's acting in "Friends", but it's clear from this film - and subsequent work - that she is capable of acting with considerable depth. I was quite surprised at the relatively low rating from the IMDb crowd. It is quite possible that is was marketed wrong. I watched this on HBO and it was billed as a romantic comedy. No way. This is a very dramatic movie, with some deeply sad and heartfelt moments. I recommend this movie very highly if you are interested in character-centered, movies with complex, expressive emotions.

    Contemporary society's focus on homosexuality takes an interesting twist in this 1998 movie. Basically, a pregnant Jennifer Aniston wishes to raise her baby with an endearing homosexual she has met. This movie doesn't stop there. The race question is also brought in when she meets a black police officer. Paul Rudd is excellent as the conflicted gay guy. He has feelings for the Aniston character, but his male preference ultimately prevails. The picture is a good one as everyone eventually comes to terms with their beliefs. In a brief appearance, Nigel Hawthorne shines as an elderly, realistic gay man. We're in the mix of the wealthy and not so wealthy people here. We have writers, educators and others confronting their homosexuality.

    Nina played by Jennifer Aniston invites a gay man (George) into her house to be her room mate, first sign her relationship with her bf (Vince) is going south is she doesn't invite him to move in. Nina soon falls pregnant and then decides to move in with Vince. However Nina gets frustrated when Vince makes some comments about trophys given in schools. I found the reaction or the script was just unbelievable. The character Nina is so shallow that she can not have a difference of opinion or respect other peoples opinions that she needs to react in a way as if Vince was abusing her. Nina then falls in love with George. The concept of a straight women falling in love with a gay man, the absurdity that she believes a relationship should work. Sure, some woman might be able to relate, but others with brain cells know and understand the stupidity of the concept. The film is a complete fantasy with little to none humour. I don't recall actually laughing once. Don't waste your time.

    Thought the story is light, it delivers entertainment and a good time. The casting is very spontaneous, the actors weren't that known back there but were good enough to act decently. The story is quite original, I have never seen other movie where the girl falls in love with a gay man. The plot would be better if these kind of people really existed; we know that in real life people are prejudiced, intolerant and fight for anything (specially we, men). In this film, people accept things very easily, men don't dispute women, parents have no problem in the daughter living with a homossexual and biological father has no problem with the "new dad". Those things create lots of fray in real life. So that's it; an original comedy not much funny, but satisfying enough to don't disappoint the viewer.

    Probably tells much about this film, when I say I have only seen a couple of better romantic comedies. The characters are portrayed excellently, the plot is great, everything works. The one thing that didn't work for me was the ending. As said earlier, the characters are great, and every one of the actors do a good job portraying their own; Jennifer Aniston pulls out one of her best performances, if not even the best. When ever I have seen Paul Rudd, he has pulled out a good effort, as is now. The side characters are interesting, yet aren't shown too much. This, along the fact that it makes you laugh at least a few times, has a couple of magnificent scenes, and so on, make it very worth a while experience, a memorable two hours or so to spend on a movie.

    In order for me to get properly engaged in a movie, I have to relate to most of the major players. As such, I tend to shy away from gay-themed movies, because I just can't relate to the characters and their situations. This movie is different. I found all of the characters to be extremely well-written. There was a lot of depth-of-character in all of the parts, both major and minor ones. This movie stayed away from clich&eacute;s and took a fresh look at the complexities of love and the expectations that we have about our relationships. Perhaps the best compliment is that I had no idea how this movie was going to end. That's rare in modern romance movies. The acting was exceptional as well. Paul Rudd seems to be taking shallow roles in shallow comedies like "Ron Burgundy" lately, but it's clear from this that he can engage in serious acting. I wasn't terribly impressed with Jennifer Anniston's acting in "Friends", but it's clear from this film - and subsequent work - that she is capable of acting with considerable depth. I was quite surprised at the relatively low rating from the IMDb crowd. It is quite possible that is was marketed wrong. I watched this on HBO and it was billed as a romantic comedy. No way. This is a very dramatic movie, with some deeply sad and heartfelt moments. I recommend this movie very highly if you are interested in character-centered, movies with complex, expressive emotions.

    Contemporary society's focus on homosexuality takes an interesting twist in this 1998 movie. Basically, a pregnant Jennifer Aniston wishes to raise her baby with an endearing homosexual she has met. This movie doesn't stop there. The race question is also brought in when she meets a black police officer. Paul Rudd is excellent as the conflicted gay guy. He has feelings for the Aniston character, but his male preference ultimately prevails. The picture is a good one as everyone eventually comes to terms with their beliefs. In a brief appearance, Nigel Hawthorne shines as an elderly, realistic gay man. We're in the mix of the wealthy and not so wealthy people here. We have writers, educators and others confronting their homosexuality.

    Nina played by Jennifer Aniston invites a gay man (George) into her house to be her room mate, first sign her relationship with her bf (Vince) is going south is she doesn't invite him to move in. Nina soon falls pregnant and then decides to move in with Vince. However Nina gets frustrated when Vince makes some comments about trophys given in schools. I found the reaction or the script was just unbelievable. The character Nina is so shallow that she can not have a difference of opinion or respect other peoples opinions that she needs to react in a way as if Vince was abusing her. Nina then falls in love with George. The concept of a straight women falling in love with a gay man, the absurdity that she believes a relationship should work. Sure, some woman might be able to relate, but others with brain cells know and understand the stupidity of the concept. The film is a complete fantasy with little to none humour. I don't recall actually laughing once. Don't waste your time.

    Thought the story is light, it delivers entertainment and a good time. The casting is very spontaneous, the actors weren't that known back there but were good enough to act decently. The story is quite original, I have never seen other movie where the girl falls in love with a gay man. The plot would be better if these kind of people really existed; we know that in real life people are prejudiced, intolerant and fight for anything (specially we, men). In this film, people accept things very easily, men don't dispute women, parents have no problem in the daughter living with a homossexual and biological father has no problem with the "new dad". Those things create lots of fray in real life. So that's it; an original comedy not much funny, but satisfying enough to don't disappoint the viewer.

    Probably tells much about this film, when I say I have only seen a couple of better romantic comedies. The characters are portrayed excellently, the plot is great, everything works. The one thing that didn't work for me was the ending. As said earlier, the characters are great, and every one of the actors do a good job portraying their own; Jennifer Aniston pulls out one of her best performances, if not even the best. When ever I have seen Paul Rudd, he has pulled out a good effort, as is now. The side characters are interesting, yet aren't shown too much. This, along the fact that it makes you laugh at least a few times, has a couple of magnificent scenes, and so on, make it very worth a while experience, a memorable two hours or so to spend on a movie. I'd encourage everyone, everyone to give it a shot. 8.1/10

    Gay Robert Joeley (Tim Daley) more or less throws boyfriend George (Paul Rudd) out of the house. George moves in with str8 Nina (Jennifer Aniston). They get along great until Nina gets pregnant from boyfriend Vince (John Pankow). However she doesn't want to live with Vince--she wants George to live with her and bring up the baby. He initially agrees--but then Nina gets jealous if he tries to have a boyfriend! I saw this back in 1998 and had no idea if I liked it or not. Seeing it again I now know why--this is entertaining but simplistic and dumbed down. I'm no fan of the original novel but it was a lot grittier and concentrated more on George than the movie. But--Aniston was more well known than Rudd so this movie is now all about her and totally ignores any of the more interesting aspects of the novel and makes the characters more accessible. This is the kind of movie where a teacher and a social worker can easily afford a HUGE beautiful apartment in Brooklyn. Also it's suggested (in a truly horrendous scene) that Rudd COULD switch from guys to her. Speaking as a gay man I can tell you--it doesn't happen. You don't just switch back and forth. Still--for 1998--that's probably as far as a studio would go. Also a kiss between Rudd and another man was cut out so it wouldn't offend str8 audiences! (Although him and Amo Gulinello have a few cute little kisses). Still, if you can ignore that, it's OK. It has a good cast and acting helps. Aniston is very good in her role. Rudd is totally miscast as a gay man (I never believed him for one second) but he's not bad. Nigel Hawthorne and Gulinello are excellent as a gay couple. Daley is interesting (and hot) as George's ex. Alison Janney is just hysterical as Ansiton's sister. And it was fun to see Stephen Macht (The Spirit himself) in a bit as an ex of George! The movie looks good and has a nice music score too. So it's not even close to treating its subject seriously but it works as fluff. I give it a 7.

    Oh, Joy, joy......another film about a gay man who only needs the right woman to convert him. The scene in which Aniston's character SUCCEEDS in seducing Rudd's character is purposely geared to have the audience saying "See, I KNEW he didn't REALLY want to be gay. Now he'll be cured and they can live happily ever after!". The only thing that stops them actually having sex is A PHONE CALL! He doesn't stop it...it has to be a freaking phone call! What an epic cop-out! I'm sorry to burst your hetero female fantasy bubble, Ms. Wasserstein, but men who are actually gay DON'T.....even deep down....want to have sex with women....even if they're Jennifer Anniston. All the gay relationships in the film are depicted as horrible, shallow messes which further serves to egg the audience on in hoping that Rudd's character will be "converted" by Anniston's because he'd be so much happier with her if he could only see. That makes me so angry I could vomit! It makes no difference that he ends up with a guy at the end. The point of the script is that he COULD have been converted. This is homophobia, pure and simple and no less sickening than that to be found in a Klan meeting or a Baptist church. I....HATE....THIS....MOVIE!

    My guilty-pleasure enjoyment of Hollywood romantic comedies is just one of the things that ostracizes me from the rest of the populace. Because I know the type of person who quietly watches something like a Sandra Bullock movie and thinks about tying Denis Leary up so we can fully iron out the terms of our rocky relationship (if it wasn't rocky, it wouldn't be a "comedy" now would it?), and demanding security in his commitment before I continue with the wining and dining process, is not typically the same type of person who enjoys watching horror films for the love of art. That's me, flaws and all. I am a freak full of vigor, but darn it- I want total control. That's why this kind of movie makes me all noodle-like. I'm too wishy-washy (like that pioneer of discontent, Charlie Brown before me) to tell the world that this is not the way things should be. The lives Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd lead in this movie are the result of not having the guts to tell other people what they want. They still get what they want, which is the product of the Happy Ending disease of Hollywood cinema. But do I really have to sit and watch them talk and talk, without just coming out and saying: "this is what I want"? I hope that's not too cryptic. Anyway, the answer to that question is: yes. I have to sit and watch this talky movie. Not because it's a Hollywood film from a fairly homophobic studio about a gay man and his quest to become a father... with a woman having a straight man's baby. But because all the good-looking men in this movie are idiots. Except the young guy, Paul - played by the dreamy and very talented Amo Gulinello (who has since been completely buried in the cast list under a mountain of bit part players just because years later they did high-profile movies and shows). I have a theory about really good-looking men. I find almost all of them under the age of 25 only get attention for being very good looking, and then later can only combat becoming a complete moron if they are raised by really intelligent but also easy-going and honest parents. Not honest in the eyes of the world. Because, who cares what everyone else thinks? But honest in that they don't lie to or hold potentially vital information from their children. Jennifer Aniston's Nina is so flawed, her drama in the movie is barely worth discussing. Let me just say though that, while I'm sure every romantic comedy fan in the audience will shout: "you can do so much better than Vince!," meaning the character (not actor Vince Vaughn), I found John Pankow absolutely irresistible in the film. And that the type of guy he was playing was not given a fair chance to prove his sensitivity in the first 50 or so minutes of the movie. And why is that? Because Aniston could never tell him what she wanted. You may feel the urge to bring up the scene where she tells him that is his fault. But, I think it's her fault. I don't usually blame the woman, but in this movie I'm blaming George and Nina as a couple for the problems they encountered. Because together, they had the perfect excuse to never be honest. It would hurt the other's feelings. I'll bet that was the reason. Anyway, when watching would-be serious movies, I like to pick a character to identify with. In this movie, I wanted to be George. Not because I have ever cried thinking: "why can't I be a father" (thank God for that). But because I haven't had any luck in love and could easily see the attraction to a guy like Tim Daly's character. A pretty obvious manipulator. Other than intense good looks, he wouldn't keep his mouth shut about something even if he thought he'd swallow his shoe if he left it open. He's reliable and predictable. And God, that's what I want in a lover. I like surprises, but they also scare me. Again- I want total control. This kind of movie is not for people like me. But it is enough seeds to be able to make something grow out of it. As a piece of film-making, it's at least better crafted than a huge slew of modern Hollywood romantic movies. As formula, it's quite sloppy at times. But it mistakes its way into, I think, portraying George's new relationship with a younger guy with a sweet wild streak that makes me smile. It's not a movie that will challenge you to think much, but it won't hurt your face by making you frown too much either.

    I know this doesn't exactly sound like a rave review, my emotions regarding this film are kinda complex. The film certainly has its flaws, and while it hasn't aged as well as one might hope, the emotion behind the film is so genuine. It may be my own experiences, but I feel that this film has something to offer more than the obvious female and gay male audience. Jennifer Aniston is very likable as Nina, which is saying quite a bit for me because I tend to not go nuts over her. There are traces of her standard Rachel character, but she proves herself much more capable in this role. Paul Rudd does a great job as George, basing his character more on genuine human emotion than gay stereotypes. The emotional dynamic between these two is the central focus of the film and is written extremely well. All in all, this film definitely has its flaws, but its genuine emotional core make it worth checking out.

    That is the question that Nina have when she falls in love of a gay kindergarten teacher, George. If this is not a kind of romantic that you usually used to hear in an almost XXI century, now is so much different. In the same year comes "Will & Grace" and then "The Next Best Thing". Now, the relationship between gay man and straight woman is yet a typical formula of romantic Hollywood comedies (I guess that not always this characters live together, but always the lead female character has a gay friend, and a gay has to best friend to a single woman). If "The Object of my Affection" don't start it all, is (In movies, because "Will & Grace" is a great and very funny T.V show) the best of all films of this kind of plot - or better the best that i have seen-. In our lives, always we find special people that full us. That makes us feel so different, in a good -very good- way. But, in spite, this person is not always the suitable one. And, in spite that we know that, we suffer of this person. "The Object of my Affection" is the portrait of this kind of uncontrollable suffer by the heart of human beens, show it to us by the story of Nina, who met George, who broke up with his boyfriend. Nina, who see how sad is George for some of the problems that this broke up begins, decides to offer him to stay with her until he be stabilized. Nina lives with other man. She is pregnant of him. After a while, Nina begins a strong relationship with George. The Nina begins to fall in loved of him... Wow, what problem going to begin! "The Object of my Affection" is a drama that, when you watch at the beginning like another romantic comedy which is all the opposite. "The Object of my Affection" is a tender drama that analyzed a hard topic, but that is inevitable in our lives: Love. The movie counts with great performances too: Jennifer Aniston (Shines like ever as Nina), Paul Rudd as George, Timothy Daly, Amo Gulinello, Alan Alda and Allison Janney. Of course that are a lot of movies about unrequited love (Look for one the best movies of this topic "My Own Private Idaho") but the bitter way, dressed of colorful, of "The Object of my Affection" is unique. The story is not a "chick flick" although that much thinks that. This movie is a contemporaneous drama which is fill of an optimistic voice, since the begin to the end. "The Object of my Affection" is great movie that keeps in mind of much - or only me, if is the case-, and marks the thing that "Will & Grace" makes with so greatness and that "The Next Best Thing" ruins. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.

And that the type of guy he was playing was not given a fair chance to prove his sensitivity in the first 50 or so minutes of the movie. And why is that? Because Aniston could never tell him what she wanted. You may feel the urge to bring up the scene where she tells him that is his fault. But, I think it's her fault. I don't usually blame the woman, but in this movie I'm blaming George and Nina as a couple for the problems they encountered. Because together, they had the perfect excuse to never be honest. It would hurt the other's feelings. I'll bet that was the reason. Anyway, when watching would-be serious movies, I like to pick a character to identify with. In this movie, I wanted to be George. Not because I have ever cried thinking: "why can't I be a father" (thank God for that). But because I haven't had any luck in love and could easily see the attraction to a guy like Tim Daly's character. A pretty obvious manipulator. Other than intense good looks, he wouldn't keep his mouth shut about something even if he thought he'd swallow his shoe if he left it open. He's reliable and predictable. And God, that's what I want in a lover. I like surprises, but they also scare me. Again- I want total control. This kind of movie is not for people like me. But it is enough seeds to be able to make something grow out of it. As a piece of film-making, it's at least better crafted than a huge slew of modern Hollywood romantic movies. As formula, it's quite sloppy at times. But it mistakes its way into, I think, portraying George's new relationship with a younger guy with a sweet wild streak that makes me smile. It's not a movie that will challenge you to think much, but it won't hurt your face by making you frown too much either.

    I know this doesn't exactly sound like a rave review, my emotions regarding this film are kinda complex. The film certainly has its flaws, and while it hasn't aged as well as one might hope, the emotion behind the film is so genuine. It may be my own experiences, but I feel that this film has something to offer more than the obvious female and gay male audience. Jennifer Aniston is very likable as Nina, which is saying quite a bit for me because I tend to not go nuts over her. There are traces of her standard Rachel character, but she proves herself much more capable in this role. Paul Rudd does a great job as George, basing his character more on genuine human emotion than gay stereotypes. The emotional dynamic between these two is the central focus of the film and is written extremely well. All in all, this film definitely has its flaws, but its genuine emotional core make it worth checking out.

    That is the question that Nina have when she falls in love of a gay kindergarten teacher, George. If this is not a kind of romantic that you usually used to hear in an almost XXI century, now is so much different. In the same year comes "Will & Grace" and then "The Next Best Thing". Now, the relationship between gay man and straight woman is yet a typical formula of romantic Hollywood comedies (I guess that not always this characters live together, but always the lead female character has a gay friend, and a gay has to best friend to a single woman). If "The Object of my Affection" don't start it all, is (In movies, because "Will & Grace" is a great and very funny T.V show) the best of all films of this kind of plot - or better the best that i have seen-. In our lives, always we find special people that full us. That makes us feel so different, in a good -very good- way. But, in spite, this person is not always the suitable one. And, in spite that we know that, we suffer of this person. "The Object of my Affection" is the portrait of this kind of uncontrollable suffer by the heart of human beens, show it to us by the story of Nina, who met George, who broke up with his boyfriend. Nina, who see how sad is George for some of the problems that this broke up begins, decides to offer him to stay with her until he be stabilized. Nina lives with other man. She is pregnant of him. After a while, Nina begins a strong relationship with George. The Nina begins to fall in loved of him... Wow, what problem going to begin! "The Object of my Affection" is a drama that, when you watch at the beginning like another romantic comedy which is all the opposite. "The Object of my Affection" is a tender drama that analyzed a hard topic, but that is inevitable in our lives: Love. The movie counts with great performances too: Jennifer Aniston (Shines like ever as Nina), Paul Rudd as George, Timothy Daly, Amo Gulinello, Alan Alda and Allison Janney. Of course that are a lot of movies about unrequited love (Look for one the best movies of this topic "My Own Private Idaho") but the bitter way, dressed of colorful, of "The Object of my Affection" is unique. The story is not a "chick flick" although that much thinks that. This movie is a contemporaneous drama which is fill of an optimistic voice, since the begin to the end. "The Object of my Affection" is great movie that keeps in mind of much - or only me, if is the case-, and marks the thing that "Will & Grace" makes with so greatness and that "The Next Best Thing" ruins. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.

    In order for me to get properly engaged in a movie, I have to relate to most of the major players. As such, I tend to shy away from gay-themed movies, because I just can't relate to the characters and their situations. This movie is different. I found all of the characters to be extremely well-written. There was a lot of depth-of-character in all of the parts, both major and minor ones. This movie stayed away from clich&eacute;s and took a fresh look at the complexities of love and the expectations that we have about our relationships. Perhaps the best compliment is that I had no idea how this movie was going to end. That's rare in modern romance movies. The acting was exceptional as well. Paul Rudd seems to be taking shallow roles in shallow comedies like "Ron Burgundy" lately, but it's clear from this that he can engage in serious acting. I wasn't terribly impressed with Jennifer Anniston's acting in "Friends", but it's clear from this film - and subsequent work - that she is capable of acting with considerable depth. I was quite surprised at the relatively low rating from the IMDb crowd. It is quite possible that is was marketed wrong. I watched this on HBO and it was billed as a romantic comedy. No way. This is a very dramatic movie, with some deeply sad and heartfelt moments. I recommend this movie very highly if you are interested in character-centered, movies with complex, expressive emotions.

    Contemporary society's focus on homosexuality takes an interesting twist in this 1998 movie. Basically, a pregnant Jennifer Aniston wishes to raise her baby with an endearing homosexual she has met. This movie doesn't stop there. The race question is also brought in when she meets a black police officer. Paul Rudd is excellent as the conflicted gay guy. He has feelings for the Aniston character, but his male preference ultimately prevails. The picture is a good one as everyone eventually comes to terms with their beliefs. In a brief appearance, Nigel Hawthorne shines as an elderly, realistic gay man. We're in the mix of the wealthy and not so wealthy people here. We have writers, educators and others confronting their homosexuality.

    Nina played by Jennifer Aniston invites a gay man (George) into her house to be her room mate, first sign her relationship with her bf (Vince) is going south is she doesn't invite him to move in. Nina soon falls pregnant and then decides to move in with Vince. However Nina gets frustrated when Vince makes some comments about trophys given in schools. I found the reaction or the script was just unbelievable. The character Nina is so shallow that she can not have a difference of opinion or respect other peoples opinions that she needs to react in a way as if Vince was abusing her. Nina then falls in love with George. The concept of a straight women falling in love with a gay man, the absurdity that she believes a relationship should work. Sure, some woman might be able to relate, but others with brain cells know and understand the stupidity of the concept. The film is a complete fantasy with little to none humour. I don't recall actually laughing once. Don't waste your time.

    Thought the story is light, it delivers entertainment and a good time. The casting is very spontaneous, the actors weren't that known back there but were good enough to act decently. The story is quite original, I have never seen other movie where the girl falls in love with a gay man. The plot would be better if these kind of people really existed; we know that in real life people are prejudiced, intolerant and fight for anything (specially we, men). In this film, people accept things very easily, men don't dispute women, parents have no problem in the daughter living with a homossexual and biological father has no problem with the "new dad". Those things create lots of fray in real life. So that's it; an original comedy not much funny, but satisfying enough to don't disappoint the viewer.

    Probably tells much about this film, when I say I have only seen a couple of better romantic comedies. The characters are portrayed excellently, the plot is great, everything works. The one thing that didn't work for me was the ending. As said earlier, the characters are great, and every one of the actors do a good job portraying their own; Jennifer Aniston pulls out one of her best performances, if not even the best. When ever I have seen Paul Rudd, he has pulled out a good effort, as is now. The side characters are interesting, yet aren't shown too much. This, along the fact that it makes you laugh at least a few times, has a couple of magnificent scenes, and so on, make it very worth a while experience, a memorable two hours or so to spend on a movie. I'd encourage everyone, everyone to give it a shot. 8.1/10

    Gay Robert Joeley (Tim Daley) more or less throws boyfriend George (Paul Rudd) out of the house. George moves in with str8 Nina (Jennifer Aniston). They get along great until Nina gets pregnant from boyfriend Vince (John Pankow). However she doesn't want to live with Vince--she wants George to live with her and bring up the baby. He initially agrees--but then Nina gets jealous if he tries to have a boyfriend! I saw this back in 1998 and had no idea if I liked it or not. Seeing it again I now know why--this is entertaining but simplistic and dumbed down. I'm no fan of the original novel but it was a lot grittier and concentrated more on George than the movie. But--Aniston was more well known than Rudd so this movie is now all about her and totally ignores any of the more interesting aspects of the novel and makes the characters more accessible. This is the kind of movie where a teacher and a social worker can easily afford a HUGE beautiful apartment in Brooklyn. Also it's suggested (in a truly horrendous scene) that Rudd COULD switch from guys to her. Speaking as a gay man I can tell you--it doesn't happen. You don't just switch back and forth. Still--for 1998--that's probably as far as a studio would go. Also a kiss between Rudd and another man was cut out so it wouldn't offend str8 audiences! (Although him and Amo Gulinello have a few cute little kisses). Still, if you can ignore that, it's OK. It has a good cast and acting helps. Aniston is very good in her role. Rudd is totally miscast as a gay man (I never believed him for one second) but he's not bad. Nigel Hawthorne and Gulinello are excellent as a gay couple. Daley is interesting (and hot) as George's ex. Alison Janney is just hysterical as Ansiton's sister. And it was fun to see Stephen Macht (The Spirit himself) in a bit as an ex of George! The movie looks good and has a nice music score too. So it's not even close to treating its subject seriously but it works as fluff. I give it a 7.

    Oh, Joy, joy......another film about a gay man who only needs the right woman to convert him. The scene in which Aniston's character SUCCEEDS in seducing Rudd's character is purposely geared to have the audience saying "See, I KNEW he didn't REALLY want to be gay. Now he'll be cured and they can live happily ever after!". The only thing that stops them actually having sex is A PHONE CALL! He doesn't stop it...it has to be a freaking phone call! What an epic cop-out! I'm sorry to burst your hetero female fantasy bubble, Ms. Wasserstein, but men who are actually gay DON'T.....even deep down....want to have sex with women....even if they're Jennifer Anniston. All the gay relationships in the film are depicted as horrible, shallow messes which further serves to egg the audience on in hoping that Rudd's character will be "converted" by Anniston's because he'd be so much happier with her if he could only see. That makes me so angry I could vomit! It makes no difference that he ends up with a guy at the end. The point of the script is that he COULD have been converted. This is homophobia, pure and simple and no less sickening than that to be found in a Klan meeting or a Baptist church. I....HATE....THIS....MOVIE!

    My guilty-pleasure enjoyment of Hollywood romantic comedies is just one of the things that ostracizes me from the rest of the populace. Because I know the type of person who quietly watches something like a Sandra Bullock movie and thinks about tying Denis Leary up so we can fully iron out the terms of our rocky relationship (if it wasn't rocky, it wouldn't be a "comedy" now would it?), and demanding security in his commitment before I continue with the wining and dining process, is not typically the same type of person who enjoys watching horror films for the love of art. That's me, flaws and all. I am a freak full of vigor, but darn it- I want total control. That's why this kind of movie makes me all noodle-like. I'm too wishy-washy (like that pioneer of discontent, Charlie Brown before me) to tell the world that this is not the way things should be. The lives Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd lead in this movie are the result of not having the guts to tell other people what they want. They still get what they want, which is the product of the Happy Ending disease of Hollywood cinema. But do I really have to sit and watch them talk and talk, without just coming out and saying: "this is what I want"? I hope that's not too cryptic. Anyway, the answer to that question is: yes. I have to sit and watch this talky movie. Not because it's a Hollywood film from a fairly homophobic studio about a gay man and his quest to become a father... with a woman having a straight man's baby. But because all the good-looking men in this movie are idiots. Except the young guy, Paul - played by the dreamy and very talented Amo Gulinello (who has since been completely buried in the cast list under a mountain of bit part players just because years later they did high-profile movies and shows). I have a theory about really good-looking men. I find almost all of them under the age of 25 only get attention for being very good looking, and then later can only combat becoming a complete moron if they are raised by really intelligent but also easy-going and honest parents. Not honest in the eyes of the world. Because, who cares what everyone else thinks? But honest in that they don't lie to or hold potentially vital information from their children. Jennifer Aniston's Nina is so flawed, her drama in the movie is barely worth discussing. Let me just say though that, while I'm sure every romantic comedy fan in the audience will shout: "you can do so much better than Vince!," meaning the character (not actor Vince Vaughn), I found John Pankow absolutely irresistible in the film. And that the type of guy he was playing was not given a fair chance to prove his sensitivity in the first 50 or so minutes of the movie. And why is that? Because Aniston could never tell him what she wanted. You may feel the urge to bring up the scene where she tells him that is his fault. But, I think it's her fault. I don't usually blame the woman, but in this movie I'm blaming George and Nina as a couple for the problems they encountered. Because together, they had the perfect excuse to never be honest. It would hurt the other's feelings. I'll bet that was the reason. Anyway, when watching would-be serious movies, I like to pick a character to identify with. In this movie, I wanted to be George. Not because I have ever cried thinking: "why can't I be a father" (thank God for that).

As formula, it's quite sloppy at times. But it mistakes its way into, I think, portraying George's new relationship with a younger guy with a sweet wild streak that makes me smile. It's not a movie that will challenge you to think much, but it won't hurt your face by making you frown too much either.

They get along great until Nina gets pregnant from boyfriend Vince (John Pankow). However she doesn't want to live with Vince--she wants George to live with her and bring up the baby. He initially agrees--but then Nina gets jealous if he tries to have a boyfriend! I saw this back in 1998 and had no idea if I liked it or not. Seeing it again I now know why--this is entertaining but simplistic and dumbed down. I'm no fan of the original novel but it was a lot grittier and concentrated more on George than the movie. But--Aniston was more well known than Rudd so this movie is now all about her and totally ignores any of the more interesting aspects of the novel and makes the characters more accessible. This is the kind of movie where a teacher and a social worker can easily afford a HUGE beautiful apartment in Brooklyn. Also it's suggested (in a truly horrendous scene) that Rudd COULD switch from guys to her. Speaking as a gay man I can tell you--it doesn't happen. You don't just switch back and forth. Still--for 1998--that's probably as far as a studio would go. Also a kiss between Rudd and another man was cut out so it wouldn't offend str8 audiences! (Although him and Amo Gulinello have a few cute little kisses). Still, if you can ignore that, it's OK. It has a good cast and acting helps. Aniston is very good in her role. Rudd is totally miscast as a gay man (I never believed him for one second) but he's not bad. Nigel Hawthorne and Gulinello are excellent as a gay couple. Daley is interesting (and hot) as George's ex. Alison Janney is just hysterical as Ansiton's sister. And it was fun to see Stephen Macht (The Spirit himself) in a bit as an ex of George! The movie looks good and has a nice music score too. So it's not even close to treating its subject seriously but it works as fluff. I give it a 7.

    Oh, Joy, joy......another film about a gay man who only needs the right woman to convert him. The scene in which Aniston's character SUCCEEDS in seducing Rudd's character is purposely geared to have the audience saying "See, I KNEW he didn't REALLY want to be gay. Now he'll be cured and they can live happily ever after!". The only thing that stops them actually having sex is A PHONE CALL! He doesn't stop it...it has to be a freaking phone call! What an epic cop-out! I'm sorry to burst your hetero female fantasy bubble, Ms. Wasserstein, but men who are actually gay DON'T.....even deep down....want to have sex with women....even if they're Jennifer Anniston. All the gay relationships in the film are depicted as horrible, shallow messes which further serves to egg the audience on in hoping that Rudd's character will be "converted" by Anniston's because he'd be so much happier with her if he could only see. That makes me so angry I could vomit! It makes no difference that he ends up with a guy at the end. The point of the script is that he COULD have been converted. This is homophobia, pure and simple and no less sickening than that to be found in a Klan meeting or a Baptist church. I....HATE....THIS....MOVIE!

    My guilty-pleasure enjoyment of Hollywood romantic comedies is just one of the things that ostracizes me from the rest of the populace. Because I know the type of person who quietly watches something like a Sandra Bullock movie and thinks about tying Denis Leary up so we can fully iron out the terms of our rocky relationship (if it wasn't rocky, it wouldn't be a "comedy" now would it?), and demanding security in his commitment before I continue with the wining and dining process, is not typically the same type of person who enjoys watching horror films for the love of art. That's me, flaws and all. I am a freak full of vigor, but darn it- I want total control. That's why this kind of movie makes me all noodle-like. I'm too wishy-washy (like that pioneer of discontent, Charlie Brown before me) to tell the world that this is not the way things should be. The lives Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd lead in this movie are the result of not having the guts to tell other people what they want. They still get what they want, which is the product of the Happy Ending disease of Hollywood cinema. But do I really have to sit and watch them talk and talk, without just coming out and saying: "this is what I want"? I hope that's not too cryptic. Anyway, the answer to that question is: yes. I have to sit and watch this talky movie. Not because it's a Hollywood film from a fairly homophobic studio about a gay man and his quest to become a father... with a woman having a straight man's baby. But because all the good-looking men in this movie are idiots. Except the young guy, Paul - played by the dreamy and very talented Amo Gulinello (who has since been completely buried in the cast list under a mountain of bit part players just because years later they did high-profile movies and shows). I have a theory about really good-looking men. I find almost all of them under the age of 25 only get attention for being very good looking, and then later can only combat becoming a complete moron if they are raised by really intelligent but also easy-going and honest parents. Not honest in the eyes of the world. Because, who cares what everyone else thinks? But honest in that they don't lie to or hold potentially vital information from their children. Jennifer Aniston's Nina is so flawed, her drama in the movie is barely worth discussing. Let me just say though that, while I'm sure every romantic comedy fan in the audience will shout: "you can do so much better than Vince!," meaning the character (not actor Vince Vaughn), I found John Pankow absolutely irresistible in the film. And that the type of guy he was playing was not given a fair chance to prove his sensitivity in the first 50 or so minutes of the movie. And why is that? Because Aniston could never tell him what she wanted. You may feel the urge to bring up the scene where she tells him that is his fault. But, I think it's her fault. I don't usually blame the woman, but in this movie I'm blaming George and Nina as a couple for the problems they encountered. Because together, they had the perfect excuse to never be honest. It would hurt the other's feelings. I'll bet that was the reason. Anyway, when watching would-be serious movies, I like to pick a character to identify with. In this movie, I wanted to be George. Not because I have ever cried thinking: "why can't I be a father" (thank God for that). But because I haven't had any luck in love and could easily see the attraction to a guy like Tim Daly's character. A pretty obvious manipulator. Other than intense good looks, he wouldn't keep his mouth shut about something even if he thought he'd swallow his shoe if he left it open. He's reliable and predictable. And God, that's what I want in a lover. I like surprises, but they also scare me. Again- I want total control. This kind of movie is not for people like me. But it is enough seeds to be able to make something grow out of it. As a piece of film-making, it's at least better crafted than a huge slew of modern Hollywood romantic movies. As formula, it's quite sloppy at times. But it mistakes its way into, I think, portraying George's new relationship with a younger guy with a sweet wild streak that makes me smile. It's not a movie that will challenge you to think much, but it won't hurt your face by making you frown too much either.

    I know this doesn't exactly sound like a rave review, my emotions regarding this film are kinda complex. The film certainly has its flaws, and while it hasn't aged as well as one might hope, the emotion behind the film is so genuine. It may be my own experiences, but I feel that this film has something to offer more than the obvious female and gay male audience. Jennifer Aniston is very likable as Nina, which is saying quite a bit for me because I tend to not go nuts over her. There are traces of her standard Rachel character, but she proves herself much more capable in this role. Paul Rudd does a great job as George, basing his character more on genuine human emotion than gay stereotypes. The emotional dynamic between these two is the central focus of the film and is written extremely well. All in all, this film definitely has its flaws, but its genuine emotional core make it worth checking out.

    That is the question that Nina have when she falls in love of a gay kindergarten teacher, George. If this is not a kind of romantic that you usually used to hear in an almost XXI century, now is so much different. In the same year comes "Will & Grace" and then "The Next Best Thing". Now, the relationship between gay man and straight woman is yet a typical formula of romantic Hollywood comedies (I guess that not always this characters live together, but always the lead female character has a gay friend, and a gay has to best friend to a single woman). If "The Object of my Affection" don't start it all, is (In movies, because "Will & Grace" is a great and very funny T.V show) the best of all films of this kind of plot - or better the best that i have seen-. In our lives, always we find special people that full us. That makes us feel so different, in a good -very good- way. But, in spite, this person is not always the suitable one. And, in spite that we know that, we suffer of this person. "The Object of my Affection" is the portrait of this kind of uncontrollable suffer by the heart of human beens, show it to us by the story of Nina, who met George, who broke up with his boyfriend. Nina, who see how sad is George for some of the problems that this broke up begins, decides to offer him to stay with her until he be stabilized. Nina lives with other man. She is pregnant of him. After a while, Nina begins a strong relationship with George. The Nina begins to fall in loved of him... Wow, what problem going to begin! "The Object of my Affection" is a drama that, when you watch at the beginning like another romantic comedy which is all the opposite. "The Object of my Affection" is a tender drama that analyzed a hard topic, but that is inevitable in our lives: Love. The movie counts with great performances too: Jennifer Aniston (Shines like ever as Nina), Paul Rudd as George, Timothy Daly, Amo Gulinello, Alan Alda and Allison Janney. Of course that are a lot of movies about unrequited love (Look for one the best movies of this topic "My Own Private Idaho") but the bitter way, dressed of colorful, of "The Object of my Affection" is unique. The story is not a "chick flick" although that much thinks that. This movie is a contemporaneous drama which is fill of an optimistic voice, since the begin to the end. "The Object of my Affection" is great movie that keeps in mind of much - or only me, if is the case-, and marks the thing that "Will & Grace" makes with so greatness and that "The Next Best Thing" ruins. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.

    In order for me to get properly engaged in a movie, I have to relate to most of the major players. As such, I tend to shy away from gay-themed movies, because I just can't relate to the characters and their situations. This movie is different. I found all of the characters to be extremely well-written. There was a lot of depth-of-character in all of the parts, both major and minor ones. This movie stayed away from clich&eacute;s and took a fresh look at the complexities of love and the expectations that we have about our relationships. Perhaps the best compliment is that I had no idea how this movie was going to end. That's rare in modern romance movies. The acting was exceptional as well. Paul Rudd seems to be taking shallow roles in shallow comedies like "Ron Burgundy" lately, but it's clear from this that he can engage in serious acting. I wasn't terribly impressed with Jennifer Anniston's acting in "Friends", but it's clear from this film - and subsequent work - that she is capable of acting with considerable depth. I was quite surprised at the relatively low rating from the IMDb crowd. It is quite possible that is was marketed wrong. I watched this on HBO and it was billed as a romantic comedy. No way. This is a very dramatic movie, with some deeply sad and heartfelt moments. I recommend this movie very highly if you are interested in character-centered, movies with complex, expressive emotions.

    Contemporary society's focus on homosexuality takes an interesting twist in this 1998 movie. Basically, a pregnant Jennifer Aniston wishes to raise her baby with an endearing homosexual she has met. This movie doesn't stop there. The race question is also brought in when she meets a black police officer. Paul Rudd is excellent as the conflicted gay guy. He has feelings for the Aniston character, but his male preference ultimately prevails. The picture is a good one as everyone eventually comes to terms with their beliefs. In a brief appearance, Nigel Hawthorne shines as an elderly, realistic gay man. We're in the mix of the wealthy and not so wealthy people here. We have writers, educators and others confronting their homosexuality.

    Nina played by Jennifer Aniston invites a gay man (George) into her house to be her room mate, first sign her relationship with her bf (Vince) is going south is she doesn't invite him to move in. Nina soon falls pregnant and then decides to move in with Vince. However Nina gets frustrated when Vince makes some comments about trophys given in schools. I found the reaction or the script was just unbelievable. The character Nina is so shallow that she can not have a difference of opinion or respect other peoples opinions that she needs to react in a way as if Vince was abusing her. Nina then falls in love with George. The concept of a straight women falling in love with a gay man, the absurdity that she believes a relationship should work. Sure, some woman might be able to relate, but others with brain cells know and understand the stupidity of the concept. The film is a complete fantasy with little to none humour. I don't recall actually laughing once. Don't waste your time.

    Thought the story is light, it delivers entertainment and a good time. The casting is very spontaneous, the actors weren't that known back there but were good enough to act decently. The story is quite original, I have never seen other movie where the girl falls in love with a gay man. The plot would be better if these kind of people really existed; we know that in real life people are prejudiced, intolerant and fight for anything (specially we, men). In this film, people accept things very easily, men don't dispute women, parents have no problem in the daughter living with a homossexual and biological father has no problem with the "new dad". Those things create lots of fray in real life. So that's it; an original comedy not much funny, but satisfying enough to don't disappoint the viewer.

    Probably tells much about this film, when I say I have only seen a couple of better romantic comedies. The characters are portrayed excellently, the plot is great, everything works. The one thing that didn't work for me was the ending. As said earlier, the characters are great, and every one of the actors do a good job portraying their own; Jennifer Aniston pulls out one of her best performances, if not even the best. When ever I have seen Paul Rudd, he has pulled out a good effort, as is now. The side characters are interesting, yet aren't shown too much. This, along the fact that it makes you laugh at least a few times, has a couple of magnificent scenes, and so on, make it very worth a while experience, a memorable two hours or so to spend on a movie. I'd encourage everyone, everyone to give it a shot. 8.1/10

Perhaps the best compliment is that I had no idea how this movie was going to end. That's rare in modern romance movies. The acting was exceptional as well. Paul Rudd seems to be taking shallow roles in shallow comedies like "Ron Burgundy" lately, but it's clear from this that he can engage in serious acting. I wasn't terribly impressed with Jennifer Anniston's acting in "Friends", but it's clear from this film - and subsequent work - that she is capable of acting with considerable depth. I was quite surprised at the relatively low rating from the IMDb crowd. It is quite possible that is was marketed wrong. I watched this on HBO and it was billed as a romantic comedy. No way. This is a very dramatic movie, with some deeply sad and heartfelt moments. I recommend this movie very highly if you are interested in character-centered, movies with complex, expressive emotions.
