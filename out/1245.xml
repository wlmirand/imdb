    There are only a few films that I would give ten stars and this is one of them. I might be slightly bias due to the fact that I am a fan of 2pac but I truly believe that this is one of the best films that I have seen. It follows the story of two friends Spoon (2pac) and Stretch (Tim Roth) as they attempt to get into a rehab centre so that they can kick their drug addiction. The film which also features Thandie Newton really makes you feel like you are going on the journey with these characters as both 2pac and Tim Roth give very convincing performances in this brilliant film that in my opinion is underrated. I would recommend this film to most people but I think 2pac's fans will appreciate it most of all.

    Actor Vondie Curtis-Hall, who I've seen in Broken Arrow, debuts as writer and director with this drug based film, the last to star rapper Tupac Shakur before his death from shooting, during post-production. Basically, in Detroit, Barbara 'Cookie' Cook (Thandie Newton) has overdosed on her first time using heroin, and her best friends and band mates Ezekiel 'Spoon' Whitmore (Shakur) and Alexander 'Stretch' Rawland (Tim Roth) decide to kick their habit. To do this they want to enrol on a detox program, but this is becoming very difficult as they sent from place to place. The big problem is that Spoon and Stretch are being searched for by the police after it looks like they are suspects to a murder. Also the drug fuelled men who really committed the murder, gangster D-Reper (Curtis-Hall) and his Henchman (Tom Towles) are after them as well. In the end, Cookie wakes up from her drug-induced coma and walks out of the same hospital where it looks like Spoon and Stretch are finally going to get what they want. Also starring Who Framed Roger Rabbit's Charles Fleischer as Mr. Woodson, Howard Hesseman as Blind Man, James Pickens Jr. as Supervisor, John Sayles as Cop #1 and Eric Payne as Cop #2. Shakur and Roth make a really good double act, Newton has her moments in the flashback sequences, and it is a darkly funny take on inner city life and some drug use, a good black comedy. Worth watching!

    When their friend Cookie {Thandie Newton} overdoses, Spoon {Tupac Shakur} and Stretch {Tim Roth} make the decision to kick their drug habits. However in spite of their determination they find themselves constantly hampered by red tape. Shunted from building to building the boys have enough on their plates as it is, but they also have the small matter of an irate drug lord after them as well. I tuned in to watch Gridlock'd expecting a buddy buddy nonsense piece of fluff, what I actually got was a darkly funny satire on the health-care state of America and an interesting flip side to the life of the drug addicted. Never one sided in its sympathies to either side of the fence, Vondie Curtis-Hall's {writer and director} picture throws up interesting posers whilst poking us in the ribs along the way. Both Shakur and Roth are excellent, creating a rich chemistry that is as believable as it is potent. The direction is relaxed, with Hall content to just let the cameras follow these guys from one situation to another. And the dialogue is zippy and easy on the ears. Some scenes, in spite of the expected contrivances, are hilarious, with one particular stabbing scene being an absolute riot {I kid you not}. To which leaves a film just crying out to be discovered by more people. The film serves as a fitting tribute to Shakur, who was sadly murdered before this film was even released. On the evidence of this piece, the music world not only lost a supremely talented poet of the street, but cinema also lost a talented actor. R.I.P Tupac Shakur 1971-1996.

    I watched this movie because Tim Roth is awesome, but as it turned out it has so much more to offer. First of all: even though it's entirely about drug abuse, it never turns overly dramatic. It's sad how these guys can't get a break, but it's also funny in some kind of sadistic way. Especially the abrupt ending captures that tone perfectly, it's so comically deadpan. Another thing that really surprised me was the acting talent of Tupac Shakur. Movies often used him as some kind of gimmick, but here he actually seems to be the best possible guy for the part. The whole appeal of the movie is actually to see the main characters interact, because the actors really work well together. They make this into a very grim but excellent drama/comedy.

    Didn't intend to watch but was flicking channels and hooked from the first few minutes. Maybe I should have known, but didn't realise it was Tupac Shakur initially - just thought I was watching a good actor I'd not seen before. A real shame such a talented man's life was taken..Roth & Shakur work incredibly well together despite some initial feelings that Shakur just seemed too cool to be hanging out with someone like Roth, but it works as the story moves along. Would recommend this to anyone as a well presented story with some genuinely funny moments...very minor SPOILER alert...watch out for the scene with the pocket knife later in the movie, great funny scene.

    I wasn't expecting too much from this offbeat comedy, especially as it takes a little while to get going, but was surprised at how good it was. This is thanks largely to the on-screen chemistry between Tim Roth and Tupac Shakur as a couple of drug addicts who decide to kick their habit when flatmate Thandie Newton nearly dies from an accidental overdose. From such thin premises are great films sometimes crafted, the thinness of the plot meaning that the writers inevitably need to rely on characterisation to flesh things out. If they get it right they can create a classic, if they fail we can all end up watching an interminable mess. Here, Vondie Curtis-Hall does succeed in creating a couple of improbably likable anti-heroes in the form of Stretch (Roth) and Spoon (Shakur), while falling down a little in the realism of some of their decisions. It's nice, though, to see a film about characters like these which isn't downbeat and depressing. Despite their situation they each have an innate optimism and drive that is endearing even if it doesn't quite ring true.

    I've always liked this movie. It really is sad to see Tupac. He was a promising actor, and this is a prime example. There is no doubt that he would have gone on to nothing but bigger and better things. This movie has a very real feel to it. The portrayal of civil servants (dept. of social services, and the police) is a times spot on, and at others way off. One thing that really stood out about the movie this most recent time viewing, is the lack of concern over "Strech"'s positive HIV status while "Spoon" is requesting to be stabbed to get into the emergency room. I just think "Spoon" would have been concerned about contracting HIV, as "Strech" was bleeding himself. More so, wouldn't this have come to "Strech"'s mind as well. I think the addition of some dialog regarding this would have been more responsible. Bottom line, this is a great movie that should be seen, 18 and up, and will remain in my library.

    I couldn't even stand it to watch it to the end. I gave up at the scene, when 2pac debates on where the best spot he could be stabbed would be in to make sure he gets injured without getting to close to death. OK, this flick is about two guys who are desperate to get into rehab. They strongly believe that has to happen here and now and only the big baaaad bureaucracy prevents those brilliant men from getting on the right path. It's simply pathetic. And all this pseudo-intellectualism, like them playing in a jazz band (actually in those scenes the music is pretty good) or seeing them debate on the meaning of life. It's a real cheesy flick full of scenes where you think "Who the hell wrote this script", "Did those guys actually get paid for doing this" or "My 3-year old kid is better at dialogs". A total waste of time.

    Imagine the lives of the two musicians, Stretch and Spoon, part of a jazz combo that receive a warning sign when the other member of the group, the sultry Cookie, the singer, is found almost comatose after a drug overdose. Stretch and Spoon decide they have been lucky, so far; they must change their lives and their dependency on drugs. Alas, the system is against them. The two embark in a vain attempt to be enrolled in Medicaid so they can be detoxed. Everything turns against them. To vent their frustrations, they visit the drug dealing Mud, but they are surprised what they find in the apartment. Then, to make matters worse, they are chased by a dangerous duo who want something they took from Mud's place that belong to them. The pair get into all kinds of hot water. They are even shown on the television news as the probable culprits for offing their friend. In every government agency the two visit, they are dealt a blow, as nothing comes as simple as what they thought would be a cinch. In order to accomplish being admitted to a hospital and be treated, Spoon asks his buddy to stab him, after Stretch has been shot in the arm. In a hilarious sequence, Stretch tries in vein to do what his friends want him to do. "Gridlock'd" directed by Vondie Curtis Hall, an actor making his debut behind the camera, is a personal triumph. Mr. Hall got an excellent crew to work with and amazing performances from Tim Roth and Tupac Shakur, a rap star who died too young. Mr. Shakur impresses as he holds his own against a more experienced film actor of the stature of Mr. Roth. Both are great fun to watch. Thandie Newton, a gorgeous actress, plays Cookie, a sort of singer with an unique style. John Sayles, who had directed Mr. Hall in "Passion Fish" has a brief role as a cop. This film will delight viewers with its fast pace in the mean streets of Detroit. The language might put some people off, but it works fine in the context of the action and what the characters are supposed to be.

    There's a sarcastic phrase people use here in the UK that goes, "How very different from the home life of our own dear Queen!" It definitely applies to this movie! Tupac Shakur and Tim Roth play two small-time drug-addled crooks who have a bad experience, so they decide to get clean. They're completely sincere and determined to do it, but the film is about how difficult it is, in practical terms, to get off drugs in today's USA. Despite all the political hype and the government programmes and the well-meaning organisations, when a guy actually walks in off the street and says 'Get Me Off Drugs', he faces a bewildering maze of stifling bureaucracy and indifferent public officials which seems designed to set him straight back on the cycle of despair. So the film is sometimes frustrating to watch. It's grim in parts too. But it's also very funny. Tim Roth is as good as ever, but Shakur is a revelation. His earlier films were not so good, but here (his final movie before being murdered) he seemed to hit a groove. The chemistry between the two leads is great. The film is really about friendship as much as anything else. Gridlocked is different to any film you've ever seen. At 91 minutes it doesn't out-stay its welcome, and the pacy direction keeps it moving along nicely. It's not a classic but it is well worth seeing.

The film which also features Thandie Newton really makes you feel like you are going on the journey with these characters as both 2pac and Tim Roth give very convincing performances in this brilliant film that in my opinion is underrated. I would recommend this film to most people but I think 2pac's fans will appreciate it most of all.

    Actor Vondie Curtis-Hall, who I've seen in Broken Arrow, debuts as writer and director with this drug based film, the last to star rapper Tupac Shakur before his death from shooting, during post-production. Basically, in Detroit, Barbara 'Cookie' Cook (Thandie Newton) has overdosed on her first time using heroin, and her best friends and band mates Ezekiel 'Spoon' Whitmore (Shakur) and Alexander 'Stretch' Rawland (Tim Roth) decide to kick their habit. To do this they want to enrol on a detox program, but this is becoming very difficult as they sent from place to place. The big problem is that Spoon and Stretch are being searched for by the police after it looks like they are suspects to a murder. Also the drug fuelled men who really committed the murder, gangster D-Reper (Curtis-Hall) and his Henchman (Tom Towles) are after them as well. In the end, Cookie wakes up from her drug-induced coma and walks out of the same hospital where it looks like Spoon and Stretch are finally going to get what they want. Also starring Who Framed Roger Rabbit's Charles Fleischer as Mr. Woodson, Howard Hesseman as Blind Man, James Pickens Jr. as Supervisor, John Sayles as Cop #1 and Eric Payne as Cop #2. Shakur and Roth make a really good double act, Newton has her moments in the flashback sequences, and it is a darkly funny take on inner city life and some drug use, a good black comedy. Worth watching!

    When their friend Cookie {Thandie Newton} overdoses, Spoon {Tupac Shakur} and Stretch {Tim Roth} make the decision to kick their drug habits. However in spite of their determination they find themselves constantly hampered by red tape. Shunted from building to building the boys have enough on their plates as it is, but they also have the small matter of an irate drug lord after them as well. I tuned in to watch Gridlock'd expecting a buddy buddy nonsense piece of fluff, what I actually got was a darkly funny satire on the health-care state of America and an interesting flip side to the life of the drug addicted. Never one sided in its sympathies to either side of the fence, Vondie Curtis-Hall's {writer and director} picture throws up interesting posers whilst poking us in the ribs along the way. Both Shakur and Roth are excellent, creating a rich chemistry that is as believable as it is potent. The direction is relaxed, with Hall content to just let the cameras follow these guys from one situation to another. And the dialogue is zippy and easy on the ears. Some scenes, in spite of the expected contrivances, are hilarious, with one particular stabbing scene being an absolute riot {I kid you not}. To which leaves a film just crying out to be discovered by more people. The film serves as a fitting tribute to Shakur, who was sadly murdered before this film was even released. On the evidence of this piece, the music world not only lost a supremely talented poet of the street, but cinema also lost a talented actor. R.I.P Tupac Shakur 1971-1996.

    I watched this movie because Tim Roth is awesome, but as it turned out it has so much more to offer. First of all: even though it's entirely about drug abuse, it never turns overly dramatic. It's sad how these guys can't get a break, but it's also funny in some kind of sadistic way. Especially the abrupt ending captures that tone perfectly, it's so comically deadpan. Another thing that really surprised me was the acting talent of Tupac Shakur. Movies often used him as some kind of gimmick, but here he actually seems to be the best possible guy for the part. The whole appeal of the movie is actually to see the main characters interact, because the actors really work well together. They make this into a very grim but excellent drama/comedy.

    Didn't intend to watch but was flicking channels and hooked from the first few minutes. Maybe I should have known, but didn't realise it was Tupac Shakur initially - just thought I was watching a good actor I'd not seen before. A real shame such a talented man's life was taken..Roth & Shakur work incredibly well together despite some initial feelings that Shakur just seemed too cool to be hanging out with someone like Roth, but it works as the story moves along. Would recommend this to anyone as a well presented story with some genuinely funny moments...very minor SPOILER alert...watch out for the scene with the pocket knife later in the movie, great funny scene.

    I wasn't expecting too much from this offbeat comedy, especially as it takes a little while to get going, but was surprised at how good it was. This is thanks largely to the on-screen chemistry between Tim Roth and Tupac Shakur as a couple of drug addicts who decide to kick their habit when flatmate Thandie Newton nearly dies from an accidental overdose. From such thin premises are great films sometimes crafted, the thinness of the plot meaning that the writers inevitably need to rely on characterisation to flesh things out. If they get it right they can create a classic, if they fail we can all end up watching an interminable mess. Here, Vondie Curtis-Hall does succeed in creating a couple of improbably likable anti-heroes in the form of Stretch (Roth) and Spoon (Shakur), while falling down a little in the realism of some of their decisions. It's nice, though, to see a film about characters like these which isn't downbeat and depressing. Despite their situation they each have an innate optimism and drive that is endearing even if it doesn't quite ring true.

    I've always liked this movie. It really is sad to see Tupac. He was a promising actor, and this is a prime example. There is no doubt that he would have gone on to nothing but bigger and better things. This movie has a very real feel to it. The portrayal of civil servants (dept. of social services, and the police) is a times spot on, and at others way off. One thing that really stood out about the movie this most recent time viewing, is the lack of concern over "Strech"'s positive HIV status while "Spoon" is requesting to be stabbed to get into the emergency room. I just think "Spoon" would have been concerned about contracting HIV, as "Strech" was bleeding himself. More so, wouldn't this have come to "Strech"'s mind as well. I think the addition of some dialog regarding this would have been more responsible. Bottom line, this is a great movie that should be seen, 18 and up, and will remain in my library.

    I couldn't even stand it to watch it to the end. I gave up at the scene, when 2pac debates on where the best spot he could be stabbed would be in to make sure he gets injured without getting to close to death. OK, this flick is about two guys who are desperate to get into rehab. They strongly believe that has to happen here and now and only the big baaaad bureaucracy prevents those brilliant men from getting on the right path. It's simply pathetic. And all this pseudo-intellectualism, like them playing in a jazz band (actually in those scenes the music is pretty good) or seeing them debate on the meaning of life. It's a real cheesy flick full of scenes where you think "Who the hell wrote this script", "Did those guys actually get paid for doing this" or "My 3-year old kid is better at dialogs". A total waste of time.

    Imagine the lives of the two musicians, Stretch and Spoon, part of a jazz combo that receive a warning sign when the other member of the group, the sultry Cookie, the singer, is found almost comatose after a drug overdose. Stretch and Spoon decide they have been lucky, so far; they must change their lives and their dependency on drugs. Alas, the system is against them. The two embark in a vain attempt to be enrolled in Medicaid so they can be detoxed. Everything turns against them. To vent their frustrations, they visit the drug dealing Mud, but they are surprised what they find in the apartment. Then, to make matters worse, they are chased by a dangerous duo who want something they took from Mud's place that belong to them. The pair get into all kinds of hot water. They are even shown on the television news as the probable culprits for offing their friend. In every government agency the two visit, they are dealt a blow, as nothing comes as simple as what they thought would be a cinch. In order to accomplish being admitted to a hospital and be treated, Spoon asks his buddy to stab him, after Stretch has been shot in the arm. In a hilarious sequence, Stretch tries in vein to do what his friends want him to do. "Gridlock'd" directed by Vondie Curtis Hall, an actor making his debut behind the camera, is a personal triumph. Mr. Hall got an excellent crew to work with and amazing performances from Tim Roth and Tupac Shakur, a rap star who died too young. Mr. Shakur impresses as he holds his own against a more experienced film actor of the stature of Mr. Roth. Both are great fun to watch. Thandie Newton, a gorgeous actress, plays Cookie, a sort of singer with an unique style. John Sayles, who had directed Mr. Hall in "Passion Fish" has a brief role as a cop. This film will delight viewers with its fast pace in the mean streets of Detroit. The language might put some people off, but it works fine in the context of the action and what the characters are supposed to be.

    There's a sarcastic phrase people use here in the UK that goes, "How very different from the home life of our own dear Queen!" It definitely applies to this movie! Tupac Shakur and Tim Roth play two small-time drug-addled crooks who have a bad experience, so they decide to get clean. They're completely sincere and determined to do it, but the film is about how difficult it is, in practical terms, to get off drugs in today's USA. Despite all the political hype and the government programmes and the well-meaning organisations, when a guy actually walks in off the street and says 'Get Me Off Drugs', he faces a bewildering maze of stifling bureaucracy and indifferent public officials which seems designed to set him straight back on the cycle of despair. So the film is sometimes frustrating to watch. It's grim in parts too. But it's also very funny. Tim Roth is as good as ever, but Shakur is a revelation. His earlier films were not so good, but here (his final movie before being murdered) he seemed to hit a groove. The chemistry between the two leads is great. The film is really about friendship as much as anything else. Gridlocked is different to any film you've ever seen. At 91 minutes it doesn't out-stay its welcome, and the pacy direction keeps it moving along nicely. It's not a classic but it is well worth seeing.
