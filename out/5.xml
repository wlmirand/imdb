    A derivative story and some miscasting along with a few side-bar plot fillers that go nowhere are the flaws that keep this from being an excellent serial killer movie in a nineties serialization of the genre. Holly Hunter as the modern-female lead detective (she drives and her partner is light stepping, easy going and soft spoken) is not really suited for it. The killer part also takes a suspension of disbelief from an actor that is not much of an actor. There are some creepy moments and it moves quickly and Sigourney Weaver's character, while initially irritating, starts to settle in to things and contributes nicely. The crimes are clever and the concept is even more clever if not fully engaged. It is an edge-of-your-seat try with some limited successes but the movie needed some sub-plot rewrites or removal and some main-plot revving.

    "Copycat" is a good and meritful thriller, perhaps one of the best from the 90s, where thrillers were usually more suspenseful and rich in plot lines than packed with action scenes. (This is a compliment). In other words, they don't make them like those thrillers anymore. Therefore, I think "Copycat" deserves the attention of any old-school thriller aficionado. It is less crude than "Silence of the lambs" and, in my opinion, more intelligent, too, but it simply suffered from the fact that it came later in time. "Copycat" is a movie about serial killers and, to a good extent for a commercial-purpose movie, it offers a great deal of information about the psychology and typical rituals of serial killers (apparently, the film-makers recruited world expert Robert K. Ressler for assessment and guidance throughout the making of the movie). There is one serial killer here, too, and one heroine, psychiatrist Helen Hudson, who is fighting incapacitating agoraphobia after being attacked and nearly killed by a psychopath who was obsessed with her. However, she can't help getting involved when young women start to get murdered. Helen will soon notice that the crime scenes are exact copies of grimly famous murders by famous serial killers from the past. "Copycat" is not a perfect movie. It does have its weaknesses: some plot lines are clearly superfluous and don't really fit in with the main plot line; there are other scenes which seem to intend to exploit a certain humorous potential about M.J., the female police detective, but don't really fulfill their purpose; and the last third of the movie feels definitely rushed in, as if some significant scenes had been left off at the editing room. I also got the clear feeling that the starting point, the idea behind the story, was not exploited to the fullest, and that a great movie could have come from it. But then, again, "Copycat" is also better than most others in its genre, and I would definitely put it higher than most thrillers that are made these days. Both Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles -I especially enjoyed Hunter's character, a mix of innocence and toughness-, and, even though William McNamara has more modest acting abilities overall, in this role he did a great job. Another good point about "Copycat" is that it respects the pacing and the tempos of a suspenseful movie, with building-up tension and a very good and long climax. My score is 7 stars out of 10.

    When I first started watching this I didn't really think it was up to much. However as it progressed it certainly improved, making the storyline highly addictive. I did find that some points (mostly the agoraphobic scenes) were a little weird and could have been portrayed differently. But this didn't stray from such a strong narrative and perfect performance of Sigourney Weaver. This film isn't a murder mystery, the murderer is clear from very near the beginning of the film, yet they still make the police hunt to finding him a real hook. I would definitely recommend watching this film.

    "For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there is a boy who is tired of pretending to be strong when he feels vulnerable." - Nancy Smith Part of a wave of early to mid 1990s serial killer movies, "Copycat" is a sleazy movie about a respected university professor who begrudgingly helps two San Francisco police detectives track down and apprehend a local serial killer. It's a twist on the "Silence of the Lambs"/"Manhunter" formula, with the caged maverick whom the detectives turn to for assistance being not a demented Hannibal Lecter type locked away in a maximum security prison, but a female expert on serial killers, played by Sigourney Weaver, who confines herself to her high-security apartment because of a traumatic attack which happened several years ago. This is the film's most interesting aspect: Weaver has been driven to agoraphobia by the attack, is now profoundly terrified of human beings, is scared of even opening her front door, and so conducts her entire life from behind a computer screen. Unfortunately the film completely wastes all interesting possibilities afforded by the Sigourney Weaver character. A similar thing happens to a character played by the often excellent Holly Hunter. She's a tough-cookie LA cop  a small gal in a big boy's world  but again her character is completely wasted. The film sets up two interesting female roles only to quickly discard them, using them both as mere cannon fodder. The way Weaver is tortured by serial killers for audience kicks is particularly tawdry. Interestingly, the film's serial killer likes to copy the work of other serial killers, and the film itself contains a string of scenes which copy other serial killer movies, but little is done with this self-referentiality. As with most serial killer films, the serial killer here is awkward, childlike, and gawky around women. As far back as "Peeping Tom", "Night of the Hunter", "Rope", "Psycho" and "Targets", serial killers have been portrayed as being representations of non-phallic sexuality (often their baldness signifies some androgyny or sexual malfunction). In each case the killer seeks to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control, often by specifically targeting women. "Psycho's" Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie. Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are "sexual deviants" is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do. David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that "it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has". Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he "Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever". In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity. In "Copycat's" case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. "Masculinity" has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

While th film will win no plaudits for originality or scares, it's still good to see a character driven thriller, rather than one intending to shock with bucket loads of gore and cheap scares. Weaver is great as the Agoraphobic, but it does become quite funny the amount of times she shouts out for her carer at the beginning. The actual story is quite good, but the two 'Tyler Durden' showings of the killer before we meet the character is awful, and just gives the whole game away. Connick Jr is truly great in this, but did he really have to look like the guy from MAD magazine? Even though it's on for more than two hours, it runs at a steady pace, and never really gets boring, thanks to the two leads.

    I would say after watching this movie, go and see the film, Seven by David Fincher. Both films were made in the same year, and follow similar story lines about serial killers. However, where-as in Seven, you have a film that's so dark and depressing that you're drawn in, and the killings, although not witnessed, can actually make you physically sick. The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially "Seven for those with weak stomachs." The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says "hello" to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

    "Copycat" is a tense thriller about the pursuit of a murderer whose declared intention is to "turn murder into art" which he does by recreating the work of some of the great serial killers of the past. Suspense, intrigue and danger are never far away and the well-written screenplay and the lively pace of this movie ensure that it remains totally gripping from start to finish. Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an eminent criminal psychologist and a recognised expert on serial killers. Her knowledge of their methods and motivations is extensive and her books on the subject have achieved great success. After delivering a lecture at a university, she's followed to the ladies' room by one of her previous subjects, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr) who viciously attacks her and leaves her hanging by her neck from a high level over a toilet cubicle. She's soon rescued but the trauma she suffers turns her into an agoraphobic recluse who becomes a virtual prisoner in her own luxury apartment. Some time later, Detective Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and her partner Detective Inspector Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) are investigating a series of murders in the San Francisco area and suspect that they might all be the work of one man. They seek the assistance of Dr Hudson because her specialised knowledge should enable them to track down the killer significantly quicker than they could without her help. Dr Hudson lives in a constant state of fear, suffers regular panic attacks and relies heavily on pills and alcohol to enable her to cope. Nevertheless, she does agree to help and soon recognises that the killer is copying the methods used by previous serial killers. Dr Hudson is able to identify the order in which the murderer is copying the famous serial killers and this proves to be helpful in deducing where he might strike next. She becomes increasingly terrified however, when the murderer starts to contact her via the Internet and both her and Monahan then feel seriously threatened when it becomes apparent that he's targeting them as his next victims. Hudson and Monahan are well-developed characters and the performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter certainly do them justice. Weaver is particularly good at conveying the state of terror in which her character lives whilst at the same time showing that before her breakdown, she was an indomitable and rather arrogant person. Monahan, on the other hand is interesting as a woman who operates successfully in a male dominated environment without losing her femininity. She's both tough and friendly but also secure enough to function in her role without feeling that she has to assume the characteristics of her male colleagues. Harry Connick Jnr is scary and idiosyncratic and provides the most memorable supporting performance in his small but very significant role. "Copycat" begins impressively with an attention grabbing sequence which culminates in the attack on Dr Hudson and then continues to keep the audience's interest high by following Monahan's investigation. The action takes place in an atmosphere that's consistently tense and disturbing and Jon Amiel's direction is exemplary.

    Gripping serial killer thriller that was overshadowed by the release of Se7en a month earlier. Weaver is an agoraphobic psychologist that specialises in serial killers. Holly Hunter is a detective with three similar and unsolved murders on her hands. It soon becomes apparent that these murders are copycat killings. The film is a bit disjointed in its who-done-it first act, before just revealing the killer to the audience. The does eventually work out in the film's favor as it becomes more of a character piece. Patton is wonderful as a jealous ex-lover of Hunter, one that spars verbally with Mulroney, but soon becomes a tragic and sympathetic character. Connick Jr. does well in a batshit bonkers role. The acting and characters carry the movie, even if the material becomes stretched. It's predictable and surprising in equal measure, but contains wonderful moments, such as an unrelated shooting, which intrude on the main plot, but flesh out the characters. Didn't bore me once.

    If it is a thriller that you like then Copycat is seriously one of those movies that will hold you transfixed. A psychiatrist who studies serial killers, Helen Hudson (Sigorney Wearver) is attacked in the toilets and almost killed by a psychotic individual named Daryl Lee Cullen (Harry Connick Junior). The trauma leaves her house bound for thirteen years. When a serial killer strikes San Fransisco and she begins by helping out but gets dragged in deeper. As with most thrillers, one has to be careful in revealing the plot because if you know too much the tenseness of the movie can be destroyed. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but not as many as in one like the Color of Night. Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers. Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention. I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason. Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, "I may be in here but I have disciples." Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like. The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

    Above par performances by a good cast couldn't really help the poor script and lazy directing. Sigourney Weaver does a great job as an agoraphobic/paranoid expert on serial killers helping detectives Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney (both of which did fine work portraying believable characters) hunt down a new breed of killer. You'll also find a great performance by Harry Connick Jr. even if he may have stolen his character from Brad Pitt's "Early Grayce" performance two years prior. The film starts out well, establishing both the plot and characters at a decent pace. The opening scene even gives us a good sense of tension, setting the stage for any upcoming suspense. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to show us the various relationships of all the characters (which should be obvious enough to most movie goers) instead of delving into details of the killer and/or killings. This slows the pace of the film too much in my opinion. The film begins with a somewhat original idea, but begins to fill with clich&eacute;s, leading to an end that is as dull as it is silly. Overall, it's not a horrible film. A good watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just don't expect too much. -Fuzzy

In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity. In "Copycat's" case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. "Masculinity" has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Criminal profiler and psychologist Dr Helen Hudson becomes entangled in the deadly mind game of a vicious copycat serial killer. Due to the horrific attack Helen suffered in her past as an agoraphobic she is confined to her apartment. The killer uses this against her in his murderous attempts to become a famous serial killer. Detectives M. J Monahan and Reuben Goetz they have the challenge of trying to capture the killer before he kills again and uses his chance to commit another murder.... While th film will win no plaudits for originality or scares, it's still good to see a character driven thriller, rather than one intending to shock with bucket loads of gore and cheap scares. Weaver is great as the Agoraphobic, but it does become quite funny the amount of times she shouts out for her carer at the beginning. The actual story is quite good, but the two 'Tyler Durden' showings of the killer before we meet the character is awful, and just gives the whole game away. Connick Jr is truly great in this, but did he really have to look like the guy from MAD magazine? Even though it's on for more than two hours, it runs at a steady pace, and never really gets boring, thanks to the two leads.

    I would say after watching this movie, go and see the film, Seven by David Fincher. Both films were made in the same year, and follow similar story lines about serial killers. However, where-as in Seven, you have a film that's so dark and depressing that you're drawn in, and the killings, although not witnessed, can actually make you physically sick. The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially "Seven for those with weak stomachs." The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says "hello" to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

    "Copycat" is a tense thriller about the pursuit of a murderer whose declared intention is to "turn murder into art" which he does by recreating the work of some of the great serial killers of the past. Suspense, intrigue and danger are never far away and the well-written screenplay and the lively pace of this movie ensure that it remains totally gripping from start to finish. Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an eminent criminal psychologist and a recognised expert on serial killers. Her knowledge of their methods and motivations is extensive and her books on the subject have achieved great success. After delivering a lecture at a university, she's followed to the ladies' room by one of her previous subjects, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr) who viciously attacks her and leaves her hanging by her neck from a high level over a toilet cubicle. She's soon rescued but the trauma she suffers turns her into an agoraphobic recluse who becomes a virtual prisoner in her own luxury apartment. Some time later, Detective Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and her partner Detective Inspector Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) are investigating a series of murders in the San Francisco area and suspect that they might all be the work of one man. They seek the assistance of Dr Hudson because her specialised knowledge should enable them to track down the killer significantly quicker than they could without her help. Dr Hudson lives in a constant state of fear, suffers regular panic attacks and relies heavily on pills and alcohol to enable her to cope. Nevertheless, she does agree to help and soon recognises that the killer is copying the methods used by previous serial killers. Dr Hudson is able to identify the order in which the murderer is copying the famous serial killers and this proves to be helpful in deducing where he might strike next. She becomes increasingly terrified however, when the murderer starts to contact her via the Internet and both her and Monahan then feel seriously threatened when it becomes apparent that he's targeting them as his next victims. Hudson and Monahan are well-developed characters and the performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter certainly do them justice. Weaver is particularly good at conveying the state of terror in which her character lives whilst at the same time showing that before her breakdown, she was an indomitable and rather arrogant person. Monahan, on the other hand is interesting as a woman who operates successfully in a male dominated environment without losing her femininity. She's both tough and friendly but also secure enough to function in her role without feeling that she has to assume the characteristics of her male colleagues. Harry Connick Jnr is scary and idiosyncratic and provides the most memorable supporting performance in his small but very significant role. "Copycat" begins impressively with an attention grabbing sequence which culminates in the attack on Dr Hudson and then continues to keep the audience's interest high by following Monahan's investigation. The action takes place in an atmosphere that's consistently tense and disturbing and Jon Amiel's direction is exemplary.

    Gripping serial killer thriller that was overshadowed by the release of Se7en a month earlier. Weaver is an agoraphobic psychologist that specialises in serial killers. Holly Hunter is a detective with three similar and unsolved murders on her hands. It soon becomes apparent that these murders are copycat killings. The film is a bit disjointed in its who-done-it first act, before just revealing the killer to the audience. The does eventually work out in the film's favor as it becomes more of a character piece. Patton is wonderful as a jealous ex-lover of Hunter, one that spars verbally with Mulroney, but soon becomes a tragic and sympathetic character. Connick Jr. does well in a batshit bonkers role. The acting and characters carry the movie, even if the material becomes stretched. It's predictable and surprising in equal measure, but contains wonderful moments, such as an unrelated shooting, which intrude on the main plot, but flesh out the characters. Didn't bore me once.

    If it is a thriller that you like then Copycat is seriously one of those movies that will hold you transfixed. A psychiatrist who studies serial killers, Helen Hudson (Sigorney Wearver) is attacked in the toilets and almost killed by a psychotic individual named Daryl Lee Cullen (Harry Connick Junior). The trauma leaves her house bound for thirteen years. When a serial killer strikes San Fransisco and she begins by helping out but gets dragged in deeper. As with most thrillers, one has to be careful in revealing the plot because if you know too much the tenseness of the movie can be destroyed. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but not as many as in one like the Color of Night. Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers. Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention. I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason. Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, "I may be in here but I have disciples." Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like. The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

    Above par performances by a good cast couldn't really help the poor script and lazy directing. Sigourney Weaver does a great job as an agoraphobic/paranoid expert on serial killers helping detectives Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney (both of which did fine work portraying believable characters) hunt down a new breed of killer. You'll also find a great performance by Harry Connick Jr. even if he may have stolen his character from Brad Pitt's "Early Grayce" performance two years prior. The film starts out well, establishing both the plot and characters at a decent pace. The opening scene even gives us a good sense of tension, setting the stage for any upcoming suspense. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to show us the various relationships of all the characters (which should be obvious enough to most movie goers) instead of delving into details of the killer and/or killings. This slows the pace of the film too much in my opinion. The film begins with a somewhat original idea, but begins to fill with clich&eacute;s, leading to an end that is as dull as it is silly. Overall, it's not a horrible film. A good watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just don't expect too much. -Fuzzy

    A derivative story and some miscasting along with a few side-bar plot fillers that go nowhere are the flaws that keep this from being an excellent serial killer movie in a nineties serialization of the genre. Holly Hunter as the modern-female lead detective (she drives and her partner is light stepping, easy going and soft spoken) is not really suited for it. The killer part also takes a suspension of disbelief from an actor that is not much of an actor. There are some creepy moments and it moves quickly and Sigourney Weaver's character, while initially irritating, starts to settle in to things and contributes nicely. The crimes are clever and the concept is even more clever if not fully engaged. It is an edge-of-your-seat try with some limited successes but the movie needed some sub-plot rewrites or removal and some main-plot revving.

    "Copycat" is a good and meritful thriller, perhaps one of the best from the 90s, where thrillers were usually more suspenseful and rich in plot lines than packed with action scenes. (This is a compliment). In other words, they don't make them like those thrillers anymore. Therefore, I think "Copycat" deserves the attention of any old-school thriller aficionado. It is less crude than "Silence of the lambs" and, in my opinion, more intelligent, too, but it simply suffered from the fact that it came later in time. "Copycat" is a movie about serial killers and, to a good extent for a commercial-purpose movie, it offers a great deal of information about the psychology and typical rituals of serial killers (apparently, the film-makers recruited world expert Robert K. Ressler for assessment and guidance throughout the making of the movie). There is one serial killer here, too, and one heroine, psychiatrist Helen Hudson, who is fighting incapacitating agoraphobia after being attacked and nearly killed by a psychopath who was obsessed with her. However, she can't help getting involved when young women start to get murdered. Helen will soon notice that the crime scenes are exact copies of grimly famous murders by famous serial killers from the past. "Copycat" is not a perfect movie. It does have its weaknesses: some plot lines are clearly superfluous and don't really fit in with the main plot line; there are other scenes which seem to intend to exploit a certain humorous potential about M.J., the female police detective, but don't really fulfill their purpose; and the last third of the movie feels definitely rushed in, as if some significant scenes had been left off at the editing room. I also got the clear feeling that the starting point, the idea behind the story, was not exploited to the fullest, and that a great movie could have come from it. But then, again, "Copycat" is also better than most others in its genre, and I would definitely put it higher than most thrillers that are made these days. Both Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles -I especially enjoyed Hunter's character, a mix of innocence and toughness-, and, even though William McNamara has more modest acting abilities overall, in this role he did a great job. Another good point about "Copycat" is that it respects the pacing and the tempos of a suspenseful movie, with building-up tension and a very good and long climax. My score is 7 stars out of 10.

    When I first started watching this I didn't really think it was up to much. However as it progressed it certainly improved, making the storyline highly addictive. I did find that some points (mostly the agoraphobic scenes) were a little weird and could have been portrayed differently. But this didn't stray from such a strong narrative and perfect performance of Sigourney Weaver. This film isn't a murder mystery, the murderer is clear from very near the beginning of the film, yet they still make the police hunt to finding him a real hook. I would definitely recommend watching this film.

    "For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there is a boy who is tired of pretending to be strong when he feels vulnerable." - Nancy Smith Part of a wave of early to mid 1990s serial killer movies, "Copycat" is a sleazy movie about a respected university professor who begrudgingly helps two San Francisco police detectives track down and apprehend a local serial killer. It's a twist on the "Silence of the Lambs"/"Manhunter" formula, with the caged maverick whom the detectives turn to for assistance being not a demented Hannibal Lecter type locked away in a maximum security prison, but a female expert on serial killers, played by Sigourney Weaver, who confines herself to her high-security apartment because of a traumatic attack which happened several years ago. This is the film's most interesting aspect: Weaver has been driven to agoraphobia by the attack, is now profoundly terrified of human beings, is scared of even opening her front door, and so conducts her entire life from behind a computer screen. Unfortunately the film completely wastes all interesting possibilities afforded by the Sigourney Weaver character. A similar thing happens to a character played by the often excellent Holly Hunter. She's a tough-cookie LA cop  a small gal in a big boy's world  but again her character is completely wasted. The film sets up two interesting female roles only to quickly discard them, using them both as mere cannon fodder. The way Weaver is tortured by serial killers for audience kicks is particularly tawdry. Interestingly, the film's serial killer likes to copy the work of other serial killers, and the film itself contains a string of scenes which copy other serial killer movies, but little is done with this self-referentiality. As with most serial killer films, the serial killer here is awkward, childlike, and gawky around women. As far back as "Peeping Tom", "Night of the Hunter", "Rope", "Psycho" and "Targets", serial killers have been portrayed as being representations of non-phallic sexuality (often their baldness signifies some androgyny or sexual malfunction). In each case the killer seeks to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control, often by specifically targeting women. "Psycho's" Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie. Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are "sexual deviants" is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do. David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that "it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has". Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he "Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever". In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity. In "Copycat's" case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. "Masculinity" has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason. Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, "I may be in here but I have disciples." Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like. The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

    Above par performances by a good cast couldn't really help the poor script and lazy directing. Sigourney Weaver does a great job as an agoraphobic/paranoid expert on serial killers helping detectives Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney (both of which did fine work portraying believable characters) hunt down a new breed of killer. You'll also find a great performance by Harry Connick Jr. even if he may have stolen his character from Brad Pitt's "Early Grayce" performance two years prior. The film starts out well, establishing both the plot and characters at a decent pace. The opening scene even gives us a good sense of tension, setting the stage for any upcoming suspense. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to show us the various relationships of all the characters (which should be obvious enough to most movie goers) instead of delving into details of the killer and/or killings. This slows the pace of the film too much in my opinion. The film begins with a somewhat original idea, but begins to fill with clich&eacute;s, leading to an end that is as dull as it is silly. Overall, it's not a horrible film. A good watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just don't expect too much. -Fuzzy

    A derivative story and some miscasting along with a few side-bar plot fillers that go nowhere are the flaws that keep this from being an excellent serial killer movie in a nineties serialization of the genre. Holly Hunter as the modern-female lead detective (she drives and her partner is light stepping, easy going and soft spoken) is not really suited for it. The killer part also takes a suspension of disbelief from an actor that is not much of an actor. There are some creepy moments and it moves quickly and Sigourney Weaver's character, while initially irritating, starts to settle in to things and contributes nicely. The crimes are clever and the concept is even more clever if not fully engaged. It is an edge-of-your-seat try with some limited successes but the movie needed some sub-plot rewrites or removal and some main-plot revving.

    "Copycat" is a good and meritful thriller, perhaps one of the best from the 90s, where thrillers were usually more suspenseful and rich in plot lines than packed with action scenes. (This is a compliment). In other words, they don't make them like those thrillers anymore. Therefore, I think "Copycat" deserves the attention of any old-school thriller aficionado. It is less crude than "Silence of the lambs" and, in my opinion, more intelligent, too, but it simply suffered from the fact that it came later in time. "Copycat" is a movie about serial killers and, to a good extent for a commercial-purpose movie, it offers a great deal of information about the psychology and typical rituals of serial killers (apparently, the film-makers recruited world expert Robert K. Ressler for assessment and guidance throughout the making of the movie). There is one serial killer here, too, and one heroine, psychiatrist Helen Hudson, who is fighting incapacitating agoraphobia after being attacked and nearly killed by a psychopath who was obsessed with her. However, she can't help getting involved when young women start to get murdered. Helen will soon notice that the crime scenes are exact copies of grimly famous murders by famous serial killers from the past. "Copycat" is not a perfect movie. It does have its weaknesses: some plot lines are clearly superfluous and don't really fit in with the main plot line; there are other scenes which seem to intend to exploit a certain humorous potential about M.J., the female police detective, but don't really fulfill their purpose; and the last third of the movie feels definitely rushed in, as if some significant scenes had been left off at the editing room. I also got the clear feeling that the starting point, the idea behind the story, was not exploited to the fullest, and that a great movie could have come from it. But then, again, "Copycat" is also better than most others in its genre, and I would definitely put it higher than most thrillers that are made these days. Both Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles -I especially enjoyed Hunter's character, a mix of innocence and toughness-, and, even though William McNamara has more modest acting abilities overall, in this role he did a great job. Another good point about "Copycat" is that it respects the pacing and the tempos of a suspenseful movie, with building-up tension and a very good and long climax. My score is 7 stars out of 10.

    When I first started watching this I didn't really think it was up to much. However as it progressed it certainly improved, making the storyline highly addictive. I did find that some points (mostly the agoraphobic scenes) were a little weird and could have been portrayed differently. But this didn't stray from such a strong narrative and perfect performance of Sigourney Weaver. This film isn't a murder mystery, the murderer is clear from very near the beginning of the film, yet they still make the police hunt to finding him a real hook. I would definitely recommend watching this film.

    "For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there is a boy who is tired of pretending to be strong when he feels vulnerable." - Nancy Smith Part of a wave of early to mid 1990s serial killer movies, "Copycat" is a sleazy movie about a respected university professor who begrudgingly helps two San Francisco police detectives track down and apprehend a local serial killer. It's a twist on the "Silence of the Lambs"/"Manhunter" formula, with the caged maverick whom the detectives turn to for assistance being not a demented Hannibal Lecter type locked away in a maximum security prison, but a female expert on serial killers, played by Sigourney Weaver, who confines herself to her high-security apartment because of a traumatic attack which happened several years ago. This is the film's most interesting aspect: Weaver has been driven to agoraphobia by the attack, is now profoundly terrified of human beings, is scared of even opening her front door, and so conducts her entire life from behind a computer screen. Unfortunately the film completely wastes all interesting possibilities afforded by the Sigourney Weaver character. A similar thing happens to a character played by the often excellent Holly Hunter. She's a tough-cookie LA cop  a small gal in a big boy's world  but again her character is completely wasted. The film sets up two interesting female roles only to quickly discard them, using them both as mere cannon fodder. The way Weaver is tortured by serial killers for audience kicks is particularly tawdry. Interestingly, the film's serial killer likes to copy the work of other serial killers, and the film itself contains a string of scenes which copy other serial killer movies, but little is done with this self-referentiality. As with most serial killer films, the serial killer here is awkward, childlike, and gawky around women. As far back as "Peeping Tom", "Night of the Hunter", "Rope", "Psycho" and "Targets", serial killers have been portrayed as being representations of non-phallic sexuality (often their baldness signifies some androgyny or sexual malfunction). In each case the killer seeks to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control, often by specifically targeting women. "Psycho's" Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie. Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are "sexual deviants" is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do. David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that "it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has". Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he "Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever". In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity. In "Copycat's" case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. "Masculinity" has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Criminal profiler and psychologist Dr Helen Hudson becomes entangled in the deadly mind game of a vicious copycat serial killer. Due to the horrific attack Helen suffered in her past as an agoraphobic she is confined to her apartment. The killer uses this against her in his murderous attempts to become a famous serial killer. Detectives M. J Monahan and Reuben Goetz they have the challenge of trying to capture the killer before he kills again and uses his chance to commit another murder.... While th film will win no plaudits for originality or scares, it's still good to see a character driven thriller, rather than one intending to shock with bucket loads of gore and cheap scares. Weaver is great as the Agoraphobic, but it does become quite funny the amount of times she shouts out for her carer at the beginning. The actual story is quite good, but the two 'Tyler Durden' showings of the killer before we meet the character is awful, and just gives the whole game away. Connick Jr is truly great in this, but did he really have to look like the guy from MAD magazine? Even though it's on for more than two hours, it runs at a steady pace, and never really gets boring, thanks to the two leads.

    I would say after watching this movie, go and see the film, Seven by David Fincher. Both films were made in the same year, and follow similar story lines about serial killers. However, where-as in Seven, you have a film that's so dark and depressing that you're drawn in, and the killings, although not witnessed, can actually make you physically sick. The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially "Seven for those with weak stomachs." The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says "hello" to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

    "Copycat" is a tense thriller about the pursuit of a murderer whose declared intention is to "turn murder into art" which he does by recreating the work of some of the great serial killers of the past. Suspense, intrigue and danger are never far away and the well-written screenplay and the lively pace of this movie ensure that it remains totally gripping from start to finish. Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an eminent criminal psychologist and a recognised expert on serial killers. Her knowledge of their methods and motivations is extensive and her books on the subject have achieved great success. After delivering a lecture at a university, she's followed to the ladies' room by one of her previous subjects, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr) who viciously attacks her and leaves her hanging by her neck from a high level over a toilet cubicle. She's soon rescued but the trauma she suffers turns her into an agoraphobic recluse who becomes a virtual prisoner in her own luxury apartment. Some time later, Detective Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and her partner Detective Inspector Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) are investigating a series of murders in the San Francisco area and suspect that they might all be the work of one man. They seek the assistance of Dr Hudson because her specialised knowledge should enable them to track down the killer significantly quicker than they could without her help. Dr Hudson lives in a constant state of fear, suffers regular panic attacks and relies heavily on pills and alcohol to enable her to cope. Nevertheless, she does agree to help and soon recognises that the killer is copying the methods used by previous serial killers. Dr Hudson is able to identify the order in which the murderer is copying the famous serial killers and this proves to be helpful in deducing where he might strike next. She becomes increasingly terrified however, when the murderer starts to contact her via the Internet and both her and Monahan then feel seriously threatened when it becomes apparent that he's targeting them as his next victims. Hudson and Monahan are well-developed characters and the performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter certainly do them justice. Weaver is particularly good at conveying the state of terror in which her character lives whilst at the same time showing that before her breakdown, she was an indomitable and rather arrogant person. Monahan, on the other hand is interesting as a woman who operates successfully in a male dominated environment without losing her femininity. She's both tough and friendly but also secure enough to function in her role without feeling that she has to assume the characteristics of her male colleagues. Harry Connick Jnr is scary and idiosyncratic and provides the most memorable supporting performance in his small but very significant role. "Copycat" begins impressively with an attention grabbing sequence which culminates in the attack on Dr Hudson and then continues to keep the audience's interest high by following Monahan's investigation. The action takes place in an atmosphere that's consistently tense and disturbing and Jon Amiel's direction is exemplary.

    Gripping serial killer thriller that was overshadowed by the release of Se7en a month earlier. Weaver is an agoraphobic psychologist that specialises in serial killers. Holly Hunter is a detective with three similar and unsolved murders on her hands. It soon becomes apparent that these murders are copycat killings. The film is a bit disjointed in its who-done-it first act, before just revealing the killer to the audience. The does eventually work out in the film's favor as it becomes more of a character piece. Patton is wonderful as a jealous ex-lover of Hunter, one that spars verbally with Mulroney, but soon becomes a tragic and sympathetic character. Connick Jr. does well in a batshit bonkers role. The acting and characters carry the movie, even if the material becomes stretched. It's predictable and surprising in equal measure, but contains wonderful moments, such as an unrelated shooting, which intrude on the main plot, but flesh out the characters. Didn't bore me once.

    If it is a thriller that you like then Copycat is seriously one of those movies that will hold you transfixed. A psychiatrist who studies serial killers, Helen Hudson (Sigorney Wearver) is attacked in the toilets and almost killed by a psychotic individual named Daryl Lee Cullen (Harry Connick Junior). The trauma leaves her house bound for thirteen years. When a serial killer strikes San Fransisco and she begins by helping out but gets dragged in deeper. As with most thrillers, one has to be careful in revealing the plot because if you know too much the tenseness of the movie can be destroyed. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but not as many as in one like the Color of Night. Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers. Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention. I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason. Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, "I may be in here but I have disciples." Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like. The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that "it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has". Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he "Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever". In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity. In "Copycat's" case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. "Masculinity" has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Criminal profiler and psychologist Dr Helen Hudson becomes entangled in the deadly mind game of a vicious copycat serial killer. Due to the horrific attack Helen suffered in her past as an agoraphobic she is confined to her apartment. The killer uses this against her in his murderous attempts to become a famous serial killer. Detectives M. J Monahan and Reuben Goetz they have the challenge of trying to capture the killer before he kills again and uses his chance to commit another murder.... While th film will win no plaudits for originality or scares, it's still good to see a character driven thriller, rather than one intending to shock with bucket loads of gore and cheap scares. Weaver is great as the Agoraphobic, but it does become quite funny the amount of times she shouts out for her carer at the beginning. The actual story is quite good, but the two 'Tyler Durden' showings of the killer before we meet the character is awful, and just gives the whole game away. Connick Jr is truly great in this, but did he really have to look like the guy from MAD magazine? Even though it's on for more than two hours, it runs at a steady pace, and never really gets boring, thanks to the two leads.

    I would say after watching this movie, go and see the film, Seven by David Fincher. Both films were made in the same year, and follow similar story lines about serial killers. However, where-as in Seven, you have a film that's so dark and depressing that you're drawn in, and the killings, although not witnessed, can actually make you physically sick. The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially "Seven for those with weak stomachs." The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says "hello" to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

    "Copycat" is a tense thriller about the pursuit of a murderer whose declared intention is to "turn murder into art" which he does by recreating the work of some of the great serial killers of the past. Suspense, intrigue and danger are never far away and the well-written screenplay and the lively pace of this movie ensure that it remains totally gripping from start to finish. Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an eminent criminal psychologist and a recognised expert on serial killers. Her knowledge of their methods and motivations is extensive and her books on the subject have achieved great success. After delivering a lecture at a university, she's followed to the ladies' room by one of her previous subjects, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr) who viciously attacks her and leaves her hanging by her neck from a high level over a toilet cubicle. She's soon rescued but the trauma she suffers turns her into an agoraphobic recluse who becomes a virtual prisoner in her own luxury apartment. Some time later, Detective Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and her partner Detective Inspector Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) are investigating a series of murders in the San Francisco area and suspect that they might all be the work of one man. They seek the assistance of Dr Hudson because her specialised knowledge should enable them to track down the killer significantly quicker than they could without her help. Dr Hudson lives in a constant state of fear, suffers regular panic attacks and relies heavily on pills and alcohol to enable her to cope. Nevertheless, she does agree to help and soon recognises that the killer is copying the methods used by previous serial killers. Dr Hudson is able to identify the order in which the murderer is copying the famous serial killers and this proves to be helpful in deducing where he might strike next. She becomes increasingly terrified however, when the murderer starts to contact her via the Internet and both her and Monahan then feel seriously threatened when it becomes apparent that he's targeting them as his next victims. Hudson and Monahan are well-developed characters and the performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter certainly do them justice. Weaver is particularly good at conveying the state of terror in which her character lives whilst at the same time showing that before her breakdown, she was an indomitable and rather arrogant person. Monahan, on the other hand is interesting as a woman who operates successfully in a male dominated environment without losing her femininity. She's both tough and friendly but also secure enough to function in her role without feeling that she has to assume the characteristics of her male colleagues. Harry Connick Jnr is scary and idiosyncratic and provides the most memorable supporting performance in his small but very significant role. "Copycat" begins impressively with an attention grabbing sequence which culminates in the attack on Dr Hudson and then continues to keep the audience's interest high by following Monahan's investigation. The action takes place in an atmosphere that's consistently tense and disturbing and Jon Amiel's direction is exemplary.

    Gripping serial killer thriller that was overshadowed by the release of Se7en a month earlier. Weaver is an agoraphobic psychologist that specialises in serial killers. Holly Hunter is a detective with three similar and unsolved murders on her hands. It soon becomes apparent that these murders are copycat killings. The film is a bit disjointed in its who-done-it first act, before just revealing the killer to the audience. The does eventually work out in the film's favor as it becomes more of a character piece. Patton is wonderful as a jealous ex-lover of Hunter, one that spars verbally with Mulroney, but soon becomes a tragic and sympathetic character. Connick Jr. does well in a batshit bonkers role. The acting and characters carry the movie, even if the material becomes stretched. It's predictable and surprising in equal measure, but contains wonderful moments, such as an unrelated shooting, which intrude on the main plot, but flesh out the characters. Didn't bore me once.

    If it is a thriller that you like then Copycat is seriously one of those movies that will hold you transfixed. A psychiatrist who studies serial killers, Helen Hudson (Sigorney Wearver) is attacked in the toilets and almost killed by a psychotic individual named Daryl Lee Cullen (Harry Connick Junior). The trauma leaves her house bound for thirteen years. When a serial killer strikes San Fransisco and she begins by helping out but gets dragged in deeper. As with most thrillers, one has to be careful in revealing the plot because if you know too much the tenseness of the movie can be destroyed. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but not as many as in one like the Color of Night. Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers. Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention. I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason. Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, "I may be in here but I have disciples." Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like. The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

    Above par performances by a good cast couldn't really help the poor script and lazy directing. Sigourney Weaver does a great job as an agoraphobic/paranoid expert on serial killers helping detectives Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney (both of which did fine work portraying believable characters) hunt down a new breed of killer. You'll also find a great performance by Harry Connick Jr. even if he may have stolen his character from Brad Pitt's "Early Grayce" performance two years prior. The film starts out well, establishing both the plot and characters at a decent pace. The opening scene even gives us a good sense of tension, setting the stage for any upcoming suspense. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to show us the various relationships of all the characters (which should be obvious enough to most movie goers) instead of delving into details of the killer and/or killings. This slows the pace of the film too much in my opinion. The film begins with a somewhat original idea, but begins to fill with clich&eacute;s, leading to an end that is as dull as it is silly. Overall, it's not a horrible film. A good watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just don't expect too much. -Fuzzy

    A derivative story and some miscasting along with a few side-bar plot fillers that go nowhere are the flaws that keep this from being an excellent serial killer movie in a nineties serialization of the genre. Holly Hunter as the modern-female lead detective (she drives and her partner is light stepping, easy going and soft spoken) is not really suited for it. The killer part also takes a suspension of disbelief from an actor that is not much of an actor. There are some creepy moments and it moves quickly and Sigourney Weaver's character, while initially irritating, starts to settle in to things and contributes nicely. The crimes are clever and the concept is even more clever if not fully engaged. It is an edge-of-your-seat try with some limited successes but the movie needed some sub-plot rewrites or removal and some main-plot revving.

    "Copycat" is a good and meritful thriller, perhaps one of the best from the 90s, where thrillers were usually more suspenseful and rich in plot lines than packed with action scenes. (This is a compliment). In other words, they don't make them like those thrillers anymore. Therefore, I think "Copycat" deserves the attention of any old-school thriller aficionado. It is less crude than "Silence of the lambs" and, in my opinion, more intelligent, too, but it simply suffered from the fact that it came later in time. "Copycat" is a movie about serial killers and, to a good extent for a commercial-purpose movie, it offers a great deal of information about the psychology and typical rituals of serial killers (apparently, the film-makers recruited world expert Robert K. Ressler for assessment and guidance throughout the making of the movie). There is one serial killer here, too, and one heroine, psychiatrist Helen Hudson, who is fighting incapacitating agoraphobia after being attacked and nearly killed by a psychopath who was obsessed with her. However, she can't help getting involved when young women start to get murdered. Helen will soon notice that the crime scenes are exact copies of grimly famous murders by famous serial killers from the past. "Copycat" is not a perfect movie. It does have its weaknesses: some plot lines are clearly superfluous and don't really fit in with the main plot line; there are other scenes which seem to intend to exploit a certain humorous potential about M.J., the female police detective, but don't really fulfill their purpose; and the last third of the movie feels definitely rushed in, as if some significant scenes had been left off at the editing room. I also got the clear feeling that the starting point, the idea behind the story, was not exploited to the fullest, and that a great movie could have come from it. But then, again, "Copycat" is also better than most others in its genre, and I would definitely put it higher than most thrillers that are made these days. Both Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles -I especially enjoyed Hunter's character, a mix of innocence and toughness-, and, even though William McNamara has more modest acting abilities overall, in this role he did a great job. Another good point about "Copycat" is that it respects the pacing and the tempos of a suspenseful movie, with building-up tension and a very good and long climax. My score is 7 stars out of 10.

    When I first started watching this I didn't really think it was up to much. However as it progressed it certainly improved, making the storyline highly addictive. I did find that some points (mostly the agoraphobic scenes) were a little weird and could have been portrayed differently. But this didn't stray from such a strong narrative and perfect performance of Sigourney Weaver. This film isn't a murder mystery, the murderer is clear from very near the beginning of the film, yet they still make the police hunt to finding him a real hook. I would definitely recommend watching this film.

    "For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there is a boy who is tired of pretending to be strong when he feels vulnerable." - Nancy Smith Part of a wave of early to mid 1990s serial killer movies, "Copycat" is a sleazy movie about a respected university professor who begrudgingly helps two San Francisco police detectives track down and apprehend a local serial killer. It's a twist on the "Silence of the Lambs"/"Manhunter" formula, with the caged maverick whom the detectives turn to for assistance being not a demented Hannibal Lecter type locked away in a maximum security prison, but a female expert on serial killers, played by Sigourney Weaver, who confines herself to her high-security apartment because of a traumatic attack which happened several years ago. This is the film's most interesting aspect: Weaver has been driven to agoraphobia by the attack, is now profoundly terrified of human beings, is scared of even opening her front door, and so conducts her entire life from behind a computer screen. Unfortunately the film completely wastes all interesting possibilities afforded by the Sigourney Weaver character. A similar thing happens to a character played by the often excellent Holly Hunter. She's a tough-cookie LA cop  a small gal in a big boy's world  but again her character is completely wasted. The film sets up two interesting female roles only to quickly discard them, using them both as mere cannon fodder. The way Weaver is tortured by serial killers for audience kicks is particularly tawdry. Interestingly, the film's serial killer likes to copy the work of other serial killers, and the film itself contains a string of scenes which copy other serial killer movies, but little is done with this self-referentiality. As with most serial killer films, the serial killer here is awkward, childlike, and gawky around women. As far back as "Peeping Tom", "Night of the Hunter", "Rope", "Psycho" and "Targets", serial killers have been portrayed as being representations of non-phallic sexuality (often their baldness signifies some androgyny or sexual malfunction). In each case the killer seeks to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control, often by specifically targeting women. "Psycho's" Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie. Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are "sexual deviants" is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do. David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that "it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has". Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he "Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever". In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity.

In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether.

Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers. Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention. I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason. Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, "I may be in here but I have disciples." Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like. The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

    Above par performances by a good cast couldn't really help the poor script and lazy directing. Sigourney Weaver does a great job as an agoraphobic/paranoid expert on serial killers helping detectives Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney (both of which did fine work portraying believable characters) hunt down a new breed of killer. You'll also find a great performance by Harry Connick Jr. even if he may have stolen his character from Brad Pitt's "Early Grayce" performance two years prior. The film starts out well, establishing both the plot and characters at a decent pace. The opening scene even gives us a good sense of tension, setting the stage for any upcoming suspense. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to show us the various relationships of all the characters (which should be obvious enough to most movie goers) instead of delving into details of the killer and/or killings. This slows the pace of the film too much in my opinion. The film begins with a somewhat original idea, but begins to fill with clich&eacute;s, leading to an end that is as dull as it is silly. Overall, it's not a horrible film. A good watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just don't expect too much. -Fuzzy

    A derivative story and some miscasting along with a few side-bar plot fillers that go nowhere are the flaws that keep this from being an excellent serial killer movie in a nineties serialization of the genre. Holly Hunter as the modern-female lead detective (she drives and her partner is light stepping, easy going and soft spoken) is not really suited for it. The killer part also takes a suspension of disbelief from an actor that is not much of an actor. There are some creepy moments and it moves quickly and Sigourney Weaver's character, while initially irritating, starts to settle in to things and contributes nicely. The crimes are clever and the concept is even more clever if not fully engaged. It is an edge-of-your-seat try with some limited successes but the movie needed some sub-plot rewrites or removal and some main-plot revving.

    "Copycat" is a good and meritful thriller, perhaps one of the best from the 90s, where thrillers were usually more suspenseful and rich in plot lines than packed with action scenes. (This is a compliment). In other words, they don't make them like those thrillers anymore. Therefore, I think "Copycat" deserves the attention of any old-school thriller aficionado. It is less crude than "Silence of the lambs" and, in my opinion, more intelligent, too, but it simply suffered from the fact that it came later in time. "Copycat" is a movie about serial killers and, to a good extent for a commercial-purpose movie, it offers a great deal of information about the psychology and typical rituals of serial killers (apparently, the film-makers recruited world expert Robert K. Ressler for assessment and guidance throughout the making of the movie). There is one serial killer here, too, and one heroine, psychiatrist Helen Hudson, who is fighting incapacitating agoraphobia after being attacked and nearly killed by a psychopath who was obsessed with her. However, she can't help getting involved when young women start to get murdered. Helen will soon notice that the crime scenes are exact copies of grimly famous murders by famous serial killers from the past. "Copycat" is not a perfect movie. It does have its weaknesses: some plot lines are clearly superfluous and don't really fit in with the main plot line; there are other scenes which seem to intend to exploit a certain humorous potential about M.J., the female police detective, but don't really fulfill their purpose; and the last third of the movie feels definitely rushed in, as if some significant scenes had been left off at the editing room. I also got the clear feeling that the starting point, the idea behind the story, was not exploited to the fullest, and that a great movie could have come from it. But then, again, "Copycat" is also better than most others in its genre, and I would definitely put it higher than most thrillers that are made these days. Both Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles -I especially enjoyed Hunter's character, a mix of innocence and toughness-, and, even though William McNamara has more modest acting abilities overall, in this role he did a great job. Another good point about "Copycat" is that it respects the pacing and the tempos of a suspenseful movie, with building-up tension and a very good and long climax. My score is 7 stars out of 10.

    When I first started watching this I didn't really think it was up to much. However as it progressed it certainly improved, making the storyline highly addictive. I did find that some points (mostly the agoraphobic scenes) were a little weird and could have been portrayed differently. But this didn't stray from such a strong narrative and perfect performance of Sigourney Weaver. This film isn't a murder mystery, the murderer is clear from very near the beginning of the film, yet they still make the police hunt to finding him a real hook. I would definitely recommend watching this film.

    "For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there is a boy who is tired of pretending to be strong when he feels vulnerable." - Nancy Smith Part of a wave of early to mid 1990s serial killer movies, "Copycat" is a sleazy movie about a respected university professor who begrudgingly helps two San Francisco police detectives track down and apprehend a local serial killer. It's a twist on the "Silence of the Lambs"/"Manhunter" formula, with the caged maverick whom the detectives turn to for assistance being not a demented Hannibal Lecter type locked away in a maximum security prison, but a female expert on serial killers, played by Sigourney Weaver, who confines herself to her high-security apartment because of a traumatic attack which happened several years ago. This is the film's most interesting aspect: Weaver has been driven to agoraphobia by the attack, is now profoundly terrified of human beings, is scared of even opening her front door, and so conducts her entire life from behind a computer screen. Unfortunately the film completely wastes all interesting possibilities afforded by the Sigourney Weaver character. A similar thing happens to a character played by the often excellent Holly Hunter. She's a tough-cookie LA cop  a small gal in a big boy's world  but again her character is completely wasted. The film sets up two interesting female roles only to quickly discard them, using them both as mere cannon fodder. The way Weaver is tortured by serial killers for audience kicks is particularly tawdry. Interestingly, the film's serial killer likes to copy the work of other serial killers, and the film itself contains a string of scenes which copy other serial killer movies, but little is done with this self-referentiality. As with most serial killer films, the serial killer here is awkward, childlike, and gawky around women. As far back as "Peeping Tom", "Night of the Hunter", "Rope", "Psycho" and "Targets", serial killers have been portrayed as being representations of non-phallic sexuality (often their baldness signifies some androgyny or sexual malfunction). In each case the killer seeks to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control, often by specifically targeting women. "Psycho's" Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie. Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are "sexual deviants" is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do. David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that "it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has". Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he "Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever". In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity. In "Copycat's" case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. "Masculinity" has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Criminal profiler and psychologist Dr Helen Hudson becomes entangled in the deadly mind game of a vicious copycat serial killer. Due to the horrific attack Helen suffered in her past as an agoraphobic she is confined to her apartment. The killer uses this against her in his murderous attempts to become a famous serial killer. Detectives M. J Monahan and Reuben Goetz they have the challenge of trying to capture the killer before he kills again and uses his chance to commit another murder.... While th film will win no plaudits for originality or scares, it's still good to see a character driven thriller, rather than one intending to shock with bucket loads of gore and cheap scares. Weaver is great as the Agoraphobic, but it does become quite funny the amount of times she shouts out for her carer at the beginning. The actual story is quite good, but the two 'Tyler Durden' showings of the killer before we meet the character is awful, and just gives the whole game away. Connick Jr is truly great in this, but did he really have to look like the guy from MAD magazine? Even though it's on for more than two hours, it runs at a steady pace, and never really gets boring, thanks to the two leads.

    I would say after watching this movie, go and see the film, Seven by David Fincher. Both films were made in the same year, and follow similar story lines about serial killers. However, where-as in Seven, you have a film that's so dark and depressing that you're drawn in, and the killings, although not witnessed, can actually make you physically sick. The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially "Seven for those with weak stomachs." The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says "hello" to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

    "Copycat" is a tense thriller about the pursuit of a murderer whose declared intention is to "turn murder into art" which he does by recreating the work of some of the great serial killers of the past. Suspense, intrigue and danger are never far away and the well-written screenplay and the lively pace of this movie ensure that it remains totally gripping from start to finish. Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an eminent criminal psychologist and a recognised expert on serial killers. Her knowledge of their methods and motivations is extensive and her books on the subject have achieved great success. After delivering a lecture at a university, she's followed to the ladies' room by one of her previous subjects, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr) who viciously attacks her and leaves her hanging by her neck from a high level over a toilet cubicle. She's soon rescued but the trauma she suffers turns her into an agoraphobic recluse who becomes a virtual prisoner in her own luxury apartment. Some time later, Detective Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and her partner Detective Inspector Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) are investigating a series of murders in the San Francisco area and suspect that they might all be the work of one man. They seek the assistance of Dr Hudson because her specialised knowledge should enable them to track down the killer significantly quicker than they could without her help. Dr Hudson lives in a constant state of fear, suffers regular panic attacks and relies heavily on pills and alcohol to enable her to cope. Nevertheless, she does agree to help and soon recognises that the killer is copying the methods used by previous serial killers. Dr Hudson is able to identify the order in which the murderer is copying the famous serial killers and this proves to be helpful in deducing where he might strike next. She becomes increasingly terrified however, when the murderer starts to contact her via the Internet and both her and Monahan then feel seriously threatened when it becomes apparent that he's targeting them as his next victims. Hudson and Monahan are well-developed characters and the performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter certainly do them justice. Weaver is particularly good at conveying the state of terror in which her character lives whilst at the same time showing that before her breakdown, she was an indomitable and rather arrogant person. Monahan, on the other hand is interesting as a woman who operates successfully in a male dominated environment without losing her femininity. She's both tough and friendly but also secure enough to function in her role without feeling that she has to assume the characteristics of her male colleagues. Harry Connick Jnr is scary and idiosyncratic and provides the most memorable supporting performance in his small but very significant role. "Copycat" begins impressively with an attention grabbing sequence which culminates in the attack on Dr Hudson and then continues to keep the audience's interest high by following Monahan's investigation. The action takes place in an atmosphere that's consistently tense and disturbing and Jon Amiel's direction is exemplary.

    Gripping serial killer thriller that was overshadowed by the release of Se7en a month earlier. Weaver is an agoraphobic psychologist that specialises in serial killers. Holly Hunter is a detective with three similar and unsolved murders on her hands. It soon becomes apparent that these murders are copycat killings. The film is a bit disjointed in its who-done-it first act, before just revealing the killer to the audience. The does eventually work out in the film's favor as it becomes more of a character piece. Patton is wonderful as a jealous ex-lover of Hunter, one that spars verbally with Mulroney, but soon becomes a tragic and sympathetic character. Connick Jr. does well in a batshit bonkers role. The acting and characters carry the movie, even if the material becomes stretched. It's predictable and surprising in equal measure, but contains wonderful moments, such as an unrelated shooting, which intrude on the main plot, but flesh out the characters. Didn't bore me once.

    If it is a thriller that you like then Copycat is seriously one of those movies that will hold you transfixed. A psychiatrist who studies serial killers, Helen Hudson (Sigorney Wearver) is attacked in the toilets and almost killed by a psychotic individual named Daryl Lee Cullen (Harry Connick Junior). The trauma leaves her house bound for thirteen years. When a serial killer strikes San Fransisco and she begins by helping out but gets dragged in deeper. As with most thrillers, one has to be careful in revealing the plot because if you know too much the tenseness of the movie can be destroyed. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but not as many as in one like the Color of Night. Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers. Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention. I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society).

"Psycho's" Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie. Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are "sexual deviants" is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do. David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that "it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has". Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he "Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever". In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity. In "Copycat's" case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. "Masculinity" has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Criminal profiler and psychologist Dr Helen Hudson becomes entangled in the deadly mind game of a vicious copycat serial killer. Due to the horrific attack Helen suffered in her past as an agoraphobic she is confined to her apartment. The killer uses this against her in his murderous attempts to become a famous serial killer. Detectives M. J Monahan and Reuben Goetz they have the challenge of trying to capture the killer before he kills again and uses his chance to commit another murder.... While th film will win no plaudits for originality or scares, it's still good to see a character driven thriller, rather than one intending to shock with bucket loads of gore and cheap scares. Weaver is great as the Agoraphobic, but it does become quite funny the amount of times she shouts out for her carer at the beginning. The actual story is quite good, but the two 'Tyler Durden' showings of the killer before we meet the character is awful, and just gives the whole game away. Connick Jr is truly great in this, but did he really have to look like the guy from MAD magazine? Even though it's on for more than two hours, it runs at a steady pace, and never really gets boring, thanks to the two leads.

    I would say after watching this movie, go and see the film, Seven by David Fincher. Both films were made in the same year, and follow similar story lines about serial killers. However, where-as in Seven, you have a film that's so dark and depressing that you're drawn in, and the killings, although not witnessed, can actually make you physically sick. The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially "Seven for those with weak stomachs." The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says "hello" to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

    "Copycat" is a tense thriller about the pursuit of a murderer whose declared intention is to "turn murder into art" which he does by recreating the work of some of the great serial killers of the past. Suspense, intrigue and danger are never far away and the well-written screenplay and the lively pace of this movie ensure that it remains totally gripping from start to finish. Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an eminent criminal psychologist and a recognised expert on serial killers. Her knowledge of their methods and motivations is extensive and her books on the subject have achieved great success. After delivering a lecture at a university, she's followed to the ladies' room by one of her previous subjects, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr) who viciously attacks her and leaves her hanging by her neck from a high level over a toilet cubicle. She's soon rescued but the trauma she suffers turns her into an agoraphobic recluse who becomes a virtual prisoner in her own luxury apartment. Some time later, Detective Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and her partner Detective Inspector Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) are investigating a series of murders in the San Francisco area and suspect that they might all be the work of one man. They seek the assistance of Dr Hudson because her specialised knowledge should enable them to track down the killer significantly quicker than they could without her help. Dr Hudson lives in a constant state of fear, suffers regular panic attacks and relies heavily on pills and alcohol to enable her to cope. Nevertheless, she does agree to help and soon recognises that the killer is copying the methods used by previous serial killers. Dr Hudson is able to identify the order in which the murderer is copying the famous serial killers and this proves to be helpful in deducing where he might strike next. She becomes increasingly terrified however, when the murderer starts to contact her via the Internet and both her and Monahan then feel seriously threatened when it becomes apparent that he's targeting them as his next victims. Hudson and Monahan are well-developed characters and the performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter certainly do them justice. Weaver is particularly good at conveying the state of terror in which her character lives whilst at the same time showing that before her breakdown, she was an indomitable and rather arrogant person. Monahan, on the other hand is interesting as a woman who operates successfully in a male dominated environment without losing her femininity. She's both tough and friendly but also secure enough to function in her role without feeling that she has to assume the characteristics of her male colleagues. Harry Connick Jnr is scary and idiosyncratic and provides the most memorable supporting performance in his small but very significant role. "Copycat" begins impressively with an attention grabbing sequence which culminates in the attack on Dr Hudson and then continues to keep the audience's interest high by following Monahan's investigation. The action takes place in an atmosphere that's consistently tense and disturbing and Jon Amiel's direction is exemplary.

    Gripping serial killer thriller that was overshadowed by the release of Se7en a month earlier. Weaver is an agoraphobic psychologist that specialises in serial killers. Holly Hunter is a detective with three similar and unsolved murders on her hands. It soon becomes apparent that these murders are copycat killings. The film is a bit disjointed in its who-done-it first act, before just revealing the killer to the audience. The does eventually work out in the film's favor as it becomes more of a character piece. Patton is wonderful as a jealous ex-lover of Hunter, one that spars verbally with Mulroney, but soon becomes a tragic and sympathetic character. Connick Jr. does well in a batshit bonkers role. The acting and characters carry the movie, even if the material becomes stretched. It's predictable and surprising in equal measure, but contains wonderful moments, such as an unrelated shooting, which intrude on the main plot, but flesh out the characters. Didn't bore me once.

    If it is a thriller that you like then Copycat is seriously one of those movies that will hold you transfixed. A psychiatrist who studies serial killers, Helen Hudson (Sigorney Wearver) is attacked in the toilets and almost killed by a psychotic individual named Daryl Lee Cullen (Harry Connick Junior). The trauma leaves her house bound for thirteen years. When a serial killer strikes San Fransisco and she begins by helping out but gets dragged in deeper. As with most thrillers, one has to be careful in revealing the plot because if you know too much the tenseness of the movie can be destroyed. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but not as many as in one like the Color of Night. Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers. Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention. I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason. Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, "I may be in here but I have disciples." Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like. The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

    Above par performances by a good cast couldn't really help the poor script and lazy directing. Sigourney Weaver does a great job as an agoraphobic/paranoid expert on serial killers helping detectives Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney (both of which did fine work portraying believable characters) hunt down a new breed of killer. You'll also find a great performance by Harry Connick Jr. even if he may have stolen his character from Brad Pitt's "Early Grayce" performance two years prior. The film starts out well, establishing both the plot and characters at a decent pace. The opening scene even gives us a good sense of tension, setting the stage for any upcoming suspense. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to show us the various relationships of all the characters (which should be obvious enough to most movie goers) instead of delving into details of the killer and/or killings. This slows the pace of the film too much in my opinion. The film begins with a somewhat original idea, but begins to fill with clich&eacute;s, leading to an end that is as dull as it is silly. Overall, it's not a horrible film. A good watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just don't expect too much. -Fuzzy

    A derivative story and some miscasting along with a few side-bar plot fillers that go nowhere are the flaws that keep this from being an excellent serial killer movie in a nineties serialization of the genre. Holly Hunter as the modern-female lead detective (she drives and her partner is light stepping, easy going and soft spoken) is not really suited for it. The killer part also takes a suspension of disbelief from an actor that is not much of an actor. There are some creepy moments and it moves quickly and Sigourney Weaver's character, while initially irritating, starts to settle in to things and contributes nicely. The crimes are clever and the concept is even more clever if not fully engaged. It is an edge-of-your-seat try with some limited successes but the movie needed some sub-plot rewrites or removal and some main-plot revving.

    "Copycat" is a good and meritful thriller, perhaps one of the best from the 90s, where thrillers were usually more suspenseful and rich in plot lines than packed with action scenes. (This is a compliment). In other words, they don't make them like those thrillers anymore. Therefore, I think "Copycat" deserves the attention of any old-school thriller aficionado. It is less crude than "Silence of the lambs" and, in my opinion, more intelligent, too, but it simply suffered from the fact that it came later in time. "Copycat" is a movie about serial killers and, to a good extent for a commercial-purpose movie, it offers a great deal of information about the psychology and typical rituals of serial killers (apparently, the film-makers recruited world expert Robert K. Ressler for assessment and guidance throughout the making of the movie). There is one serial killer here, too, and one heroine, psychiatrist Helen Hudson, who is fighting incapacitating agoraphobia after being attacked and nearly killed by a psychopath who was obsessed with her. However, she can't help getting involved when young women start to get murdered. Helen will soon notice that the crime scenes are exact copies of grimly famous murders by famous serial killers from the past. "Copycat" is not a perfect movie. It does have its weaknesses: some plot lines are clearly superfluous and don't really fit in with the main plot line; there are other scenes which seem to intend to exploit a certain humorous potential about M.J., the female police detective, but don't really fulfill their purpose; and the last third of the movie feels definitely rushed in, as if some significant scenes had been left off at the editing room. I also got the clear feeling that the starting point, the idea behind the story, was not exploited to the fullest, and that a great movie could have come from it. But then, again, "Copycat" is also better than most others in its genre, and I would definitely put it higher than most thrillers that are made these days. Both Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles -I especially enjoyed Hunter's character, a mix of innocence and toughness-, and, even though William McNamara has more modest acting abilities overall, in this role he did a great job. Another good point about "Copycat" is that it respects the pacing and the tempos of a suspenseful movie, with building-up tension and a very good and long climax. My score is 7 stars out of 10.

    When I first started watching this I didn't really think it was up to much. However as it progressed it certainly improved, making the storyline highly addictive. I did find that some points (mostly the agoraphobic scenes) were a little weird and could have been portrayed differently. But this didn't stray from such a strong narrative and perfect performance of Sigourney Weaver. This film isn't a murder mystery, the murderer is clear from very near the beginning of the film, yet they still make the police hunt to finding him a real hook. I would definitely recommend watching this film.

    "For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there is a boy who is tired of pretending to be strong when he feels vulnerable." - Nancy Smith Part of a wave of early to mid 1990s serial killer movies, "Copycat" is a sleazy movie about a respected university professor who begrudgingly helps two San Francisco police detectives track down and apprehend a local serial killer. It's a twist on the "Silence of the Lambs"/"Manhunter" formula, with the caged maverick whom the detectives turn to for assistance being not a demented Hannibal Lecter type locked away in a maximum security prison, but a female expert on serial killers, played by Sigourney Weaver, who confines herself to her high-security apartment because of a traumatic attack which happened several years ago. This is the film's most interesting aspect: Weaver has been driven to agoraphobia by the attack, is now profoundly terrified of human beings, is scared of even opening her front door, and so conducts her entire life from behind a computer screen. Unfortunately the film completely wastes all interesting possibilities afforded by the Sigourney Weaver character. A similar thing happens to a character played by the often excellent Holly Hunter. She's a tough-cookie LA cop  a small gal in a big boy's world  but again her character is completely wasted. The film sets up two interesting female roles only to quickly discard them, using them both as mere cannon fodder. The way Weaver is tortured by serial killers for audience kicks is particularly tawdry. Interestingly, the film's serial killer likes to copy the work of other serial killers, and the film itself contains a string of scenes which copy other serial killer movies, but little is done with this self-referentiality. As with most serial killer films, the serial killer here is awkward, childlike, and gawky around women. As far back as "Peeping Tom", "Night of the Hunter", "Rope", "Psycho" and "Targets", serial killers have been portrayed as being representations of non-phallic sexuality (often their baldness signifies some androgyny or sexual malfunction). In each case the killer seeks to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control, often by specifically targeting women. "Psycho's" Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie. Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are "sexual deviants" is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do.

A psychiatrist who studies serial killers, Helen Hudson (Sigorney Wearver) is attacked in the toilets and almost killed by a psychotic individual named Daryl Lee Cullen (Harry Connick Junior). The trauma leaves her house bound for thirteen years. When a serial killer strikes San Fransisco and she begins by helping out but gets dragged in deeper. As with most thrillers, one has to be careful in revealing the plot because if you know too much the tenseness of the movie can be destroyed. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but not as many as in one like the Color of Night. Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers. Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention. I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason. Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, "I may be in here but I have disciples." Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like. The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

    Above par performances by a good cast couldn't really help the poor script and lazy directing. Sigourney Weaver does a great job as an agoraphobic/paranoid expert on serial killers helping detectives Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney (both of which did fine work portraying believable characters) hunt down a new breed of killer. You'll also find a great performance by Harry Connick Jr. even if he may have stolen his character from Brad Pitt's "Early Grayce" performance two years prior. The film starts out well, establishing both the plot and characters at a decent pace. The opening scene even gives us a good sense of tension, setting the stage for any upcoming suspense. Unfortunately the film tries too hard to show us the various relationships of all the characters (which should be obvious enough to most movie goers) instead of delving into details of the killer and/or killings. This slows the pace of the film too much in my opinion. The film begins with a somewhat original idea, but begins to fill with clich&eacute;s, leading to an end that is as dull as it is silly. Overall, it's not a horrible film. A good watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just don't expect too much. -Fuzzy

    A derivative story and some miscasting along with a few side-bar plot fillers that go nowhere are the flaws that keep this from being an excellent serial killer movie in a nineties serialization of the genre. Holly Hunter as the modern-female lead detective (she drives and her partner is light stepping, easy going and soft spoken) is not really suited for it. The killer part also takes a suspension of disbelief from an actor that is not much of an actor. There are some creepy moments and it moves quickly and Sigourney Weaver's character, while initially irritating, starts to settle in to things and contributes nicely. The crimes are clever and the concept is even more clever if not fully engaged. It is an edge-of-your-seat try with some limited successes but the movie needed some sub-plot rewrites or removal and some main-plot revving.

    "Copycat" is a good and meritful thriller, perhaps one of the best from the 90s, where thrillers were usually more suspenseful and rich in plot lines than packed with action scenes. (This is a compliment). In other words, they don't make them like those thrillers anymore. Therefore, I think "Copycat" deserves the attention of any old-school thriller aficionado. It is less crude than "Silence of the lambs" and, in my opinion, more intelligent, too, but it simply suffered from the fact that it came later in time. "Copycat" is a movie about serial killers and, to a good extent for a commercial-purpose movie, it offers a great deal of information about the psychology and typical rituals of serial killers (apparently, the film-makers recruited world expert Robert K. Ressler for assessment and guidance throughout the making of the movie). There is one serial killer here, too, and one heroine, psychiatrist Helen Hudson, who is fighting incapacitating agoraphobia after being attacked and nearly killed by a psychopath who was obsessed with her. However, she can't help getting involved when young women start to get murdered. Helen will soon notice that the crime scenes are exact copies of grimly famous murders by famous serial killers from the past. "Copycat" is not a perfect movie. It does have its weaknesses: some plot lines are clearly superfluous and don't really fit in with the main plot line; there are other scenes which seem to intend to exploit a certain humorous potential about M.J., the female police detective, but don't really fulfill their purpose; and the last third of the movie feels definitely rushed in, as if some significant scenes had been left off at the editing room. I also got the clear feeling that the starting point, the idea behind the story, was not exploited to the fullest, and that a great movie could have come from it. But then, again, "Copycat" is also better than most others in its genre, and I would definitely put it higher than most thrillers that are made these days. Both Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles -I especially enjoyed Hunter's character, a mix of innocence and toughness-, and, even though William McNamara has more modest acting abilities overall, in this role he did a great job. Another good point about "Copycat" is that it respects the pacing and the tempos of a suspenseful movie, with building-up tension and a very good and long climax. My score is 7 stars out of 10.

    When I first started watching this I didn't really think it was up to much. However as it progressed it certainly improved, making the storyline highly addictive. I did find that some points (mostly the agoraphobic scenes) were a little weird and could have been portrayed differently. But this didn't stray from such a strong narrative and perfect performance of Sigourney Weaver. This film isn't a murder mystery, the murderer is clear from very near the beginning of the film, yet they still make the police hunt to finding him a real hook. I would definitely recommend watching this film.

    "For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there is a boy who is tired of pretending to be strong when he feels vulnerable." - Nancy Smith Part of a wave of early to mid 1990s serial killer movies, "Copycat" is a sleazy movie about a respected university professor who begrudgingly helps two San Francisco police detectives track down and apprehend a local serial killer. It's a twist on the "Silence of the Lambs"/"Manhunter" formula, with the caged maverick whom the detectives turn to for assistance being not a demented Hannibal Lecter type locked away in a maximum security prison, but a female expert on serial killers, played by Sigourney Weaver, who confines herself to her high-security apartment because of a traumatic attack which happened several years ago. This is the film's most interesting aspect: Weaver has been driven to agoraphobia by the attack, is now profoundly terrified of human beings, is scared of even opening her front door, and so conducts her entire life from behind a computer screen. Unfortunately the film completely wastes all interesting possibilities afforded by the Sigourney Weaver character. A similar thing happens to a character played by the often excellent Holly Hunter. She's a tough-cookie LA cop  a small gal in a big boy's world  but again her character is completely wasted. The film sets up two interesting female roles only to quickly discard them, using them both as mere cannon fodder. The way Weaver is tortured by serial killers for audience kicks is particularly tawdry. Interestingly, the film's serial killer likes to copy the work of other serial killers, and the film itself contains a string of scenes which copy other serial killer movies, but little is done with this self-referentiality. As with most serial killer films, the serial killer here is awkward, childlike, and gawky around women. As far back as "Peeping Tom", "Night of the Hunter", "Rope", "Psycho" and "Targets", serial killers have been portrayed as being representations of non-phallic sexuality (often their baldness signifies some androgyny or sexual malfunction). In each case the killer seeks to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control, often by specifically targeting women. "Psycho's" Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie. Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are "sexual deviants" is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do. David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that "it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has". Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he "Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever". In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel: to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity. In "Copycat's" case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. "Masculinity" has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this "weakening", TV shows like "Dexter" portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or "American" drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated. 7/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Criminal profiler and psychologist Dr Helen Hudson becomes entangled in the deadly mind game of a vicious copycat serial killer. Due to the horrific attack Helen suffered in her past as an agoraphobic she is confined to her apartment. The killer uses this against her in his murderous attempts to become a famous serial killer. Detectives M. J Monahan and Reuben Goetz they have the challenge of trying to capture the killer before he kills again and uses his chance to commit another murder.... While th film will win no plaudits for originality or scares, it's still good to see a character driven thriller, rather than one intending to shock with bucket loads of gore and cheap scares. Weaver is great as the Agoraphobic, but it does become quite funny the amount of times she shouts out for her carer at the beginning. The actual story is quite good, but the two 'Tyler Durden' showings of the killer before we meet the character is awful, and just gives the whole game away. Connick Jr is truly great in this, but did he really have to look like the guy from MAD magazine? Even though it's on for more than two hours, it runs at a steady pace, and never really gets boring, thanks to the two leads.

    I would say after watching this movie, go and see the film, Seven by David Fincher. Both films were made in the same year, and follow similar story lines about serial killers. However, where-as in Seven, you have a film that's so dark and depressing that you're drawn in, and the killings, although not witnessed, can actually make you physically sick. The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially "Seven for those with weak stomachs." The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says "hello" to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

    "Copycat" is a tense thriller about the pursuit of a murderer whose declared intention is to "turn murder into art" which he does by recreating the work of some of the great serial killers of the past. Suspense, intrigue and danger are never far away and the well-written screenplay and the lively pace of this movie ensure that it remains totally gripping from start to finish. Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an eminent criminal psychologist and a recognised expert on serial killers. Her knowledge of their methods and motivations is extensive and her books on the subject have achieved great success. After delivering a lecture at a university, she's followed to the ladies' room by one of her previous subjects, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr) who viciously attacks her and leaves her hanging by her neck from a high level over a toilet cubicle. She's soon rescued but the trauma she suffers turns her into an agoraphobic recluse who becomes a virtual prisoner in her own luxury apartment. Some time later, Detective Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and her partner Detective Inspector Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) are investigating a series of murders in the San Francisco area and suspect that they might all be the work of one man. They seek the assistance of Dr Hudson because her specialised knowledge should enable them to track down the killer significantly quicker than they could without her help. Dr Hudson lives in a constant state of fear, suffers regular panic attacks and relies heavily on pills and alcohol to enable her to cope. Nevertheless, she does agree to help and soon recognises that the killer is copying the methods used by previous serial killers. Dr Hudson is able to identify the order in which the murderer is copying the famous serial killers and this proves to be helpful in deducing where he might strike next. She becomes increasingly terrified however, when the murderer starts to contact her via the Internet and both her and Monahan then feel seriously threatened when it becomes apparent that he's targeting them as his next victims. Hudson and Monahan are well-developed characters and the performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter certainly do them justice. Weaver is particularly good at conveying the state of terror in which her character lives whilst at the same time showing that before her breakdown, she was an indomitable and rather arrogant person. Monahan, on the other hand is interesting as a woman who operates successfully in a male dominated environment without losing her femininity. She's both tough and friendly but also secure enough to function in her role without feeling that she has to assume the characteristics of her male colleagues. Harry Connick Jnr is scary and idiosyncratic and provides the most memorable supporting performance in his small but very significant role. "Copycat" begins impressively with an attention grabbing sequence which culminates in the attack on Dr Hudson and then continues to keep the audience's interest high by following Monahan's investigation. The action takes place in an atmosphere that's consistently tense and disturbing and Jon Amiel's direction is exemplary.

    Gripping serial killer thriller that was overshadowed by the release of Se7en a month earlier. Weaver is an agoraphobic psychologist that specialises in serial killers. Holly Hunter is a detective with three similar and unsolved murders on her hands. It soon becomes apparent that these murders are copycat killings. The film is a bit disjointed in its who-done-it first act, before just revealing the killer to the audience. The does eventually work out in the film's favor as it becomes more of a character piece. Patton is wonderful as a jealous ex-lover of Hunter, one that spars verbally with Mulroney, but soon becomes a tragic and sympathetic character. Connick Jr. does well in a batshit bonkers role. The acting and characters carry the movie, even if the material becomes stretched. It's predictable and surprising in equal measure, but contains wonderful moments, such as an unrelated shooting, which intrude on the main plot, but flesh out the characters. Didn't bore me once.
