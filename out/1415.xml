    Strange, utterly needless sequel has Pat Morita returning one last time as Mr. Miyagi. Set several years after Part III, Daniel is off on his own, leaving Miyagi free to instruct another troubled teenager, this time a woman, played by Hillary Swank, who is the granddaughter of his old commanding officer, who is being terrorized in her school by(you guessed it!) bullying martial arts/military cadet students(led by the dependable Michael Ironside) Plot is utterly predictable and uninspired; Miyagi's story was tied to Daniel's so having him instruct this girl is incongruous; it just didn't involve the viewer. Though not as silly as Part III, this is still not credible either, and marks an unfitting end to a story best left alone.

    Having seen the other Karate Kids, I was curious about this film, though I had never seen or even heard of it. The usual elements are back. New kid in town that struggles to adjust; a Mr. Miyagi that helps to instill self-confidence in the teen; and the climax of needing to use the recently learned karate in a pivotal fight scene. I was taken in both by Hilary Swank's character, expressing the range of emotions and soon willing to be positively formed (the Karate Kid characters are always so kinetic, aren't they?) and Mr. Miyagi as the walking book of Oriental proverbs. I loved it! Slow in some parts, but some intriguing scenes.

    When the third came out, I knew they would soon run out of steam. But then I saw the fourth and changed my mind just a little. The Karate Kid 2 managed to entertain me enough without making it seem like the fourth attempt to keep milking the original. In this fourth installment, the boy has left and in place is a girl. She's a teenager and has lost her parents so her attitude and mood are affected by that. However, when the great karate master in the past three films comes to "babysit" for a while, things get tense. At first the girl is annoyed by him as she was her aunt (I believe), however after much time and a trip to see Monks, the girl soon becomes happy. Soon she gets a date to prom and then of course, things get crazy! But that's for you to find out! Anyway, I rate this 7/10.

    Pat Morita, Hilary Swank, Chris Conrad, Constance Towers, and Michael Ironside star in this 1994 drama sequel. In this chapter, Mr. Miyagi (Morita) attends a WWII ceremony in Boston, MA honoring him and his late friend. He visits his friend's widow, Louisa (Towers) and meets her granddaughter, Julie (Swank). He notices that Julie is angry because her parents are dead and takes her anger out on Louisa. He asks Louisa to spend time in his house in California while he helps Julie. He takes Julie her under his wing teaching her karate to defend herself against bullies in school and regain her self-confidence. Julie also meets Eric (Conrad), a boy in school who's a cadet for the air force and they fall for each other. Eric and Julie face the same bullies in league with Col. Dugan (Ironside) who's a war nut. This is a pretty good sequel, Morita and Swank are great together and Bill Conti's score is excellent as usual. I recommend this.

    Now enters the new Karate Kid in a female persona for The Next Karate Kid,also known as The Karate Kid Part IV. After a disastrous Karate Kid Part III,the producers have extended the series to Part IV this time with a new female lead. The Next Karate Kid is the fourth and final film in the original The Karate Kid series. It stars Hilary Swank and Pat Morita. The film was was directed by Christopher Cain and written by Mark Lee.It is the only film in the original series that doesn't feature Ralph Macchio,who played Daniel LaRusso. The story of the film picks up with janitor/martial arts maven Miyagi Yakuga. This time, his pupil is orphaned 17-year-old Julie, the granddaughter of Miyagi's war buddy. Relentlessly bullied by her male classmates and feeling responsible for her parents' fatal accident, Miyagi takes this time to take Julie to a Buddhist monastery in order to teach her the true ways of karate.In here,she learns, through direct lessons, balance, co-ordination, awareness, and respect for all life self-worth.The film ends as we know how when Julie finally takes revenge on the male classmates who used to bully her. The film follows the same formula of the first three sequels using a new prot&eacute;g&eacute;.So there are no surprises in it. It was too long and very predictable.Also,it offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence.The only good thing about this film was the performance of future Academy Award winner,Hilary Swank who made a breakout performance in it.And most of all,it was a little better than the second sequel as this film did not receive any Razzies nomination unlike the latter which got 5. In summary,inspite of the fact that the series tries to infuse a new blood with a new lead,the Karate Kid series has already lost steam and this time,it is evident to put a close into it.

    It had been five years since the third film in the original trilogy, but for some reason they felt like another film with a brand new "kid" would breathe life into the series, Ralph Macchio being grown up of course, I decided to watch it. Basically Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), once an Army Sergeant attends a commemoration for Japanese soldiers who fought in World War II for the US Army in Boston, and there he meets his commanding officer's widow Louisa Pierce (Constance Towers). She then introduces him to her bad tempered and bratty teenage granddaughter Julie Pierce (young Hilary Swank), who lives with the memory of her parents being killed in a car accident. This has caused friction between her and her grandmother, but also with her fellow school students, but she also passes time caring for an injured hawk she has named Angel, kept in the school roof pigeon coop. At school Julie meets and befriends young and kindhearted security guard Eric McGowen (Chris Conrad) who works in the fraternity known as the Alpha Elite, and she also gains an enemy in aggressive student Ned (Michael Cavalieri), both are taught by vicious mentor Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside). She finds herself being horribly bullied by the nasty members of the Alpha Elite, and after revealing that she used to be taught karate to her new friend Mr. Miyagi, he agrees to teach her more moves to defend herself. She learns balance, be co-ordinated, awareness of incoming threat, and to have respect for all life, and she becomes friends with the monks that Mr. Miyagi has helping her. When she returns to school she knows that Angel, who was initially taken by Ned but returned, is able to fly, and they release her into the wild, and is then given a new prom dress from Mr. Miyagi. For some reason there the Alpha Elite are order by Colonel Dugan to bungee jump and enter, and when Julie leaves she and Eric share a kiss, but they also get caught up in a proposed fight on the docks. In the end, Mr. Miyagi is standing back to let Julie use her newfound karate skills to defend herself in the fight with Ned who is encouraged by Colonel Dugan, of course she wins. Also starring Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot and Walton Goggins as Charlie. It is nice to still have Morita returning for his most famous and once Oscar nominated character, and young double future Oscar winner Swank does alright as the new female karate kid, but the film is let down by the same old same old plot, nothing new to be seen really, not a original or highly interesting martial arts adventure. Okay!

    I cant believe that some people gave this such high marks! First off, I have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls. The principal OVERHEARS the head thug bullying Julie into meeting him "at the docks...most girls have to BEG me for an invitation, and you're turning Me down?!?!" Yet, even though he OVERHEARS this and SEES the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork, the Principal STILL sends HER to the office?!? Yea, right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents. It appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. He says "If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it" Yea, RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent. The coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight. This is okay? My FAVORITE, though, was the coach telling his "gang" to blow up that dudes car.This whole thing was a joke. The thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says "MEET ME AT THE DOCKS" OK, see, Id go inside Julies house, pick up the phone, call the cops and SAY" Some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if I was brave enough" Then, let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep, and arrest his butt. This movie was just lame.

    Ugh. Just thinking about this movie makes my stomach churn. This has got to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie franchise sequel that I have ever scene. This fourth installment of the "Karate Kid" movies is so bad it makes "Police Acadamy 4" look like an Oscar contender. I know at the time Hillary Swank was just starting out and had to take whatever she could get as an actress, so she has a somewhat valid excuse. However, Pat Morita should have given more thought about this script before signing on. After all the character of "Myagi" was the best of his career and he should have been more protective of this beloved character. I think where this movie suffers the most is just in the lame writing. The story is just so out to lunch and feels so amateurish that you cant wonder who were the hacks brought in to write it? Give you an example, the scene where Swank firsts meets Myagi. Swanks supposed guardian or maybe it was her grandmother, cant remember, tries to introduce them. She walks away in a huff and says "My name is Julie and I came here to live because my mother was killed in a traffic accident 6 months ago." I mean wow. It was so blatantly absurd. Talk about having a plot point thrown in your face and dangled. My jaw dropped to floor after hearing that and the movie just goes down hill from there. Skip this movie.....skip, skip skip.

    When Eric fought Ned on the school roof he easily defeated him, but when he later fought Ned in the street at night he easily lost. Contrived plot loss so that Julie could step up. Film was disappointing because the title "The Next Karate Kid" implied the showcasing of some good fight scenes for the protagonist (Julie) like there were in the culminating scenes of the first movie, Karate Kid's "All Valley Tournament", but there were none. Disappointing. There was only Julie too quickly (and too easily) defeating Ned after, of course, Miyagi issued his obligatory trademark "focus!" advice to her. One wishes he'd said that to the writers and director during pre-production. All in all, the movie lacks cohesiveness and plays more like a series of dramatic skits. And who chose Miss Swank's hair style? Really, it looked like a long-eared Labrador. That look went out somewhere in the 70's. Her character didn't even change it for the one of the biggest events of most teens like, their Prom. Somewhere in the final credits there should've been this from the producer: "Thank you for buying a ticket. We got your money and you got a third rate movie".

    (Credit IMDb) During a commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II Mr. Miyagi meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaughter Julie, an angry teenager. She is full of pain about the death of her parents during an accident and has lots of problems with her grandmother and her fellow pupils. So Mr. Miyagi decides to teach her Karate to bring her back on the right way Ralph Machio's (Excuse the spelling) career had faltered at this point, aside from late hit with My Cousin Vinny, so he was no longer considered the bankable star he once was. A successful formula is repeated here, with this basically being a watered down remake of the first. Hillary Swank's star appeal had yet to be established here, but she certainly showed many flashes with her charismatic performance here. I enjoyed the relationship between Miyagi and Julie, it was genuine and a good attempt at reviving this series. What really hampered this movie was the generic storytelling of the villains. They had no depth to them, and they just felt like ordinary bad-guy foil for Julie and Miyagi to overcome. I liked some of the meditation scenes, I enjoyed Miyagi taking Julie see the monks, there was a lot more enjoyable stuff then 3.9 rating indicates. Training scenes could have been better developed, using a girl wasn't as effective as Daniel's, but hey, what can you do? Performances. Pat Morita carries this film with his presence and style. He deserved a better film, but at least he wasn't in a horrible one. He has good chemistry with Swank, and I believed in them both. You can't go wrong with the patented Miyagi. Hilary Swank is charming, and pretty cute to boot. She showed a lot of snippets here of her amazing talent that was to become. Lot of similar, successful traits that Daniel (Machio) had to make the character successful in the first three. Michael Ironside is a great villain, but is going through the motions here, and he has no depth to him. Chris Conrad is rather cheesy, and wooden as the love interest. Bottom line. Far from a successful film, but it definitely had a few moments that made me smile. Believe me; you can do a whole lot worse then The Next Karate Kid. 3.9? Come on, I've seen a lot worse with higher ratings. It's worth a look, but nothing more then that 5/10

After all the character of "Myagi" was the best of his career and he should have been more protective of this beloved character. I think where this movie suffers the most is just in the lame writing. The story is just so out to lunch and feels so amateurish that you cant wonder who were the hacks brought in to write it? Give you an example, the scene where Swank firsts meets Myagi. Swanks supposed guardian or maybe it was her grandmother, cant remember, tries to introduce them. She walks away in a huff and says "My name is Julie and I came here to live because my mother was killed in a traffic accident 6 months ago." I mean wow. It was so blatantly absurd. Talk about having a plot point thrown in your face and dangled. My jaw dropped to floor after hearing that and the movie just goes down hill from there. Skip this movie.....skip, skip skip.

    When Eric fought Ned on the school roof he easily defeated him, but when he later fought Ned in the street at night he easily lost. Contrived plot loss so that Julie could step up. Film was disappointing because the title "The Next Karate Kid" implied the showcasing of some good fight scenes for the protagonist (Julie) like there were in the culminating scenes of the first movie, Karate Kid's "All Valley Tournament", but there were none. Disappointing. There was only Julie too quickly (and too easily) defeating Ned after, of course, Miyagi issued his obligatory trademark "focus!" advice to her. One wishes he'd said that to the writers and director during pre-production. All in all, the movie lacks cohesiveness and plays more like a series of dramatic skits. And who chose Miss Swank's hair style? Really, it looked like a long-eared Labrador. That look went out somewhere in the 70's. Her character didn't even change it for the one of the biggest events of most teens like, their Prom. Somewhere in the final credits there should've been this from the producer: "Thank you for buying a ticket. We got your money and you got a third rate movie".

    (Credit IMDb) During a commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II Mr. Miyagi meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaughter Julie, an angry teenager. She is full of pain about the death of her parents during an accident and has lots of problems with her grandmother and her fellow pupils. So Mr. Miyagi decides to teach her Karate to bring her back on the right way Ralph Machio's (Excuse the spelling) career had faltered at this point, aside from late hit with My Cousin Vinny, so he was no longer considered the bankable star he once was. A successful formula is repeated here, with this basically being a watered down remake of the first. Hillary Swank's star appeal had yet to be established here, but she certainly showed many flashes with her charismatic performance here. I enjoyed the relationship between Miyagi and Julie, it was genuine and a good attempt at reviving this series. What really hampered this movie was the generic storytelling of the villains. They had no depth to them, and they just felt like ordinary bad-guy foil for Julie and Miyagi to overcome. I liked some of the meditation scenes, I enjoyed Miyagi taking Julie see the monks, there was a lot more enjoyable stuff then 3.9 rating indicates. Training scenes could have been better developed, using a girl wasn't as effective as Daniel's, but hey, what can you do? Performances. Pat Morita carries this film with his presence and style. He deserved a better film, but at least he wasn't in a horrible one. He has good chemistry with Swank, and I believed in them both. You can't go wrong with the patented Miyagi. Hilary Swank is charming, and pretty cute to boot. She showed a lot of snippets here of her amazing talent that was to become. Lot of similar, successful traits that Daniel (Machio) had to make the character successful in the first three. Michael Ironside is a great villain, but is going through the motions here, and he has no depth to him. Chris Conrad is rather cheesy, and wooden as the love interest. Bottom line. Far from a successful film, but it definitely had a few moments that made me smile. Believe me; you can do a whole lot worse then The Next Karate Kid. 3.9? Come on, I've seen a lot worse with higher ratings. It's worth a look, but nothing more then that 5/10

    Strange, utterly needless sequel has Pat Morita returning one last time as Mr. Miyagi. Set several years after Part III, Daniel is off on his own, leaving Miyagi free to instruct another troubled teenager, this time a woman, played by Hillary Swank, who is the granddaughter of his old commanding officer, who is being terrorized in her school by(you guessed it!) bullying martial arts/military cadet students(led by the dependable Michael Ironside) Plot is utterly predictable and uninspired; Miyagi's story was tied to Daniel's so having him instruct this girl is incongruous; it just didn't involve the viewer. Though not as silly as Part III, this is still not credible either, and marks an unfitting end to a story best left alone.

    Having seen the other Karate Kids, I was curious about this film, though I had never seen or even heard of it. The usual elements are back. New kid in town that struggles to adjust; a Mr. Miyagi that helps to instill self-confidence in the teen; and the climax of needing to use the recently learned karate in a pivotal fight scene. I was taken in both by Hilary Swank's character, expressing the range of emotions and soon willing to be positively formed (the Karate Kid characters are always so kinetic, aren't they?) and Mr. Miyagi as the walking book of Oriental proverbs. I loved it! Slow in some parts, but some intriguing scenes.

    When the third came out, I knew they would soon run out of steam. But then I saw the fourth and changed my mind just a little. The Karate Kid 2 managed to entertain me enough without making it seem like the fourth attempt to keep milking the original. In this fourth installment, the boy has left and in place is a girl. She's a teenager and has lost her parents so her attitude and mood are affected by that. However, when the great karate master in the past three films comes to "babysit" for a while, things get tense. At first the girl is annoyed by him as she was her aunt (I believe), however after much time and a trip to see Monks, the girl soon becomes happy. Soon she gets a date to prom and then of course, things get crazy! But that's for you to find out! Anyway, I rate this 7/10.

    Pat Morita, Hilary Swank, Chris Conrad, Constance Towers, and Michael Ironside star in this 1994 drama sequel. In this chapter, Mr. Miyagi (Morita) attends a WWII ceremony in Boston, MA honoring him and his late friend. He visits his friend's widow, Louisa (Towers) and meets her granddaughter, Julie (Swank). He notices that Julie is angry because her parents are dead and takes her anger out on Louisa. He asks Louisa to spend time in his house in California while he helps Julie. He takes Julie her under his wing teaching her karate to defend herself against bullies in school and regain her self-confidence. Julie also meets Eric (Conrad), a boy in school who's a cadet for the air force and they fall for each other. Eric and Julie face the same bullies in league with Col. Dugan (Ironside) who's a war nut. This is a pretty good sequel, Morita and Swank are great together and Bill Conti's score is excellent as usual. I recommend this.

    Now enters the new Karate Kid in a female persona for The Next Karate Kid,also known as The Karate Kid Part IV. After a disastrous Karate Kid Part III,the producers have extended the series to Part IV this time with a new female lead. The Next Karate Kid is the fourth and final film in the original The Karate Kid series. It stars Hilary Swank and Pat Morita. The film was was directed by Christopher Cain and written by Mark Lee.It is the only film in the original series that doesn't feature Ralph Macchio,who played Daniel LaRusso. The story of the film picks up with janitor/martial arts maven Miyagi Yakuga. This time, his pupil is orphaned 17-year-old Julie, the granddaughter of Miyagi's war buddy. Relentlessly bullied by her male classmates and feeling responsible for her parents' fatal accident, Miyagi takes this time to take Julie to a Buddhist monastery in order to teach her the true ways of karate.In here,she learns, through direct lessons, balance, co-ordination, awareness, and respect for all life self-worth.The film ends as we know how when Julie finally takes revenge on the male classmates who used to bully her. The film follows the same formula of the first three sequels using a new prot&eacute;g&eacute;.So there are no surprises in it. It was too long and very predictable.Also,it offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence.The only good thing about this film was the performance of future Academy Award winner,Hilary Swank who made a breakout performance in it.And most of all,it was a little better than the second sequel as this film did not receive any Razzies nomination unlike the latter which got 5. In summary,inspite of the fact that the series tries to infuse a new blood with a new lead,the Karate Kid series has already lost steam and this time,it is evident to put a close into it.

    It had been five years since the third film in the original trilogy, but for some reason they felt like another film with a brand new "kid" would breathe life into the series, Ralph Macchio being grown up of course, I decided to watch it. Basically Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), once an Army Sergeant attends a commemoration for Japanese soldiers who fought in World War II for the US Army in Boston, and there he meets his commanding officer's widow Louisa Pierce (Constance Towers). She then introduces him to her bad tempered and bratty teenage granddaughter Julie Pierce (young Hilary Swank), who lives with the memory of her parents being killed in a car accident. This has caused friction between her and her grandmother, but also with her fellow school students, but she also passes time caring for an injured hawk she has named Angel, kept in the school roof pigeon coop. At school Julie meets and befriends young and kindhearted security guard Eric McGowen (Chris Conrad) who works in the fraternity known as the Alpha Elite, and she also gains an enemy in aggressive student Ned (Michael Cavalieri), both are taught by vicious mentor Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside). She finds herself being horribly bullied by the nasty members of the Alpha Elite, and after revealing that she used to be taught karate to her new friend Mr. Miyagi, he agrees to teach her more moves to defend herself. She learns balance, be co-ordinated, awareness of incoming threat, and to have respect for all life, and she becomes friends with the monks that Mr. Miyagi has helping her. When she returns to school she knows that Angel, who was initially taken by Ned but returned, is able to fly, and they release her into the wild, and is then given a new prom dress from Mr. Miyagi. For some reason there the Alpha Elite are order by Colonel Dugan to bungee jump and enter, and when Julie leaves she and Eric share a kiss, but they also get caught up in a proposed fight on the docks. In the end, Mr. Miyagi is standing back to let Julie use her newfound karate skills to defend herself in the fight with Ned who is encouraged by Colonel Dugan, of course she wins. Also starring Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot and Walton Goggins as Charlie. It is nice to still have Morita returning for his most famous and once Oscar nominated character, and young double future Oscar winner Swank does alright as the new female karate kid, but the film is let down by the same old same old plot, nothing new to be seen really, not a original or highly interesting martial arts adventure. Okay!

    I cant believe that some people gave this such high marks! First off, I have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls. The principal OVERHEARS the head thug bullying Julie into meeting him "at the docks...most girls have to BEG me for an invitation, and you're turning Me down?!?!" Yet, even though he OVERHEARS this and SEES the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork, the Principal STILL sends HER to the office?!? Yea, right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents. It appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. He says "If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it" Yea, RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent. The coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight. This is okay? My FAVORITE, though, was the coach telling his "gang" to blow up that dudes car.This whole thing was a joke. The thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says "MEET ME AT THE DOCKS" OK, see, Id go inside Julies house, pick up the phone, call the cops and SAY" Some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if I was brave enough" Then, let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep, and arrest his butt. This movie was just lame.

    Ugh. Just thinking about this movie makes my stomach churn. This has got to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie franchise sequel that I have ever scene. This fourth installment of the "Karate Kid" movies is so bad it makes "Police Acadamy 4" look like an Oscar contender. I know at the time Hillary Swank was just starting out and had to take whatever she could get as an actress, so she has a somewhat valid excuse. However, Pat Morita should have given more thought about this script before signing on. After all the character of "Myagi" was the best of his career and he should have been more protective of this beloved character. I think where this movie suffers the most is just in the lame writing. The story is just so out to lunch and feels so amateurish that you cant wonder who were the hacks brought in to write it? Give you an example, the scene where Swank firsts meets Myagi. Swanks supposed guardian or maybe it was her grandmother, cant remember, tries to introduce them. She walks away in a huff and says "My name is Julie and I came here to live because my mother was killed in a traffic accident 6 months ago." I mean wow. It was so blatantly absurd. Talk about having a plot point thrown in your face and dangled. My jaw dropped to floor after hearing that and the movie just goes down hill from there. Skip this movie.....skip, skip skip.

One wishes he'd said that to the writers and director during pre-production. All in all, the movie lacks cohesiveness and plays more like a series of dramatic skits. And who chose Miss Swank's hair style? Really, it looked like a long-eared Labrador. That look went out somewhere in the 70's. Her character didn't even change it for the one of the biggest events of most teens like, their Prom. Somewhere in the final credits there should've been this from the producer: "Thank you for buying a ticket. We got your money and you got a third rate movie".

    I cant believe that some people gave this such high marks! First off, I have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls. The principal OVERHEARS the head thug bullying Julie into meeting him "at the docks...most girls have to BEG me for an invitation, and you're turning Me down?!?!" Yet, even though he OVERHEARS this and SEES the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork, the Principal STILL sends HER to the office?!? Yea, right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents. It appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. He says "If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it" Yea, RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent. The coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight. This is okay? My FAVORITE, though, was the coach telling his "gang" to blow up that dudes car.This whole thing was a joke. The thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says "MEET ME AT THE DOCKS" OK, see, Id go inside Julies house, pick up the phone, call the cops and SAY" Some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if I was brave enough" Then, let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep, and arrest his butt. This movie was just lame.

    Ugh. Just thinking about this movie makes my stomach churn. This has got to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie franchise sequel that I have ever scene. This fourth installment of the "Karate Kid" movies is so bad it makes "Police Acadamy 4" look like an Oscar contender. I know at the time Hillary Swank was just starting out and had to take whatever she could get as an actress, so she has a somewhat valid excuse. However, Pat Morita should have given more thought about this script before signing on. After all the character of "Myagi" was the best of his career and he should have been more protective of this beloved character. I think where this movie suffers the most is just in the lame writing. The story is just so out to lunch and feels so amateurish that you cant wonder who were the hacks brought in to write it? Give you an example, the scene where Swank firsts meets Myagi. Swanks supposed guardian or maybe it was her grandmother, cant remember, tries to introduce them. She walks away in a huff and says "My name is Julie and I came here to live because my mother was killed in a traffic accident 6 months ago." I mean wow. It was so blatantly absurd. Talk about having a plot point thrown in your face and dangled. My jaw dropped to floor after hearing that and the movie just goes down hill from there. Skip this movie.....skip, skip skip.

    When Eric fought Ned on the school roof he easily defeated him, but when he later fought Ned in the street at night he easily lost. Contrived plot loss so that Julie could step up. Film was disappointing because the title "The Next Karate Kid" implied the showcasing of some good fight scenes for the protagonist (Julie) like there were in the culminating scenes of the first movie, Karate Kid's "All Valley Tournament", but there were none. Disappointing. There was only Julie too quickly (and too easily) defeating Ned after, of course, Miyagi issued his obligatory trademark "focus!" advice to her. One wishes he'd said that to the writers and director during pre-production. All in all, the movie lacks cohesiveness and plays more like a series of dramatic skits. And who chose Miss Swank's hair style? Really, it looked like a long-eared Labrador. That look went out somewhere in the 70's. Her character didn't even change it for the one of the biggest events of most teens like, their Prom. Somewhere in the final credits there should've been this from the producer: "Thank you for buying a ticket. We got your money and you got a third rate movie".

    (Credit IMDb) During a commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II Mr. Miyagi meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaughter Julie, an angry teenager. She is full of pain about the death of her parents during an accident and has lots of problems with her grandmother and her fellow pupils. So Mr. Miyagi decides to teach her Karate to bring her back on the right way Ralph Machio's (Excuse the spelling) career had faltered at this point, aside from late hit with My Cousin Vinny, so he was no longer considered the bankable star he once was. A successful formula is repeated here, with this basically being a watered down remake of the first. Hillary Swank's star appeal had yet to be established here, but she certainly showed many flashes with her charismatic performance here. I enjoyed the relationship between Miyagi and Julie, it was genuine and a good attempt at reviving this series. What really hampered this movie was the generic storytelling of the villains. They had no depth to them, and they just felt like ordinary bad-guy foil for Julie and Miyagi to overcome. I liked some of the meditation scenes, I enjoyed Miyagi taking Julie see the monks, there was a lot more enjoyable stuff then 3.9 rating indicates. Training scenes could have been better developed, using a girl wasn't as effective as Daniel's, but hey, what can you do? Performances. Pat Morita carries this film with his presence and style. He deserved a better film, but at least he wasn't in a horrible one. He has good chemistry with Swank, and I believed in them both. You can't go wrong with the patented Miyagi. Hilary Swank is charming, and pretty cute to boot. She showed a lot of snippets here of her amazing talent that was to become. Lot of similar, successful traits that Daniel (Machio) had to make the character successful in the first three. Michael Ironside is a great villain, but is going through the motions here, and he has no depth to him. Chris Conrad is rather cheesy, and wooden as the love interest. Bottom line. Far from a successful film, but it definitely had a few moments that made me smile. Believe me; you can do a whole lot worse then The Next Karate Kid. 3.9? Come on, I've seen a lot worse with higher ratings. It's worth a look, but nothing more then that 5/10

    Strange, utterly needless sequel has Pat Morita returning one last time as Mr. Miyagi. Set several years after Part III, Daniel is off on his own, leaving Miyagi free to instruct another troubled teenager, this time a woman, played by Hillary Swank, who is the granddaughter of his old commanding officer, who is being terrorized in her school by(you guessed it!) bullying martial arts/military cadet students(led by the dependable Michael Ironside) Plot is utterly predictable and uninspired; Miyagi's story was tied to Daniel's so having him instruct this girl is incongruous; it just didn't involve the viewer. Though not as silly as Part III, this is still not credible either, and marks an unfitting end to a story best left alone.

    Having seen the other Karate Kids, I was curious about this film, though I had never seen or even heard of it. The usual elements are back. New kid in town that struggles to adjust; a Mr. Miyagi that helps to instill self-confidence in the teen; and the climax of needing to use the recently learned karate in a pivotal fight scene. I was taken in both by Hilary Swank's character, expressing the range of emotions and soon willing to be positively formed (the Karate Kid characters are always so kinetic, aren't they?) and Mr. Miyagi as the walking book of Oriental proverbs. I loved it! Slow in some parts, but some intriguing scenes.

    When the third came out, I knew they would soon run out of steam. But then I saw the fourth and changed my mind just a little. The Karate Kid 2 managed to entertain me enough without making it seem like the fourth attempt to keep milking the original. In this fourth installment, the boy has left and in place is a girl. She's a teenager and has lost her parents so her attitude and mood are affected by that. However, when the great karate master in the past three films comes to "babysit" for a while, things get tense. At first the girl is annoyed by him as she was her aunt (I believe), however after much time and a trip to see Monks, the girl soon becomes happy. Soon she gets a date to prom and then of course, things get crazy! But that's for you to find out! Anyway, I rate this 7/10.

    Pat Morita, Hilary Swank, Chris Conrad, Constance Towers, and Michael Ironside star in this 1994 drama sequel. In this chapter, Mr. Miyagi (Morita) attends a WWII ceremony in Boston, MA honoring him and his late friend. He visits his friend's widow, Louisa (Towers) and meets her granddaughter, Julie (Swank). He notices that Julie is angry because her parents are dead and takes her anger out on Louisa. He asks Louisa to spend time in his house in California while he helps Julie. He takes Julie her under his wing teaching her karate to defend herself against bullies in school and regain her self-confidence. Julie also meets Eric (Conrad), a boy in school who's a cadet for the air force and they fall for each other. Eric and Julie face the same bullies in league with Col. Dugan (Ironside) who's a war nut. This is a pretty good sequel, Morita and Swank are great together and Bill Conti's score is excellent as usual. I recommend this.

    Now enters the new Karate Kid in a female persona for The Next Karate Kid,also known as The Karate Kid Part IV. After a disastrous Karate Kid Part III,the producers have extended the series to Part IV this time with a new female lead. The Next Karate Kid is the fourth and final film in the original The Karate Kid series. It stars Hilary Swank and Pat Morita. The film was was directed by Christopher Cain and written by Mark Lee.It is the only film in the original series that doesn't feature Ralph Macchio,who played Daniel LaRusso. The story of the film picks up with janitor/martial arts maven Miyagi Yakuga. This time, his pupil is orphaned 17-year-old Julie, the granddaughter of Miyagi's war buddy. Relentlessly bullied by her male classmates and feeling responsible for her parents' fatal accident, Miyagi takes this time to take Julie to a Buddhist monastery in order to teach her the true ways of karate.In here,she learns, through direct lessons, balance, co-ordination, awareness, and respect for all life self-worth.The film ends as we know how when Julie finally takes revenge on the male classmates who used to bully her. The film follows the same formula of the first three sequels using a new prot&eacute;g&eacute;.So there are no surprises in it. It was too long and very predictable.Also,it offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence.The only good thing about this film was the performance of future Academy Award winner,Hilary Swank who made a breakout performance in it.And most of all,it was a little better than the second sequel as this film did not receive any Razzies nomination unlike the latter which got 5. In summary,inspite of the fact that the series tries to infuse a new blood with a new lead,the Karate Kid series has already lost steam and this time,it is evident to put a close into it.

    It had been five years since the third film in the original trilogy, but for some reason they felt like another film with a brand new "kid" would breathe life into the series, Ralph Macchio being grown up of course, I decided to watch it. Basically Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), once an Army Sergeant attends a commemoration for Japanese soldiers who fought in World War II for the US Army in Boston, and there he meets his commanding officer's widow Louisa Pierce (Constance Towers). She then introduces him to her bad tempered and bratty teenage granddaughter Julie Pierce (young Hilary Swank), who lives with the memory of her parents being killed in a car accident. This has caused friction between her and her grandmother, but also with her fellow school students, but she also passes time caring for an injured hawk she has named Angel, kept in the school roof pigeon coop. At school Julie meets and befriends young and kindhearted security guard Eric McGowen (Chris Conrad) who works in the fraternity known as the Alpha Elite, and she also gains an enemy in aggressive student Ned (Michael Cavalieri), both are taught by vicious mentor Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside). She finds herself being horribly bullied by the nasty members of the Alpha Elite, and after revealing that she used to be taught karate to her new friend Mr. Miyagi, he agrees to teach her more moves to defend herself. She learns balance, be co-ordinated, awareness of incoming threat, and to have respect for all life, and she becomes friends with the monks that Mr. Miyagi has helping her. When she returns to school she knows that Angel, who was initially taken by Ned but returned, is able to fly, and they release her into the wild, and is then given a new prom dress from Mr. Miyagi. For some reason there the Alpha Elite are order by Colonel Dugan to bungee jump and enter, and when Julie leaves she and Eric share a kiss, but they also get caught up in a proposed fight on the docks. In the end, Mr. Miyagi is standing back to let Julie use her newfound karate skills to defend herself in the fight with Ned who is encouraged by Colonel Dugan, of course she wins. Also starring Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot and Walton Goggins as Charlie. It is nice to still have Morita returning for his most famous and once Oscar nominated character, and young double future Oscar winner Swank does alright as the new female karate kid, but the film is let down by the same old same old plot, nothing new to be seen really, not a original or highly interesting martial arts adventure. Okay!

    I cant believe that some people gave this such high marks! First off, I have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls. The principal OVERHEARS the head thug bullying Julie into meeting him "at the docks...most girls have to BEG me for an invitation, and you're turning Me down?!?!" Yet, even though he OVERHEARS this and SEES the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork, the Principal STILL sends HER to the office?!? Yea, right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents. It appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. He says "If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it" Yea, RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent. The coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight. This is okay? My FAVORITE, though, was the coach telling his "gang" to blow up that dudes car.This whole thing was a joke. The thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says "MEET ME AT THE DOCKS" OK, see, Id go inside Julies house, pick up the phone, call the cops and SAY" Some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if I was brave enough" Then, let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep, and arrest his butt. This movie was just lame.

The story is just so out to lunch and feels so amateurish that you cant wonder who were the hacks brought in to write it? Give you an example, the scene where Swank firsts meets Myagi. Swanks supposed guardian or maybe it was her grandmother, cant remember, tries to introduce them. She walks away in a huff and says "My name is Julie and I came here to live because my mother was killed in a traffic accident 6 months ago." I mean wow. It was so blatantly absurd. Talk about having a plot point thrown in your face and dangled. My jaw dropped to floor after hearing that and the movie just goes down hill from there. Skip this movie.....skip, skip skip.

    It had been five years since the third film in the original trilogy, but for some reason they felt like another film with a brand new "kid" would breathe life into the series, Ralph Macchio being grown up of course, I decided to watch it. Basically Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), once an Army Sergeant attends a commemoration for Japanese soldiers who fought in World War II for the US Army in Boston, and there he meets his commanding officer's widow Louisa Pierce (Constance Towers). She then introduces him to her bad tempered and bratty teenage granddaughter Julie Pierce (young Hilary Swank), who lives with the memory of her parents being killed in a car accident. This has caused friction between her and her grandmother, but also with her fellow school students, but she also passes time caring for an injured hawk she has named Angel, kept in the school roof pigeon coop. At school Julie meets and befriends young and kindhearted security guard Eric McGowen (Chris Conrad) who works in the fraternity known as the Alpha Elite, and she also gains an enemy in aggressive student Ned (Michael Cavalieri), both are taught by vicious mentor Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside). She finds herself being horribly bullied by the nasty members of the Alpha Elite, and after revealing that she used to be taught karate to her new friend Mr. Miyagi, he agrees to teach her more moves to defend herself. She learns balance, be co-ordinated, awareness of incoming threat, and to have respect for all life, and she becomes friends with the monks that Mr. Miyagi has helping her. When she returns to school she knows that Angel, who was initially taken by Ned but returned, is able to fly, and they release her into the wild, and is then given a new prom dress from Mr. Miyagi. For some reason there the Alpha Elite are order by Colonel Dugan to bungee jump and enter, and when Julie leaves she and Eric share a kiss, but they also get caught up in a proposed fight on the docks. In the end, Mr. Miyagi is standing back to let Julie use her newfound karate skills to defend herself in the fight with Ned who is encouraged by Colonel Dugan, of course she wins. Also starring Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot and Walton Goggins as Charlie. It is nice to still have Morita returning for his most famous and once Oscar nominated character, and young double future Oscar winner Swank does alright as the new female karate kid, but the film is let down by the same old same old plot, nothing new to be seen really, not a original or highly interesting martial arts adventure. Okay!

    I cant believe that some people gave this such high marks! First off, I have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls. The principal OVERHEARS the head thug bullying Julie into meeting him "at the docks...most girls have to BEG me for an invitation, and you're turning Me down?!?!" Yet, even though he OVERHEARS this and SEES the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork, the Principal STILL sends HER to the office?!? Yea, right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents. It appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. He says "If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it" Yea, RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent. The coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight. This is okay? My FAVORITE, though, was the coach telling his "gang" to blow up that dudes car.This whole thing was a joke. The thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says "MEET ME AT THE DOCKS" OK, see, Id go inside Julies house, pick up the phone, call the cops and SAY" Some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if I was brave enough" Then, let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep, and arrest his butt. This movie was just lame.

    Ugh. Just thinking about this movie makes my stomach churn. This has got to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie franchise sequel that I have ever scene. This fourth installment of the "Karate Kid" movies is so bad it makes "Police Acadamy 4" look like an Oscar contender. I know at the time Hillary Swank was just starting out and had to take whatever she could get as an actress, so she has a somewhat valid excuse. However, Pat Morita should have given more thought about this script before signing on. After all the character of "Myagi" was the best of his career and he should have been more protective of this beloved character. I think where this movie suffers the most is just in the lame writing. The story is just so out to lunch and feels so amateurish that you cant wonder who were the hacks brought in to write it? Give you an example, the scene where Swank firsts meets Myagi. Swanks supposed guardian or maybe it was her grandmother, cant remember, tries to introduce them. She walks away in a huff and says "My name is Julie and I came here to live because my mother was killed in a traffic accident 6 months ago." I mean wow. It was so blatantly absurd. Talk about having a plot point thrown in your face and dangled. My jaw dropped to floor after hearing that and the movie just goes down hill from there. Skip this movie.....skip, skip skip.

    When Eric fought Ned on the school roof he easily defeated him, but when he later fought Ned in the street at night he easily lost. Contrived plot loss so that Julie could step up. Film was disappointing because the title "The Next Karate Kid" implied the showcasing of some good fight scenes for the protagonist (Julie) like there were in the culminating scenes of the first movie, Karate Kid's "All Valley Tournament", but there were none. Disappointing. There was only Julie too quickly (and too easily) defeating Ned after, of course, Miyagi issued his obligatory trademark "focus!" advice to her. One wishes he'd said that to the writers and director during pre-production. All in all, the movie lacks cohesiveness and plays more like a series of dramatic skits. And who chose Miss Swank's hair style? Really, it looked like a long-eared Labrador. That look went out somewhere in the 70's. Her character didn't even change it for the one of the biggest events of most teens like, their Prom. Somewhere in the final credits there should've been this from the producer: "Thank you for buying a ticket. We got your money and you got a third rate movie".

    (Credit IMDb) During a commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II Mr. Miyagi meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaughter Julie, an angry teenager. She is full of pain about the death of her parents during an accident and has lots of problems with her grandmother and her fellow pupils. So Mr. Miyagi decides to teach her Karate to bring her back on the right way Ralph Machio's (Excuse the spelling) career had faltered at this point, aside from late hit with My Cousin Vinny, so he was no longer considered the bankable star he once was. A successful formula is repeated here, with this basically being a watered down remake of the first. Hillary Swank's star appeal had yet to be established here, but she certainly showed many flashes with her charismatic performance here. I enjoyed the relationship between Miyagi and Julie, it was genuine and a good attempt at reviving this series. What really hampered this movie was the generic storytelling of the villains. They had no depth to them, and they just felt like ordinary bad-guy foil for Julie and Miyagi to overcome. I liked some of the meditation scenes, I enjoyed Miyagi taking Julie see the monks, there was a lot more enjoyable stuff then 3.9 rating indicates. Training scenes could have been better developed, using a girl wasn't as effective as Daniel's, but hey, what can you do? Performances. Pat Morita carries this film with his presence and style. He deserved a better film, but at least he wasn't in a horrible one. He has good chemistry with Swank, and I believed in them both. You can't go wrong with the patented Miyagi. Hilary Swank is charming, and pretty cute to boot. She showed a lot of snippets here of her amazing talent that was to become. Lot of similar, successful traits that Daniel (Machio) had to make the character successful in the first three. Michael Ironside is a great villain, but is going through the motions here, and he has no depth to him. Chris Conrad is rather cheesy, and wooden as the love interest. Bottom line. Far from a successful film, but it definitely had a few moments that made me smile. Believe me; you can do a whole lot worse then The Next Karate Kid. 3.9? Come on, I've seen a lot worse with higher ratings. It's worth a look, but nothing more then that 5/10

    Strange, utterly needless sequel has Pat Morita returning one last time as Mr. Miyagi. Set several years after Part III, Daniel is off on his own, leaving Miyagi free to instruct another troubled teenager, this time a woman, played by Hillary Swank, who is the granddaughter of his old commanding officer, who is being terrorized in her school by(you guessed it!) bullying martial arts/military cadet students(led by the dependable Michael Ironside) Plot is utterly predictable and uninspired; Miyagi's story was tied to Daniel's so having him instruct this girl is incongruous; it just didn't involve the viewer. Though not as silly as Part III, this is still not credible either, and marks an unfitting end to a story best left alone.

    Having seen the other Karate Kids, I was curious about this film, though I had never seen or even heard of it. The usual elements are back. New kid in town that struggles to adjust; a Mr. Miyagi that helps to instill self-confidence in the teen; and the climax of needing to use the recently learned karate in a pivotal fight scene. I was taken in both by Hilary Swank's character, expressing the range of emotions and soon willing to be positively formed (the Karate Kid characters are always so kinetic, aren't they?) and Mr. Miyagi as the walking book of Oriental proverbs. I loved it! Slow in some parts, but some intriguing scenes.

    When the third came out, I knew they would soon run out of steam. But then I saw the fourth and changed my mind just a little. The Karate Kid 2 managed to entertain me enough without making it seem like the fourth attempt to keep milking the original. In this fourth installment, the boy has left and in place is a girl. She's a teenager and has lost her parents so her attitude and mood are affected by that. However, when the great karate master in the past three films comes to "babysit" for a while, things get tense. At first the girl is annoyed by him as she was her aunt (I believe), however after much time and a trip to see Monks, the girl soon becomes happy. Soon she gets a date to prom and then of course, things get crazy! But that's for you to find out! Anyway, I rate this 7/10.

    Pat Morita, Hilary Swank, Chris Conrad, Constance Towers, and Michael Ironside star in this 1994 drama sequel. In this chapter, Mr. Miyagi (Morita) attends a WWII ceremony in Boston, MA honoring him and his late friend. He visits his friend's widow, Louisa (Towers) and meets her granddaughter, Julie (Swank). He notices that Julie is angry because her parents are dead and takes her anger out on Louisa. He asks Louisa to spend time in his house in California while he helps Julie. He takes Julie her under his wing teaching her karate to defend herself against bullies in school and regain her self-confidence. Julie also meets Eric (Conrad), a boy in school who's a cadet for the air force and they fall for each other. Eric and Julie face the same bullies in league with Col. Dugan (Ironside) who's a war nut. This is a pretty good sequel, Morita and Swank are great together and Bill Conti's score is excellent as usual. I recommend this.

    Now enters the new Karate Kid in a female persona for The Next Karate Kid,also known as The Karate Kid Part IV. After a disastrous Karate Kid Part III,the producers have extended the series to Part IV this time with a new female lead. The Next Karate Kid is the fourth and final film in the original The Karate Kid series. It stars Hilary Swank and Pat Morita. The film was was directed by Christopher Cain and written by Mark Lee.It is the only film in the original series that doesn't feature Ralph Macchio,who played Daniel LaRusso. The story of the film picks up with janitor/martial arts maven Miyagi Yakuga. This time, his pupil is orphaned 17-year-old Julie, the granddaughter of Miyagi's war buddy. Relentlessly bullied by her male classmates and feeling responsible for her parents' fatal accident, Miyagi takes this time to take Julie to a Buddhist monastery in order to teach her the true ways of karate.In here,she learns, through direct lessons, balance, co-ordination, awareness, and respect for all life self-worth.The film ends as we know how when Julie finally takes revenge on the male classmates who used to bully her. The film follows the same formula of the first three sequels using a new prot&eacute;g&eacute;.So there are no surprises in it. It was too long and very predictable.Also,it offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence.The only good thing about this film was the performance of future Academy Award winner,Hilary Swank who made a breakout performance in it.And most of all,it was a little better than the second sequel as this film did not receive any Razzies nomination unlike the latter which got 5. In summary,inspite of the fact that the series tries to infuse a new blood with a new lead,the Karate Kid series has already lost steam and this time,it is evident to put a close into it.
