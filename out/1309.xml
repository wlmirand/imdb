    This is a landmark film in American film history. When it was released in 1973 it was lambasted by both "Right" and "Left"-wing film critics for it presenting of LGBT-relationships as the equivalent to "traditional" marriage. Today, as that debate has taken center-stage in American Society, the films can now be seen as "prophetic." The failure of the film and the critical attacks from all sides of the cultural debate, contributed to the filmmaker to ultimately commit suicide. This is a cautionary posting to Indy filmmakers. You never know. Today, his film is being shown in numerous American universities as part of the canon of significant films. I'd bet this film is shown in more university film classes in 2013 than the Academy Award winning "Around the World in 80 Days." - G. Tom Poe, Ph.D. - Film Studies, The University of Missouri, Kansas City.

    A hidden gem and one of the few good movies about homosexuality I've seen. Thank god and the writer for the following: (a) No AIDS - infinite gay protagonists have been starved and killed in movies using this, don't need to be reminded about this every time. (b) No Melodrama, drag queens, etc - plenty already out there (some passing sentimentality, nothing that one can't overlook) (c) No depressing scenes about being gay or sexually confused or fighting the system for rights - enough is enough. (d) No plastic Hollywood porn - freely available online when you need it badly (the movie has the right dosage of genuine sensuousness :-) What I personally liked was the realistic and honest depiction of a relationship between individuals, particularly the sexy affection that exists in any sexual relationship, you rarely see this in movies, homo or hetero. A cheerful and touching film, you wouldn't need to cry (again) after seeing this one, perhaps people (& directors) understood homosexuality and human relationship/love better in 1974. Don't miss this one, whether gay or not, satisfaction guaranteed.

    The know how demonstrates that liberation is a construct, it is polemical, it is poetic, amateurish and cheesy and shines through with its peculiar accents. I give the film a perfect ten, despite its various flaws, despite its, perhaps, now alien sensibility - as if it is deported from another solar system -, not because it needs a score, or it's in the film's design a purpose to score, but because it simply "sutures" a historical and aesthetic space with its aura and determination from "before the trauma", and I consider this commanding. When the film begun I was nagged by the quality of the copy I saw: as if on a par with a careless Jack Wrangler copy - but as soon as, in the first ten seconds or so, the liturgical scene was cut with a slice of a 'Pride' interviewee, I was bemused; I sensed what was to follow: a very sensible mix of fictional and polemical film-making, with an artistic signature of its own. The film's flaw comes with what we would call character development, though to call it that is to miss or mistake the film's polemical tone. At least for me, born after the film was made, that reads like a certain numbness of evaluating the new, emergent gay identity, that's why we have on the one hand lines that show the individuals talking together are exactly that, and on the other hand a certain lack in spontaneously expressing feelings, or lack thereof, as if being polemical and political (liberation and the psychologizing jargon of the period) was more important, and was an alibi for the usual cardboard smugness. Well, this is something that still exists, stupidly. Instead of letting of some steam, as they say in the film (well, not in the same way), or converting the other humorously to our whim, this behavior is one of the permanent misunderstandings of the human condition, even if the weight seems to be on groups that have suffered oppression for too long and hence have questions of pride to resolve. For I would certainly prefer tensions to be resolved with humor, and why not a certain touch of french seduction, but that would be to ask for another film, and would be a misfire. At least after Stonewall, they certainly settle things differently in the States. But the ambiguity in the end, in David's words "I know there are not many people, but there are people," which sounds directed towards matters of social acceptance, erotic camaraderie and a delineation of the way things are, is charmingly answered by Jason's "Say, I love you" to the lens, once more. With that phrase, David seems to have learned something, more importantly and manly to recognize his failures and gaps and so give space to his desire, not as a ready-made space for the other, which was his mistake with Mark, but something that involves patience - and also that the film finds its balance, through its representatives, between personal pathos and an uncompromising, emerging political awareness. That's why the slow motion version of Paradise Regained in the end (watch how marvelously and plentifully the sea's blue enters and relieves the screen) is all the more painful: we are now witnessing the film from the wrong end of the 80's, at least. Be it twenty, or thirty years, the trauma of AIDS is still here. Even if medication will eradicate it, the sense of innocence the film purveys is something unrepeatable, for its combination of sexual and political liberation. It may be that sexual liberation and political liberation are clumsy and cheesy and darkened by death, and that the true crux of things lies elsewhere (to put it simply, coming from Greece I have heard various stories from elderly homosexuals that during the period of the junta things where flourishing, because of the army, and because repression meant men sought out men for sex, since women were untouchable or unaffordable - but this is another digression), but the film's transport to Liberation-as-Chariot-of-Fire(-Island), makes it a must see for a renegotiation of an informing sense of loss, citizenship, and beauty.

    I no longer live in Florida, having decided to move to California after the death of my long-time companion/partner -- a life altering event. Having never heard about or seen this movie before, I wish Bill could have viewed this film before he left me! We were pre-Stonewall (I am now in my 80's)and, in fact, living just around the corner from The Stonewall in the NYC Village on the night of that famous explosive event -- another life altering event. A Very Natural Thing is an amazing film that everyone (gay or straight) should (must?)see. It tells a simple story in a very simple manner: expressive of a time when gay men and women were watchful and fearful of exposure. I confess tears streamed down my face -- partially because of the beauty of the film and partially grieving for lost youth. I hope younger homosexuals will not disparage the old-fashion-ness or the lack of modern day cinematic sophistication of this outstanding piece of film work: indeed a thing of beauty and a joy forever.

    I remember seeing this when it first came out. It was a revelation back then, today it seems like a good story with bad production values. Just seeing two guys kissing on screen was a very big deal back then, then to see them naked too. Oh my. We were beside ourselves. I don't think anyone noticed just how bad the lighting and sound were, we just wanted to see ourselves reflected on the silver screen. Bad editing was easily forgiven. I just finished watching a special about the history of Fire Island on Logo, then I rented this movie. Must be my 70's day. It's hard to believe I lived through that era and that thirty years have passed. I wonder what has happened to each of the three leads? I don't recall seeing them in anything else.

    This 1973 film tells a story of gay life that is simple and familiar. Boy meets boy. Boy loves boy. Boy gets bored with boy. Etcetera. The straightforward, non-apologetic script is either timeless or old as the hills, depending on your tolerance level. While I was watching I began to wonder if the script could be re-shot today without significant modification. I think it probably could--there isn't much happening that couldn't take place almost word-for-word in any present-day urbanopolis. Despite the sometimes raging amateurism in acting, photography, and especially sound, this film is well worth seeing. Those who lived through the era will experience an affectionate nostalgia for what I cannot help but call "the good old days." For those born after, say, 1985, you'll get an accurate look at what gay life was like as it was beginning to coalesce post-Stonewall. The production of the film also reflects the times. Some scenes have a cinema verite feel, some are clearly documentary. The last scene's unflinching male "frontal" nudity is another relic of the 70s. Like I said, the good old days. I would classify this as a "must-see" for any gay cinema buff. To my knowledge it is the first to grapple with the relationship problems unique to post-Stonewall gay life.

    This is a beautiful period piece. Even though the direction is uneven (but gets better in the last half) it carries a powerful message which still has meaning 3 decades later. It has less sex than the series "Queer as Folk",or cable "Adult Movies", yet still communicates this aspect of gay relationships. The surprising thing when viewed from an historical perspective, is that society's attitudes toward diversity have changed little and gay people are still struggling with the problems presented in this movie. An additional plus, is that it deals with the difficulties facing all human relationships, whether gay or heterosexual. A must see film.

    I stumbled across this film from Netflix. I really had no preconceived notions of the film when I got the DVD in the mail. I was surprised and uplifted to see a film that was extremely progressive for being filmed in 1973(!) The discussions and concepts brought to light are somewhat the same as now. There was an openness to the cast and real people interviewed during the film that I was unaware of during the early 70s. So many times gay films seem to lack real substance and can't get over the basic premise of dealing with being gay and using stereotypical characters. The story moves from beyond that point and deals with real issues, even if it's just finding someone to love. I was very impressed and it was a great story of modern gay relationships.

    Some very fine reviews already posted for this interesting movie, which I found very enjoyable as an intriguing look at gay life and also from a historical point of view. It often has the flavor of a documentary because of the interjection of real newsreel scenes of Stonewall. The cruising episodes on Fire Island and in steam baths have a cinema verite quality. The story involving the up-and-down efforts of ex-priest David to find a man he can settle down with hold the viewer's interested, but the bickering between the two men becomes a drag on the movie. One is relieved when David finally hooks up with the Bo White character, leading to a very beautiful closing episode shot amid the dunes at Truro on Cape Cod. The movie therefore ends on a note of affirmation and one hopes that all went well for all the men involved in this important glimpse at gay life a generation ago.

    I only heard of this film in passing, and did not realize how good it was until I rented the DVD. Don't be put off by the dated 1970s music, wardrobes, hairstyles, small-budget, grainy photography, etc. for this is a milestone in gay cinema. Made just about 5 years after the groundbreaking "Boys in The Band", this greatly improves upon that film, with no self-loathing characters, but natural, real people. The writer-director Christopher Clark incorporates pensive dialogue in the story of an ex-Seminary student who finds love with one man, but is soon turned away from him and eventually finds peace with someone else. The musical score is moving, with classical pieces and more. Cast of unknowns unfortunately remained that way, but they are all outstanding. The parade sequences give added flavor and still timely food for thought. The last 5 minutes, with slow-motion photography and soaring music (pre-dates "Chariots of Fire" -1981), better illustrates male bonding than anything seen before or since. Most of the latter-day gay films remain silly, shallow, frequently mean-spirited fodder, with "Making Love" (1982 - good, "Maurice" (1987 - better) "Big Eden" (2000 -great) among the few notable exceptions. A classic awaiting rediscovery.

The writer-director Christopher Clark incorporates pensive dialogue in the story of an ex-Seminary student who finds love with one man, but is soon turned away from him and eventually finds peace with someone else. The musical score is moving, with classical pieces and more. Cast of unknowns unfortunately remained that way, but they are all outstanding. The parade sequences give added flavor and still timely food for thought. The last 5 minutes, with slow-motion photography and soaring music (pre-dates "Chariots of Fire" -1981), better illustrates male bonding than anything seen before or since. Most of the latter-day gay films remain silly, shallow, frequently mean-spirited fodder, with "Making Love" (1982 - good, "Maurice" (1987 - better) "Big Eden" (2000 -great) among the few notable exceptions. A classic awaiting rediscovery.
