 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Paulina Escobar is the housewife to a prominent lawyer in an unnamed South American country just out of a dictatorship. One day a storm forces her husband to ride home with a neighbor. That chance encounter brings up demons from her past, as she is convinced that the neighbor (Dr. Miranda) was part of the old fascist regime that tortured and raped her, while blindfolded. Paulina takes him captive to determine the truth. Paulina is torn between her psychological repressions and somber memory, Gerardo is torn between his wife and the law, and Dr. Miranda is forced to endure captivity while husband and wife seek out the uncertain truth about the clouded past.

    One of the most outstanding elements about Roman Polanski's films is the tension in atmosphere and between the characters. The director has consistently succeeded in drawing the viewer by creating tension. Moreover, his use of dark themes and the lesser known add further appeal. After all, who isn't curious about the dark? Polanski also makes full use of what he's got, starting from the cast to the most basic of props. 95% of 'Death and the Maiden' was shot consecutively (in accordance with the script) which couldn't have been an easy thing to do if time and money are constraints. The film only has three actors and each one performs superbly. Ben Kingsley's disturbing and chilling portrayal of a sleazy sadistic doctor lingers in mind. Stuart Wilson is brilliant as the ambivalent lawyer torn between his beliefs. This is also a pleasant turn from the villainous characters he's more famous for. Sigourney Weaver is spellbinding as the former prisoner who finally gets the opportunity to seek her own justice. Polanski tactfully brings forth political and psychological issues without preaching to the audience. some minor flawed issues were the lighting. I felt it was too strong in places (where the only source of light was candles). It looks like there was some poor green screen filtering in a few of the outdoor scenes even though I don't think a green screen was used. However, these faults are too minor when viewing the film as a whole. 'Death and the Maiden'is a simple but engaging and haunting story told through the perspective of three complex characters. It's one of Polanski's finest.

    When Ariel Dorfman's play Death and the Maiden, about a victim of rape and torture in a post-fascist regime coming face-to-face with one of her tormentors, was adapted for the screen, it is perhaps no surprise that the project was snapped up by director Roman Polanski. This is story which is both startlingly sensitive and understanding towards victims of rape, and yet one which also reserves a crumb of sympathy for the perpetrator. Two decades after his own conviction for sex crimes, Polanski's decision to make this movie poses the question. Is this the director's apology, or his attempt at self-absolution? Death and the Maiden is, in the first place, a powerful and thoughtful work, on the one hand an exploration of the nature of justice, of justice that satisfies the law and justice that satisfies the individual. And on the other, it is a look at the differences between male and female approaches to love, sex and control. It is in this latter it is at its boldest and most eloquent, even if it does equivocate. There are numerous points in the dialogue which are deeply poignant simply due to the aching truth of them. The power Dorfman's words are carried through to the screen intact. This is in no small part thanks to a flawless cast. Sigourney Weaver gives an understated yet resonant performance that gives every impression that she has really lived what her character has gone through. In her flashes of anger she brings a touch of masculinity to the part, and there is perhaps something of her trying to take on the doctor's identity in the role. Ben Kingsley is of that new breed of chameleonic actors who are able to transform themselves completely for a range of roles. Here he presents numerous facets of his character  friendliness, erudition, vulnerability, spite, and an eventual coldness, all with realistic fluidity. Stuart Wilson gives a worthy if rather bland performance, which is exactly what's needed, as being the least important of the cast he must not overshadow the other two. While Polanski's own offences should not be considered lightly, I have always tried to judge his work (which I often enjoy) separately to his deeds. He does a fair job here, using some intense long takes for key scenes, and creating various different spaces to help us forget how limited the setting is. The pacing is marvellous, and despite being a talky stage adaptation the movie simply races along. And yet, in the context of Polanski's involvement, its final scenes have a slightly sickening, almost pathetic edge. Finally however, my interpretation of the ending is not that Paulina chose to forgive the doctor, but that what she needed for closure was to hear his explanation.

    Story: Emotionally disturbed wife of a human rights activist and minister of justice to be wakes up in night and hears her husband speaking to an unknown man. In his voice she recognizes a doctor who tortured and raped during the reign of military junta. She attacks him in night, ties him up and under a gunpoint she decides to proceed with a trial. Her husband must reluctantly go what she wants. And so trial which will affect all three protagonists for ever begins. Acting: Breathtaking, acting in this film is incredibly intense. All three actors are great and are believable in their roles. Direction and camera: Again as with acting the films is very intense in the feeling, it is slow but creepy and keeps viewer in doubts right to the end. Music: There is not much music in this film, I remember only the "Death and the maiden" which is of course beautiful. Conclusion: Great film with great acting and atmosphere.

    A political activist (Sigourney Weaver) is convinced that her guest (Ben Kingsley) is a man who once tortured her for the government. Sigourney Weaver topless, not something I ever needed to see. She plays a nut case and I hate her even more than usual in this film. The worst torture I can imagine is having Weaver's used panties stuffed in my mouth. Also, her acting is really, really, really bad. Her casting took this film from a potential success to a steaming pile of horse apples. This was directed by Roman Polanski, whose experience with the Holocaust makes the topic of human rights a personal matter. In the background is a human rights commission to examine torture and murder between 1975-1980 with Weaver's husband as the head and her as a skeptic, thinking the whole thing is a "whitewash". She works, inadvertently, to sabotage it. "You can never entirely possess the female soul." This quote appears, attributed to Nietzsche. What is its significance?

    The movie script of "Death and the Maiden" is originated from a screenplay with the same name by Ariel Dorfman from Chile. This script has a great structure. The wife is listening to the radio while cooking the dinner. The news on the radio tells about foundation of a committee for investigation about tortures and crimes of the previous dictatorship naming someone as the head of this committee. The unusual attention of the wife leads the movie viewers to suppose a relation between the wife and those phenomena. The electricity went off. The fear of the wife might be because of hearing the thunderstorm or remembering past horrors. The wife ran quickly to a battery radio to continue listening to the news. Here, the viewer became sure about the importance of the news. The nervous attitude of the wife, going under the rain, smoking a cigarette and taking a gun by seeing a coming vehicle, either show this. Then, something else happens. The husband introduces himself to the vehicle driver - the doctor- and the viewers figure out that he is the head of the committee. This causes the viewers to forget their previous conclusions and think that the main reason of the wife's reactions is hearing her husband's name. While thinking about this, the dialogs between the couple return the viewers back to the first conclusion. The movie keeps the viewers in a reciprocating situation, which continues along the story. The husband thinks he knows everything about his wife's prison but figures out it was not. The wife gains new information about a sexual relation between his husband and another girl during her prison time and the viewers us not sure about the guilt of the doctor. This uncertainty is smartly placed in the script. In the other side, the battery radio used to show the importance of the news in the beginning of the film, was utilized again in the middle to prove the crime of the doctor without any encounter to went off electricity and plays the "Death and the Maiden" piece to show the title of the film.

    (Though this doesn't contain all surprises or, ah hem, spoilers, it does borderline it. #1 just watch the movie  it is a near-masterpiece, a near perfect suspense thriller/mystery everyone (of age) should see. #2 then read my review. It's very hard to write about it without giving away too much.) It was more of a crime that Weaver was neither nominated nor won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1994 than the crimes committed against her in the movie, Death and the Maiden. Okay, that's taking it a bit far; what happened to her character was unmistakably HORRIBLE, but she still should've won something for her fantastic post-victim performance. And it was a further crime hardly anyone saw this near-masterpiece of a small/indie film that screams stage play. In fact, when I first saw this many years ago, aside from being immediately enthralled in the story and acting of Weaver, my first reaction was this was meant for the stage  and this was before I did find out, in fact, it was previously a theatre production. What we have here, in one of my all-time favorite movies, is paranoid Paulina (Weaver) living in isolation with her lawyer-husband, Gerardo (Wilson) in a South American now-"supposedly" free country. Gerardo had a flat, was late for dinner and Paulina's p|ssed..but it's not clear up front on why. Slowly, but absolutely surelythe pieces fall into place, ever so deliberately on why she's both paranoid and p|ssed. But as bad of a life she makes you believe she hasthe past is about to make things a little worst. Gerardo had a Good Samaritan for his flat tire in the form of Dr. Miranda (Kingsley) and upon the doctor's admiration for the lawyer who's about to work for the President on anti-torture criminals  and a few drinks  Paulina's senses go into overdrive. She is absolutely sure the voice and even smell from the other room where she's "pretending to be sleeping" that the good ole doc was her captive from awhile back. I really don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say, she was kidnapped prior to the movie started and Pauline believes this stranger was (one of) her torturer(s). Eventually, she's going to make him prove he did it, or his innocence. One way or another. Literally, I am going to stop here. I've given away only 5% of the movie, and I feel that's too much. This movie, with literally only three actors, plays out in deep mystery and suspense and you will feel every bit of the pain Weaver wants you to. She is an astonishing actress and proves it here. You would need to be in a 3-person movie. The other two, Kingsley and Wilson, were also good, but this is Weaver's show. Her and her character's redemption or potential healing. It won't take too much of your time  it's relatively short, but it will be worth seeing this wonderful movie and you will see past Ripley (Alien). (Actually, a little too much, at times. Boy, Weaver wanted to get naked for this movie)

    Films like this generally are problematic. They are written as plays and kept as plays when carried over, so the filmmaker is limited to a preset notion of the space. "Rope" was taken as a challenge in this regard, with a master visionary exploiting the confinement. It was, in effect, a learning experience for him without much reward for us, beyond what the play itself carried. Here in this film, we have something similar I believe. Polanski is a rare talent, a filmmaker that understands confinement  indeed his whole life is defined by the concept. He was approached to direct-for-hire and took the job, I believe, because he wanted a similar learning experience. So what we have here is a screenplay that was frozen before the man started his film and which he has taken unaltered. Someone else selected the actors, making what I think were bad choices. On this, Polanski designed the eye, making what I see as a whole different movie on top of the play. The play is about a woman who had been victimized by state torture. She believes she has encountered her torturer; the film is about the encounter and the extent to which you can trust her narrative or the accused. Her husband presides; he is literally a lawyer selected by the new president to sort out just these sorts of conflicting truths. The question is: will the accused confess? Well he does before the film is over, but was his confession true? Neither one of these two gives us much reason to trust them as characters. They both are liars. What Polanski does is subtly more the stance of the camera so that we alternate between who is the narrator so far as the lines compared to who is the aligned watcher and whose narrative space is tentatively trusted. It is a remarkable exercise, of just the kind that he would devour. I believe he used these skills in a similar weave of untrusted narrative in his next film, "Gate," which I think is an unappreciated masterpiece. But unless you happen to be tuned into this movie on a movie, this narrative about narrative, you will find this a pretty tame encounter. Unless you happen to live in a country that sponsors torture. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    A woman seeks revenge from a man she recognizes as a government official who tortured and raped her years ago for her political views. Based on a play, the setting could have been post-WWII Germany with a Jewish woman going against her Nazi persecutor. However, it is set in an unnamed South American country. There are only three characters and most of the action takes place on a single set, but Polanski manages to sustain the tension throughout. Weaver is convincing as the vengeful woman. Wilson and Kingsley are fine as her husband and the man she accuses of war crimes, respectively. The title comes from Schubert's 14th string quartet, which was played every time Weaver was raped.

    We hear about it all the time; people have been harmed in the most unspeakable ways, causing pain that most of us cannot begin to even imagine. If this happened to you, what would you do if the person who hurt you walked into your house? This kind of moral quagmire has been approached before in films. Many times, in fact. The torture angle is new though. Unfortunately, that's all that's new about this story. But this is the situation that one woman, Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), an ex-activist who was horrifically tortured in order to give up the name of a fellow activist (who later became her husband), finds herself in, when a man (Ben Kingsley) is invited into their home after helping her husband (Stuart Wilson). She is convinced that this man, Dr. Miranda, is the one who brutalized her. He denies it, of course. And her husband, now a high-powered lawyer, is caught in the middle. This film could have gone in two opposite directions: a high-powered, claustrophobic thriller or a leadened message movie. Fortunately, it's not the latter (no one is going to mistake this movie for a UNICEF infomercial), but sadly, it's not the former either. It's somewhere in the middle. There are moments of where it works, but overall it's pretty boring. Part of the reason is that the most important part is miscast. Sigourney Weaver is a good actress, but she's not right for this role. She has moments of effectiveness (Weaver is good at being vulnerable), but when she tries to act menacing, she's awful. Ben Kingsley is terrific, though, as the may-or-may not be torturer. He keeps us on our toes, and we never know whether or not he's innocent. Noted character actor Stuart Wilson is actually able to keep up with the Oscar-winner and Oscar-nominee. The problem isn't necessarily with Roman Polanski's approach. "Death and the Maiden" is heavy on the atmosphere, although it could have used some more claustrophobia to increase the tension. The problem is that the script, based on the play, is rather bland. There's nothing that really draws us into the story, and it doesn't take any risks. Thus what could have been a powerful and provocative drama or thriller (take your pick) becomes inert. It's not a total waste; the film effectively keeps us guessing who's telling the truth. But the suspense isn't there, even though it has plenty of opportunity to build. However, the ending of the film is horrible. What happens not only doesn't make sense, it's actually more than slightly reprehensible. This isn't a bad film, just a wasted opportunity.

    This is one of the cinematic homes for this filmmaker. He swims comfortably in these waters. Polanski requires very little elements to induce great tension in any film. That's why he has looked for scripts like this, often in his career. This is a great thing, the ability to take very few scenery elements, in this case a single very small house, and the surrounding landscape, and build the narrative over that. Because that's what we have. The story is simple enough to produce no distractions, and the landscape is wide and desert enough to do the same. What we have is a whole set up that surrounds an idea of uncertain truth, provisional reality (to our eyes). That's why we never stop wondering whether Weaver is right or wrong, whether Kingsley is a rapist or a victim. So does Stuart Wilson, who goes through the same range of doubt as we, spectators, go, and that makes him our surrogate in the film. We are judges to our own sentence. All the cruelty of an invented regime of a supposed south American country is the mere formalization of the credibility of the world. It is not about denouncing crimes nor about discussing politics, as it has been said. Also, much has been said about how much the final monologue reveals the truth, i say it keeps all the possibilities opened, though it suggests sincerity. As an idea, this is as simple as it gets, and as every simple idea, it's so hard to achieve, keeping it simple. That's where things get interesting, when you check the cinematic devices that surround and collaborate with the simplicity of a simple doubt that this theatrical script suggests. First we have the core of the story framed, at beginning and end, by the core music, a quartet which names the film, and gives consistency to the drama of Sigourney's character. We have the handling of the wide open landscape, with its lighthouse. The sense of green isolation, the poetics of the location, which growths on us, as it is given in small bits, until becoming the final stage to the real drama. The house. This part matters, as this a film by a director who really knows how to handle space and include it in the drama. This is worth for a hotel room, a boat, or a small house. This is what he has been making throughout his life, in "knife in the water", his apartment trilogy, bitter moon and this one. It is something i admire, the ability to include the space that surrounds the characters into their dramas and discussions. That's one way, one of deepest ways to include (architectural) space in the fields of cinema. Orson Welles, Hitchcock (sometimes), Polanski... they all trust on their own camera. We have the acting at the center of the success of this film. Everyone of the 3 actors involved play at their top here, each one knows where he stands, and interprets perfectly what is required of him to make things flow. Ambiguity, to Ben Kinsgley, Messed up mind to Sigourney Weaver, Reactiveness and indecision to Stuart Wilson. This is less achieved than other efforts, but Roman never ceases to deliver his special gaze, and that's always worth seeing. My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

The fear of the wife might be because of hearing the thunderstorm or remembering past horrors. The wife ran quickly to a battery radio to continue listening to the news. Here, the viewer became sure about the importance of the news. The nervous attitude of the wife, going under the rain, smoking a cigarette and taking a gun by seeing a coming vehicle, either show this. Then, something else happens. The husband introduces himself to the vehicle driver - the doctor- and the viewers figure out that he is the head of the committee. This causes the viewers to forget their previous conclusions and think that the main reason of the wife's reactions is hearing her husband's name. While thinking about this, the dialogs between the couple return the viewers back to the first conclusion. The movie keeps the viewers in a reciprocating situation, which continues along the story. The husband thinks he knows everything about his wife's prison but figures out it was not. The wife gains new information about a sexual relation between his husband and another girl during her prison time and the viewers us not sure about the guilt of the doctor. This uncertainty is smartly placed in the script. In the other side, the battery radio used to show the importance of the news in the beginning of the film, was utilized again in the middle to prove the crime of the doctor without any encounter to went off electricity and plays the "Death and the Maiden" piece to show the title of the film.

    (Though this doesn't contain all surprises or, ah hem, spoilers, it does borderline it. #1 just watch the movie  it is a near-masterpiece, a near perfect suspense thriller/mystery everyone (of age) should see. #2 then read my review. It's very hard to write about it without giving away too much.) It was more of a crime that Weaver was neither nominated nor won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1994 than the crimes committed against her in the movie, Death and the Maiden. Okay, that's taking it a bit far; what happened to her character was unmistakably HORRIBLE, but she still should've won something for her fantastic post-victim performance. And it was a further crime hardly anyone saw this near-masterpiece of a small/indie film that screams stage play. In fact, when I first saw this many years ago, aside from being immediately enthralled in the story and acting of Weaver, my first reaction was this was meant for the stage  and this was before I did find out, in fact, it was previously a theatre production. What we have here, in one of my all-time favorite movies, is paranoid Paulina (Weaver) living in isolation with her lawyer-husband, Gerardo (Wilson) in a South American now-"supposedly" free country. Gerardo had a flat, was late for dinner and Paulina's p|ssed..but it's not clear up front on why. Slowly, but absolutely surelythe pieces fall into place, ever so deliberately on why she's both paranoid and p|ssed. But as bad of a life she makes you believe she hasthe past is about to make things a little worst. Gerardo had a Good Samaritan for his flat tire in the form of Dr. Miranda (Kingsley) and upon the doctor's admiration for the lawyer who's about to work for the President on anti-torture criminals  and a few drinks  Paulina's senses go into overdrive. She is absolutely sure the voice and even smell from the other room where she's "pretending to be sleeping" that the good ole doc was her captive from awhile back. I really don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say, she was kidnapped prior to the movie started and Pauline believes this stranger was (one of) her torturer(s). Eventually, she's going to make him prove he did it, or his innocence. One way or another. Literally, I am going to stop here. I've given away only 5% of the movie, and I feel that's too much. This movie, with literally only three actors, plays out in deep mystery and suspense and you will feel every bit of the pain Weaver wants you to. She is an astonishing actress and proves it here. You would need to be in a 3-person movie. The other two, Kingsley and Wilson, were also good, but this is Weaver's show. Her and her character's redemption or potential healing. It won't take too much of your time  it's relatively short, but it will be worth seeing this wonderful movie and you will see past Ripley (Alien). (Actually, a little too much, at times. Boy, Weaver wanted to get naked for this movie)

    Films like this generally are problematic. They are written as plays and kept as plays when carried over, so the filmmaker is limited to a preset notion of the space. "Rope" was taken as a challenge in this regard, with a master visionary exploiting the confinement. It was, in effect, a learning experience for him without much reward for us, beyond what the play itself carried. Here in this film, we have something similar I believe. Polanski is a rare talent, a filmmaker that understands confinement  indeed his whole life is defined by the concept. He was approached to direct-for-hire and took the job, I believe, because he wanted a similar learning experience. So what we have here is a screenplay that was frozen before the man started his film and which he has taken unaltered. Someone else selected the actors, making what I think were bad choices. On this, Polanski designed the eye, making what I see as a whole different movie on top of the play. The play is about a woman who had been victimized by state torture. She believes she has encountered her torturer; the film is about the encounter and the extent to which you can trust her narrative or the accused. Her husband presides; he is literally a lawyer selected by the new president to sort out just these sorts of conflicting truths. The question is: will the accused confess? Well he does before the film is over, but was his confession true? Neither one of these two gives us much reason to trust them as characters. They both are liars. What Polanski does is subtly more the stance of the camera so that we alternate between who is the narrator so far as the lines compared to who is the aligned watcher and whose narrative space is tentatively trusted. It is a remarkable exercise, of just the kind that he would devour. I believe he used these skills in a similar weave of untrusted narrative in his next film, "Gate," which I think is an unappreciated masterpiece. But unless you happen to be tuned into this movie on a movie, this narrative about narrative, you will find this a pretty tame encounter. Unless you happen to live in a country that sponsors torture.

    A woman seeks revenge from a man she recognizes as a government official who tortured and raped her years ago for her political views. Based on a play, the setting could have been post-WWII Germany with a Jewish woman going against her Nazi persecutor. However, it is set in an unnamed South American country. There are only three characters and most of the action takes place on a single set, but Polanski manages to sustain the tension throughout. Weaver is convincing as the vengeful woman. Wilson and Kingsley are fine as her husband and the man she accuses of war crimes, respectively. The title comes from Schubert's 14th string quartet, which was played every time Weaver was raped.

    We hear about it all the time; people have been harmed in the most unspeakable ways, causing pain that most of us cannot begin to even imagine. If this happened to you, what would you do if the person who hurt you walked into your house? This kind of moral quagmire has been approached before in films. Many times, in fact. The torture angle is new though. Unfortunately, that's all that's new about this story. But this is the situation that one woman, Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), an ex-activist who was horrifically tortured in order to give up the name of a fellow activist (who later became her husband), finds herself in, when a man (Ben Kingsley) is invited into their home after helping her husband (Stuart Wilson). She is convinced that this man, Dr. Miranda, is the one who brutalized her. He denies it, of course. And her husband, now a high-powered lawyer, is caught in the middle. This film could have gone in two opposite directions: a high-powered, claustrophobic thriller or a leadened message movie. Fortunately, it's not the latter (no one is going to mistake this movie for a UNICEF infomercial), but sadly, it's not the former either. It's somewhere in the middle. There are moments of where it works, but overall it's pretty boring. Part of the reason is that the most important part is miscast. Sigourney Weaver is a good actress, but she's not right for this role. She has moments of effectiveness (Weaver is good at being vulnerable), but when she tries to act menacing, she's awful. Ben Kingsley is terrific, though, as the may-or-may not be torturer. He keeps us on our toes, and we never know whether or not he's innocent. Noted character actor Stuart Wilson is actually able to keep up with the Oscar-winner and Oscar-nominee. The problem isn't necessarily with Roman Polanski's approach. "Death and the Maiden" is heavy on the atmosphere, although it could have used some more claustrophobia to increase the tension. The problem is that the script, based on the play, is rather bland. There's nothing that really draws us into the story, and it doesn't take any risks. Thus what could have been a powerful and provocative drama or thriller (take your pick) becomes inert. It's not a total waste; the film effectively keeps us guessing who's telling the truth. But the suspense isn't there, even though it has plenty of opportunity to build. However, the ending of the film is horrible. What happens not only doesn't make sense, it's actually more than slightly reprehensible. This isn't a bad film, just a wasted opportunity.

    This is one of the cinematic homes for this filmmaker. He swims comfortably in these waters. Polanski requires very little elements to induce great tension in any film. That's why he has looked for scripts like this, often in his career. This is a great thing, the ability to take very few scenery elements, in this case a single very small house, and the surrounding landscape, and build the narrative over that. Because that's what we have. The story is simple enough to produce no distractions, and the landscape is wide and desert enough to do the same. What we have is a whole set up that surrounds an idea of uncertain truth, provisional reality (to our eyes). That's why we never stop wondering whether Weaver is right or wrong, whether Kingsley is a rapist or a victim. So does Stuart Wilson, who goes through the same range of doubt as we, spectators, go, and that makes him our surrogate in the film. We are judges to our own sentence. All the cruelty of an invented regime of a supposed south American country is the mere formalization of the credibility of the world. It is not about denouncing crimes nor about discussing politics, as it has been said. Also, much has been said about how much the final monologue reveals the truth, i say it keeps all the possibilities opened, though it suggests sincerity. As an idea, this is as simple as it gets, and as every simple idea, it's so hard to achieve, keeping it simple. That's where things get interesting, when you check the cinematic devices that surround and collaborate with the simplicity of a simple doubt that this theatrical script suggests. First we have the core of the story framed, at beginning and end, by the core music, a quartet which names the film, and gives consistency to the drama of Sigourney's character. We have the handling of the wide open landscape, with its lighthouse. The sense of green isolation, the poetics of the location, which growths on us, as it is given in small bits, until becoming the final stage to the real drama. The house. This part matters, as this a film by a director who really knows how to handle space and include it in the drama. This is worth for a hotel room, a boat, or a small house. This is what he has been making throughout his life, in "knife in the water", his apartment trilogy, bitter moon and this one. It is something i admire, the ability to include the space that surrounds the characters into their dramas and discussions. That's one way, one of deepest ways to include (architectural) space in the fields of cinema. Orson Welles, Hitchcock (sometimes), Polanski... they all trust on their own camera. We have the acting at the center of the success of this film. Everyone of the 3 actors involved play at their top here, each one knows where he stands, and interprets perfectly what is required of him to make things flow. Ambiguity, to Ben Kinsgley, Messed up mind to Sigourney Weaver, Reactiveness and indecision to Stuart Wilson. This is less achieved than other efforts, but Roman never ceases to deliver his special gaze, and that's always worth seeing. My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    One of the most outstanding elements about Roman Polanski's films is the tension in atmosphere and between the characters. The director has consistently succeeded in drawing the viewer by creating tension. Moreover, his use of dark themes and the lesser known add further appeal. After all, who isn't curious about the dark? Polanski also makes full use of what he's got, starting from the cast to the most basic of props. 95% of 'Death and the Maiden' was shot consecutively (in accordance with the script) which couldn't have been an easy thing to do if time and money are constraints. The film only has three actors and each one performs superbly. Ben Kingsley's disturbing and chilling portrayal of a sleazy sadistic doctor lingers in mind. Stuart Wilson is brilliant as the ambivalent lawyer torn between his beliefs. This is also a pleasant turn from the villainous characters he's more famous for. Sigourney Weaver is spellbinding as the former prisoner who finally gets the opportunity to seek her own justice. Polanski tactfully brings forth political and psychological issues without preaching to the audience. some minor flawed issues were the lighting. I felt it was too strong in places (where the only source of light was candles). It looks like there was some poor green screen filtering in a few of the outdoor scenes even though I don't think a green screen was used. However, these faults are too minor when viewing the film as a whole. 'Death and the Maiden'is a simple but engaging and haunting story told through the perspective of three complex characters. It's one of Polanski's finest.

    When Ariel Dorfman's play Death and the Maiden, about a victim of rape and torture in a post-fascist regime coming face-to-face with one of her tormentors, was adapted for the screen, it is perhaps no surprise that the project was snapped up by director Roman Polanski. This is story which is both startlingly sensitive and understanding towards victims of rape, and yet one which also reserves a crumb of sympathy for the perpetrator. Two decades after his own conviction for sex crimes, Polanski's decision to make this movie poses the question. Is this the director's apology, or his attempt at self-absolution? Death and the Maiden is, in the first place, a powerful and thoughtful work, on the one hand an exploration of the nature of justice, of justice that satisfies the law and justice that satisfies the individual. And on the other, it is a look at the differences between male and female approaches to love, sex and control. It is in this latter it is at its boldest and most eloquent, even if it does equivocate. There are numerous points in the dialogue which are deeply poignant simply due to the aching truth of them. The power Dorfman's words are carried through to the screen intact. This is in no small part thanks to a flawless cast. Sigourney Weaver gives an understated yet resonant performance that gives every impression that she has really lived what her character has gone through. In her flashes of anger she brings a touch of masculinity to the part, and there is perhaps something of her trying to take on the doctor's identity in the role. Ben Kingsley is of that new breed of chameleonic actors who are able to transform themselves completely for a range of roles. Here he presents numerous facets of his character  friendliness, erudition, vulnerability, spite, and an eventual coldness, all with realistic fluidity. Stuart Wilson gives a worthy if rather bland performance, which is exactly what's needed, as being the least important of the cast he must not overshadow the other two. While Polanski's own offences should not be considered lightly, I have always tried to judge his work (which I often enjoy) separately to his deeds. He does a fair job here, using some intense long takes for key scenes, and creating various different spaces to help us forget how limited the setting is. The pacing is marvellous, and despite being a talky stage adaptation the movie simply races along. And yet, in the context of Polanski's involvement, its final scenes have a slightly sickening, almost pathetic edge. Finally however, my interpretation of the ending is not that Paulina chose to forgive the doctor, but that what she needed for closure was to hear his explanation.

    Story: Emotionally disturbed wife of a human rights activist and minister of justice to be wakes up in night and hears her husband speaking to an unknown man. In his voice she recognizes a doctor who tortured and raped during the reign of military junta. She attacks him in night, ties him up and under a gunpoint she decides to proceed with a trial. Her husband must reluctantly go what she wants. And so trial which will affect all three protagonists for ever begins. Acting: Breathtaking, acting in this film is incredibly intense. All three actors are great and are believable in their roles. Direction and camera: Again as with acting the films is very intense in the feeling, it is slow but creepy and keeps viewer in doubts right to the end. Music: There is not much music in this film, I remember only the "Death and the maiden" which is of course beautiful. Conclusion: Great film with great acting and atmosphere.

    A political activist (Sigourney Weaver) is convinced that her guest (Ben Kingsley) is a man who once tortured her for the government. Sigourney Weaver topless, not something I ever needed to see. She plays a nut case and I hate her even more than usual in this film. The worst torture I can imagine is having Weaver's used panties stuffed in my mouth. Also, her acting is really, really, really bad. Her casting took this film from a potential success to a steaming pile of horse apples. This was directed by Roman Polanski, whose experience with the Holocaust makes the topic of human rights a personal matter. In the background is a human rights commission to examine torture and murder between 1975-1980 with Weaver's husband as the head and her as a skeptic, thinking the whole thing is a "whitewash". She works, inadvertently, to sabotage it. "You can never entirely possess the female soul." This quote appears, attributed to Nietzsche. What is its significance?

    The movie script of "Death and the Maiden" is originated from a screenplay with the same name by Ariel Dorfman from Chile. This script has a great structure. The wife is listening to the radio while cooking the dinner. The news on the radio tells about foundation of a committee for investigation about tortures and crimes of the previous dictatorship naming someone as the head of this committee. The unusual attention of the wife leads the movie viewers to suppose a relation between the wife and those phenomena. The electricity went off. The fear of the wife might be because of hearing the thunderstorm or remembering past horrors. The wife ran quickly to a battery radio to continue listening to the news. Here, the viewer became sure about the importance of the news. The nervous attitude of the wife, going under the rain, smoking a cigarette and taking a gun by seeing a coming vehicle, either show this. Then, something else happens. The husband introduces himself to the vehicle driver - the doctor- and the viewers figure out that he is the head of the committee. This causes the viewers to forget their previous conclusions and think that the main reason of the wife's reactions is hearing her husband's name.

    We hear about it all the time; people have been harmed in the most unspeakable ways, causing pain that most of us cannot begin to even imagine. If this happened to you, what would you do if the person who hurt you walked into your house? This kind of moral quagmire has been approached before in films. Many times, in fact. The torture angle is new though. Unfortunately, that's all that's new about this story. But this is the situation that one woman, Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), an ex-activist who was horrifically tortured in order to give up the name of a fellow activist (who later became her husband), finds herself in, when a man (Ben Kingsley) is invited into their home after helping her husband (Stuart Wilson). She is convinced that this man, Dr. Miranda, is the one who brutalized her. He denies it, of course. And her husband, now a high-powered lawyer, is caught in the middle. This film could have gone in two opposite directions: a high-powered, claustrophobic thriller or a leadened message movie.

"Death and the Maiden" is heavy on the atmosphere, although it could have used some more claustrophobia to increase the tension. The problem is that the script, based on the play, is rather bland. There's nothing that really draws us into the story, and it doesn't take any risks. Thus what could have been a powerful and provocative drama or thriller (take your pick) becomes inert. It's not a total waste; the film effectively keeps us guessing who's telling the truth. But the suspense isn't there, even though it has plenty of opportunity to build. However, the ending of the film is horrible. What happens not only doesn't make sense, it's actually more than slightly reprehensible. This isn't a bad film, just a wasted opportunity.

    This is one of the cinematic homes for this filmmaker. He swims comfortably in these waters. Polanski requires very little elements to induce great tension in any film. That's why he has looked for scripts like this, often in his career. This is a great thing, the ability to take very few scenery elements, in this case a single very small house, and the surrounding landscape, and build the narrative over that. Because that's what we have. The story is simple enough to produce no distractions, and the landscape is wide and desert enough to do the same. What we have is a whole set up that surrounds an idea of uncertain truth, provisional reality (to our eyes). That's why we never stop wondering whether Weaver is right or wrong, whether Kingsley is a rapist or a victim. So does Stuart Wilson, who goes through the same range of doubt as we, spectators, go, and that makes him our surrogate in the film. We are judges to our own sentence. All the cruelty of an invented regime of a supposed south American country is the mere formalization of the credibility of the world. It is not about denouncing crimes nor about discussing politics, as it has been said. Also, much has been said about how much the final monologue reveals the truth, i say it keeps all the possibilities opened, though it suggests sincerity. As an idea, this is as simple as it gets, and as every simple idea, it's so hard to achieve, keeping it simple. That's where things get interesting, when you check the cinematic devices that surround and collaborate with the simplicity of a simple doubt that this theatrical script suggests. First we have the core of the story framed, at beginning and end, by the core music, a quartet which names the film, and gives consistency to the drama of Sigourney's character. We have the handling of the wide open landscape, with its lighthouse. The sense of green isolation, the poetics of the location, which growths on us, as it is given in small bits, until becoming the final stage to the real drama. The house. This part matters, as this a film by a director who really knows how to handle space and include it in the drama. This is worth for a hotel room, a boat, or a small house. This is what he has been making throughout his life, in "knife in the water", his apartment trilogy, bitter moon and this one. It is something i admire, the ability to include the space that surrounds the characters into their dramas and discussions. That's one way, one of deepest ways to include (architectural) space in the fields of cinema. Orson Welles, Hitchcock (sometimes), Polanski... they all trust on their own camera. We have the acting at the center of the success of this film. Everyone of the 3 actors involved play at their top here, each one knows where he stands, and interprets perfectly what is required of him to make things flow. Ambiguity, to Ben Kinsgley, Messed up mind to Sigourney Weaver, Reactiveness and indecision to Stuart Wilson. This is less achieved than other efforts, but Roman never ceases to deliver his special gaze, and that's always worth seeing. My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    One of the most outstanding elements about Roman Polanski's films is the tension in atmosphere and between the characters. The director has consistently succeeded in drawing the viewer by creating tension. Moreover, his use of dark themes and the lesser known add further appeal. After all, who isn't curious about the dark? Polanski also makes full use of what he's got, starting from the cast to the most basic of props. 95% of 'Death and the Maiden' was shot consecutively (in accordance with the script) which couldn't have been an easy thing to do if time and money are constraints. The film only has three actors and each one performs superbly. Ben Kingsley's disturbing and chilling portrayal of a sleazy sadistic doctor lingers in mind. Stuart Wilson is brilliant as the ambivalent lawyer torn between his beliefs. This is also a pleasant turn from the villainous characters he's more famous for. Sigourney Weaver is spellbinding as the former prisoner who finally gets the opportunity to seek her own justice. Polanski tactfully brings forth political and psychological issues without preaching to the audience. some minor flawed issues were the lighting. I felt it was too strong in places (where the only source of light was candles). It looks like there was some poor green screen filtering in a few of the outdoor scenes even though I don't think a green screen was used. However, these faults are too minor when viewing the film as a whole. 'Death and the Maiden'is a simple but engaging and haunting story told through the perspective of three complex characters. It's one of Polanski's finest.

    When Ariel Dorfman's play Death and the Maiden, about a victim of rape and torture in a post-fascist regime coming face-to-face with one of her tormentors, was adapted for the screen, it is perhaps no surprise that the project was snapped up by director Roman Polanski. This is story which is both startlingly sensitive and understanding towards victims of rape, and yet one which also reserves a crumb of sympathy for the perpetrator. Two decades after his own conviction for sex crimes, Polanski's decision to make this movie poses the question. Is this the director's apology, or his attempt at self-absolution? Death and the Maiden is, in the first place, a powerful and thoughtful work, on the one hand an exploration of the nature of justice, of justice that satisfies the law and justice that satisfies the individual. And on the other, it is a look at the differences between male and female approaches to love, sex and control. It is in this latter it is at its boldest and most eloquent, even if it does equivocate. There are numerous points in the dialogue which are deeply poignant simply due to the aching truth of them. The power Dorfman's words are carried through to the screen intact. This is in no small part thanks to a flawless cast. Sigourney Weaver gives an understated yet resonant performance that gives every impression that she has really lived what her character has gone through. In her flashes of anger she brings a touch of masculinity to the part, and there is perhaps something of her trying to take on the doctor's identity in the role. Ben Kingsley is of that new breed of chameleonic actors who are able to transform themselves completely for a range of roles. Here he presents numerous facets of his character  friendliness, erudition, vulnerability, spite, and an eventual coldness, all with realistic fluidity. Stuart Wilson gives a worthy if rather bland performance, which is exactly what's needed, as being the least important of the cast he must not overshadow the other two. While Polanski's own offences should not be considered lightly, I have always tried to judge his work (which I often enjoy) separately to his deeds. He does a fair job here, using some intense long takes for key scenes, and creating various different spaces to help us forget how limited the setting is. The pacing is marvellous, and despite being a talky stage adaptation the movie simply races along. And yet, in the context of Polanski's involvement, its final scenes have a slightly sickening, almost pathetic edge. Finally however, my interpretation of the ending is not that Paulina chose to forgive the doctor, but that what she needed for closure was to hear his explanation.

    Story: Emotionally disturbed wife of a human rights activist and minister of justice to be wakes up in night and hears her husband speaking to an unknown man. In his voice she recognizes a doctor who tortured and raped during the reign of military junta. She attacks him in night, ties him up and under a gunpoint she decides to proceed with a trial. Her husband must reluctantly go what she wants. And so trial which will affect all three protagonists for ever begins. Acting: Breathtaking, acting in this film is incredibly intense. All three actors are great and are believable in their roles. Direction and camera: Again as with acting the films is very intense in the feeling, it is slow but creepy and keeps viewer in doubts right to the end. Music: There is not much music in this film, I remember only the "Death and the maiden" which is of course beautiful. Conclusion: Great film with great acting and atmosphere.

    A political activist (Sigourney Weaver) is convinced that her guest (Ben Kingsley) is a man who once tortured her for the government. Sigourney Weaver topless, not something I ever needed to see. She plays a nut case and I hate her even more than usual in this film. The worst torture I can imagine is having Weaver's used panties stuffed in my mouth. Also, her acting is really, really, really bad. Her casting took this film from a potential success to a steaming pile of horse apples. This was directed by Roman Polanski, whose experience with the Holocaust makes the topic of human rights a personal matter. In the background is a human rights commission to examine torture and murder between 1975-1980 with Weaver's husband as the head and her as a skeptic, thinking the whole thing is a "whitewash". She works, inadvertently, to sabotage it. "You can never entirely possess the female soul." This quote appears, attributed to Nietzsche. What is its significance?

    The movie script of "Death and the Maiden" is originated from a screenplay with the same name by Ariel Dorfman from Chile. This script has a great structure. The wife is listening to the radio while cooking the dinner. The news on the radio tells about foundation of a committee for investigation about tortures and crimes of the previous dictatorship naming someone as the head of this committee. The unusual attention of the wife leads the movie viewers to suppose a relation between the wife and those phenomena. The electricity went off. The fear of the wife might be because of hearing the thunderstorm or remembering past horrors. The wife ran quickly to a battery radio to continue listening to the news. Here, the viewer became sure about the importance of the news. The nervous attitude of the wife, going under the rain, smoking a cigarette and taking a gun by seeing a coming vehicle, either show this. Then, something else happens. The husband introduces himself to the vehicle driver - the doctor- and the viewers figure out that he is the head of the committee. This causes the viewers to forget their previous conclusions and think that the main reason of the wife's reactions is hearing her husband's name. While thinking about this, the dialogs between the couple return the viewers back to the first conclusion. The movie keeps the viewers in a reciprocating situation, which continues along the story. The husband thinks he knows everything about his wife's prison but figures out it was not. The wife gains new information about a sexual relation between his husband and another girl during her prison time and the viewers us not sure about the guilt of the doctor. This uncertainty is smartly placed in the script. In the other side, the battery radio used to show the importance of the news in the beginning of the film, was utilized again in the middle to prove the crime of the doctor without any encounter to went off electricity and plays the "Death and the Maiden" piece to show the title of the film.

    (Though this doesn't contain all surprises or, ah hem, spoilers, it does borderline it. #1 just watch the movie  it is a near-masterpiece, a near perfect suspense thriller/mystery everyone (of age) should see. #2 then read my review. It's very hard to write about it without giving away too much.) It was more of a crime that Weaver was neither nominated nor won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1994 than the crimes committed against her in the movie, Death and the Maiden. Okay, that's taking it a bit far; what happened to her character was unmistakably HORRIBLE, but she still should've won something for her fantastic post-victim performance. And it was a further crime hardly anyone saw this near-masterpiece of a small/indie film that screams stage play. In fact, when I first saw this many years ago, aside from being immediately enthralled in the story and acting of Weaver, my first reaction was this was meant for the stage  and this was before I did find out, in fact, it was previously a theatre production. What we have here, in one of my all-time favorite movies, is paranoid Paulina (Weaver) living in isolation with her lawyer-husband, Gerardo (Wilson) in a South American now-"supposedly" free country. Gerardo had a flat, was late for dinner and Paulina's p|ssed..but it's not clear up front on why. Slowly, but absolutely surelythe pieces fall into place, ever so deliberately on why she's both paranoid and p|ssed. But as bad of a life she makes you believe she hasthe past is about to make things a little worst. Gerardo had a Good Samaritan for his flat tire in the form of Dr. Miranda (Kingsley) and upon the doctor's admiration for the lawyer who's about to work for the President on anti-torture criminals  and a few drinks  Paulina's senses go into overdrive. She is absolutely sure the voice and even smell from the other room where she's "pretending to be sleeping" that the good ole doc was her captive from awhile back. I really don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say, she was kidnapped prior to the movie started and Pauline believes this stranger was (one of) her torturer(s). Eventually, she's going to make him prove he did it, or his innocence. One way or another. Literally, I am going to stop here. I've given away only 5% of the movie, and I feel that's too much. This movie, with literally only three actors, plays out in deep mystery and suspense and you will feel every bit of the pain Weaver wants you to. She is an astonishing actress and proves it here. You would need to be in a 3-person movie. The other two, Kingsley and Wilson, were also good, but this is Weaver's show. Her and her character's redemption or potential healing. It won't take too much of your time  it's relatively short, but it will be worth seeing this wonderful movie and you will see past Ripley (Alien). (Actually, a little too much, at times. Boy, Weaver wanted to get naked for this movie)

    Films like this generally are problematic. They are written as plays and kept as plays when carried over, so the filmmaker is limited to a preset notion of the space. "Rope" was taken as a challenge in this regard, with a master visionary exploiting the confinement. It was, in effect, a learning experience for him without much reward for us, beyond what the play itself carried. Here in this film, we have something similar I believe. Polanski is a rare talent, a filmmaker that understands confinement  indeed his whole life is defined by the concept. He was approached to direct-for-hire and took the job, I believe, because he wanted a similar learning experience. So what we have here is a screenplay that was frozen before the man started his film and which he has taken unaltered. Someone else selected the actors, making what I think were bad choices. On this, Polanski designed the eye, making what I see as a whole different movie on top of the play. The play is about a woman who had been victimized by state torture. She believes she has encountered her torturer; the film is about the encounter and the extent to which you can trust her narrative or the accused. Her husband presides; he is literally a lawyer selected by the new president to sort out just these sorts of conflicting truths. The question is: will the accused confess? Well he does before the film is over, but was his confession true? Neither one of these two gives us much reason to trust them as characters. They both are liars. What Polanski does is subtly more the stance of the camera so that we alternate between who is the narrator so far as the lines compared to who is the aligned watcher and whose narrative space is tentatively trusted. It is a remarkable exercise, of just the kind that he would devour. I believe he used these skills in a similar weave of untrusted narrative in his next film, "Gate," which I think is an unappreciated masterpiece. But unless you happen to be tuned into this movie on a movie, this narrative about narrative, you will find this a pretty tame encounter. Unless you happen to live in a country that sponsors torture. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    A woman seeks revenge from a man she recognizes as a government official who tortured and raped her years ago for her political views. Based on a play, the setting could have been post-WWII Germany with a Jewish woman going against her Nazi persecutor. However, it is set in an unnamed South American country. There are only three characters and most of the action takes place on a single set, but Polanski manages to sustain the tension throughout. Weaver is convincing as the vengeful woman. Wilson and Kingsley are fine as her husband and the man she accuses of war crimes, respectively. The title comes from Schubert's 14th string quartet, which was played every time Weaver was raped.

    We hear about it all the time; people have been harmed in the most unspeakable ways, causing pain that most of us cannot begin to even imagine. If this happened to you, what would you do if the person who hurt you walked into your house? This kind of moral quagmire has been approached before in films. Many times, in fact. The torture angle is new though. Unfortunately, that's all that's new about this story. But this is the situation that one woman, Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), an ex-activist who was horrifically tortured in order to give up the name of a fellow activist (who later became her husband), finds herself in, when a man (Ben Kingsley) is invited into their home after helping her husband (Stuart Wilson). She is convinced that this man, Dr. Miranda, is the one who brutalized her. He denies it, of course. And her husband, now a high-powered lawyer, is caught in the middle. This film could have gone in two opposite directions: a high-powered, claustrophobic thriller or a leadened message movie. Fortunately, it's not the latter (no one is going to mistake this movie for a UNICEF infomercial), but sadly, it's not the former either. It's somewhere in the middle. There are moments of where it works, but overall it's pretty boring. Part of the reason is that the most important part is miscast. Sigourney Weaver is a good actress, but she's not right for this role. She has moments of effectiveness (Weaver is good at being vulnerable), but when she tries to act menacing, she's awful. Ben Kingsley is terrific, though, as the may-or-may not be torturer. He keeps us on our toes, and we never know whether or not he's innocent. Noted character actor Stuart Wilson is actually able to keep up with the Oscar-winner and Oscar-nominee. The problem isn't necessarily with Roman Polanski's approach. "Death and the Maiden" is heavy on the atmosphere, although it could have used some more claustrophobia to increase the tension. The problem is that the script, based on the play, is rather bland. There's nothing that really draws us into the story, and it doesn't take any risks. Thus what could have been a powerful and provocative drama or thriller (take your pick) becomes inert.

    A political activist (Sigourney Weaver) is convinced that her guest (Ben Kingsley) is a man who once tortured her for the government. Sigourney Weaver topless, not something I ever needed to see. She plays a nut case and I hate her even more than usual in this film. The worst torture I can imagine is having Weaver's used panties stuffed in my mouth. Also, her acting is really, really, really bad. Her casting took this film from a potential success to a steaming pile of horse apples. This was directed by Roman Polanski, whose experience with the Holocaust makes the topic of human rights a personal matter. In the background is a human rights commission to examine torture and murder between 1975-1980 with Weaver's husband as the head and her as a skeptic, thinking the whole thing is a "whitewash". She works, inadvertently, to sabotage it. "You can never entirely possess the female soul." This quote appears, attributed to Nietzsche. What is its significance?

    The movie script of "Death and the Maiden" is originated from a screenplay with the same name by Ariel Dorfman from Chile. This script has a great structure. The wife is listening to the radio while cooking the dinner. The news on the radio tells about foundation of a committee for investigation about tortures and crimes of the previous dictatorship naming someone as the head of this committee. The unusual attention of the wife leads the movie viewers to suppose a relation between the wife and those phenomena. The electricity went off. The fear of the wife might be because of hearing the thunderstorm or remembering past horrors. The wife ran quickly to a battery radio to continue listening to the news. Here, the viewer became sure about the importance of the news. The nervous attitude of the wife, going under the rain, smoking a cigarette and taking a gun by seeing a coming vehicle, either show this. Then, something else happens. The husband introduces himself to the vehicle driver - the doctor- and the viewers figure out that he is the head of the committee. This causes the viewers to forget their previous conclusions and think that the main reason of the wife's reactions is hearing her husband's name. While thinking about this, the dialogs between the couple return the viewers back to the first conclusion. The movie keeps the viewers in a reciprocating situation, which continues along the story. The husband thinks he knows everything about his wife's prison but figures out it was not. The wife gains new information about a sexual relation between his husband and another girl during her prison time and the viewers us not sure about the guilt of the doctor. This uncertainty is smartly placed in the script. In the other side, the battery radio used to show the importance of the news in the beginning of the film, was utilized again in the middle to prove the crime of the doctor without any encounter to went off electricity and plays the "Death and the Maiden" piece to show the title of the film.

    (Though this doesn't contain all surprises or, ah hem, spoilers, it does borderline it. #1 just watch the movie  it is a near-masterpiece, a near perfect suspense thriller/mystery everyone (of age) should see. #2 then read my review. It's very hard to write about it without giving away too much.) It was more of a crime that Weaver was neither nominated nor won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1994 than the crimes committed against her in the movie, Death and the Maiden. Okay, that's taking it a bit far; what happened to her character was unmistakably HORRIBLE, but she still should've won something for her fantastic post-victim performance. And it was a further crime hardly anyone saw this near-masterpiece of a small/indie film that screams stage play. In fact, when I first saw this many years ago, aside from being immediately enthralled in the story and acting of Weaver, my first reaction was this was meant for the stage  and this was before I did find out, in fact, it was previously a theatre production. What we have here, in one of my all-time favorite movies, is paranoid Paulina (Weaver) living in isolation with her lawyer-husband, Gerardo (Wilson) in a South American now-"supposedly" free country. Gerardo had a flat, was late for dinner and Paulina's p|ssed..but it's not clear up front on why. Slowly, but absolutely surelythe pieces fall into place, ever so deliberately on why she's both paranoid and p|ssed. But as bad of a life she makes you believe she hasthe past is about to make things a little worst. Gerardo had a Good Samaritan for his flat tire in the form of Dr. Miranda (Kingsley) and upon the doctor's admiration for the lawyer who's about to work for the President on anti-torture criminals  and a few drinks  Paulina's senses go into overdrive. She is absolutely sure the voice and even smell from the other room where she's "pretending to be sleeping" that the good ole doc was her captive from awhile back. I really don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say, she was kidnapped prior to the movie started and Pauline believes this stranger was (one of) her torturer(s). Eventually, she's going to make him prove he did it, or his innocence. One way or another. Literally, I am going to stop here. I've given away only 5% of the movie, and I feel that's too much. This movie, with literally only three actors, plays out in deep mystery and suspense and you will feel every bit of the pain Weaver wants you to. She is an astonishing actress and proves it here. You would need to be in a 3-person movie. The other two, Kingsley and Wilson, were also good, but this is Weaver's show. Her and her character's redemption or potential healing. It won't take too much of your time  it's relatively short, but it will be worth seeing this wonderful movie and you will see past Ripley (Alien). (Actually, a little too much, at times. Boy, Weaver wanted to get naked for this movie)

    Films like this generally are problematic. They are written as plays and kept as plays when carried over, so the filmmaker is limited to a preset notion of the space. "Rope" was taken as a challenge in this regard, with a master visionary exploiting the confinement. It was, in effect, a learning experience for him without much reward for us, beyond what the play itself carried. Here in this film, we have something similar I believe. Polanski is a rare talent, a filmmaker that understands confinement  indeed his whole life is defined by the concept. He was approached to direct-for-hire and took the job, I believe, because he wanted a similar learning experience. So what we have here is a screenplay that was frozen before the man started his film and which he has taken unaltered. Someone else selected the actors, making what I think were bad choices. On this, Polanski designed the eye, making what I see as a whole different movie on top of the play. The play is about a woman who had been victimized by state torture. She believes she has encountered her torturer; the film is about the encounter and the extent to which you can trust her narrative or the accused. Her husband presides; he is literally a lawyer selected by the new president to sort out just these sorts of conflicting truths. The question is: will the accused confess? Well he does before the film is over, but was his confession true? Neither one of these two gives us much reason to trust them as characters. They both are liars. What Polanski does is subtly more the stance of the camera so that we alternate between who is the narrator so far as the lines compared to who is the aligned watcher and whose narrative space is tentatively trusted. It is a remarkable exercise, of just the kind that he would devour. I believe he used these skills in a similar weave of untrusted narrative in his next film, "Gate," which I think is an unappreciated masterpiece. But unless you happen to be tuned into this movie on a movie, this narrative about narrative, you will find this a pretty tame encounter. Unless you happen to live in a country that sponsors torture.

    A woman seeks revenge from a man she recognizes as a government official who tortured and raped her years ago for her political views. Based on a play, the setting could have been post-WWII Germany with a Jewish woman going against her Nazi persecutor. However, it is set in an unnamed South American country. There are only three characters and most of the action takes place on a single set, but Polanski manages to sustain the tension throughout. Weaver is convincing as the vengeful woman. Wilson and Kingsley are fine as her husband and the man she accuses of war crimes, respectively. The title comes from Schubert's 14th string quartet, which was played every time Weaver was raped.

    We hear about it all the time; people have been harmed in the most unspeakable ways, causing pain that most of us cannot begin to even imagine. If this happened to you, what would you do if the person who hurt you walked into your house? This kind of moral quagmire has been approached before in films. Many times, in fact. The torture angle is new though. Unfortunately, that's all that's new about this story. But this is the situation that one woman, Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), an ex-activist who was horrifically tortured in order to give up the name of a fellow activist (who later became her husband), finds herself in, when a man (Ben Kingsley) is invited into their home after helping her husband (Stuart Wilson). She is convinced that this man, Dr. Miranda, is the one who brutalized her. He denies it, of course. And her husband, now a high-powered lawyer, is caught in the middle. This film could have gone in two opposite directions: a high-powered, claustrophobic thriller or a leadened message movie. Fortunately, it's not the latter (no one is going to mistake this movie for a UNICEF infomercial), but sadly, it's not the former either. It's somewhere in the middle. There are moments of where it works, but overall it's pretty boring. Part of the reason is that the most important part is miscast. Sigourney Weaver is a good actress, but she's not right for this role. She has moments of effectiveness (Weaver is good at being vulnerable), but when she tries to act menacing, she's awful. Ben Kingsley is terrific, though, as the may-or-may not be torturer. He keeps us on our toes, and we never know whether or not he's innocent. Noted character actor Stuart Wilson is actually able to keep up with the Oscar-winner and Oscar-nominee. The problem isn't necessarily with Roman Polanski's approach. "Death and the Maiden" is heavy on the atmosphere, although it could have used some more claustrophobia to increase the tension. The problem is that the script, based on the play, is rather bland. There's nothing that really draws us into the story, and it doesn't take any risks. Thus what could have been a powerful and provocative drama or thriller (take your pick) becomes inert. It's not a total waste; the film effectively keeps us guessing who's telling the truth. But the suspense isn't there, even though it has plenty of opportunity to build. However, the ending of the film is horrible. What happens not only doesn't make sense, it's actually more than slightly reprehensible. This isn't a bad film, just a wasted opportunity.

    This is one of the cinematic homes for this filmmaker. He swims comfortably in these waters. Polanski requires very little elements to induce great tension in any film. That's why he has looked for scripts like this, often in his career. This is a great thing, the ability to take very few scenery elements, in this case a single very small house, and the surrounding landscape, and build the narrative over that. Because that's what we have. The story is simple enough to produce no distractions, and the landscape is wide and desert enough to do the same. What we have is a whole set up that surrounds an idea of uncertain truth, provisional reality (to our eyes). That's why we never stop wondering whether Weaver is right or wrong, whether Kingsley is a rapist or a victim. So does Stuart Wilson, who goes through the same range of doubt as we, spectators, go, and that makes him our surrogate in the film. We are judges to our own sentence. All the cruelty of an invented regime of a supposed south American country is the mere formalization of the credibility of the world. It is not about denouncing crimes nor about discussing politics, as it has been said. Also, much has been said about how much the final monologue reveals the truth, i say it keeps all the possibilities opened, though it suggests sincerity. As an idea, this is as simple as it gets, and as every simple idea, it's so hard to achieve, keeping it simple. That's where things get interesting, when you check the cinematic devices that surround and collaborate with the simplicity of a simple doubt that this theatrical script suggests. First we have the core of the story framed, at beginning and end, by the core music, a quartet which names the film, and gives consistency to the drama of Sigourney's character. We have the handling of the wide open landscape, with its lighthouse. The sense of green isolation, the poetics of the location, which growths on us, as it is given in small bits, until becoming the final stage to the real drama. The house. This part matters, as this a film by a director who really knows how to handle space and include it in the drama. This is worth for a hotel room, a boat, or a small house. This is what he has been making throughout his life, in "knife in the water", his apartment trilogy, bitter moon and this one. It is something i admire, the ability to include the space that surrounds the characters into their dramas and discussions. That's one way, one of deepest ways to include (architectural) space in the fields of cinema. Orson Welles, Hitchcock (sometimes), Polanski... they all trust on their own camera. We have the acting at the center of the success of this film. Everyone of the 3 actors involved play at their top here, each one knows where he stands, and interprets perfectly what is required of him to make things flow. Ambiguity, to Ben Kinsgley, Messed up mind to Sigourney Weaver, Reactiveness and indecision to Stuart Wilson. This is less achieved than other efforts, but Roman never ceases to deliver his special gaze, and that's always worth seeing. My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    One of the most outstanding elements about Roman Polanski's films is the tension in atmosphere and between the characters. The director has consistently succeeded in drawing the viewer by creating tension. Moreover, his use of dark themes and the lesser known add further appeal. After all, who isn't curious about the dark? Polanski also makes full use of what he's got, starting from the cast to the most basic of props. 95% of 'Death and the Maiden' was shot consecutively (in accordance with the script) which couldn't have been an easy thing to do if time and money are constraints. The film only has three actors and each one performs superbly. Ben Kingsley's disturbing and chilling portrayal of a sleazy sadistic doctor lingers in mind. Stuart Wilson is brilliant as the ambivalent lawyer torn between his beliefs. This is also a pleasant turn from the villainous characters he's more famous for. Sigourney Weaver is spellbinding as the former prisoner who finally gets the opportunity to seek her own justice. Polanski tactfully brings forth political and psychological issues without preaching to the audience. some minor flawed issues were the lighting. I felt it was too strong in places (where the only source of light was candles). It looks like there was some poor green screen filtering in a few of the outdoor scenes even though I don't think a green screen was used. However, these faults are too minor when viewing the film as a whole. 'Death and the Maiden'is a simple but engaging and haunting story told through the perspective of three complex characters. It's one of Polanski's finest.

    When Ariel Dorfman's play Death and the Maiden, about a victim of rape and torture in a post-fascist regime coming face-to-face with one of her tormentors, was adapted for the screen, it is perhaps no surprise that the project was snapped up by director Roman Polanski. This is story which is both startlingly sensitive and understanding towards victims of rape, and yet one which also reserves a crumb of sympathy for the perpetrator. Two decades after his own conviction for sex crimes, Polanski's decision to make this movie poses the question. Is this the director's apology, or his attempt at self-absolution? Death and the Maiden is, in the first place, a powerful and thoughtful work, on the one hand an exploration of the nature of justice, of justice that satisfies the law and justice that satisfies the individual. And on the other, it is a look at the differences between male and female approaches to love, sex and control. It is in this latter it is at its boldest and most eloquent, even if it does equivocate. There are numerous points in the dialogue which are deeply poignant simply due to the aching truth of them. The power Dorfman's words are carried through to the screen intact. This is in no small part thanks to a flawless cast. Sigourney Weaver gives an understated yet resonant performance that gives every impression that she has really lived what her character has gone through. In her flashes of anger she brings a touch of masculinity to the part, and there is perhaps something of her trying to take on the doctor's identity in the role. Ben Kingsley is of that new breed of chameleonic actors who are able to transform themselves completely for a range of roles. Here he presents numerous facets of his character  friendliness, erudition, vulnerability, spite, and an eventual coldness, all with realistic fluidity. Stuart Wilson gives a worthy if rather bland performance, which is exactly what's needed, as being the least important of the cast he must not overshadow the other two. While Polanski's own offences should not be considered lightly, I have always tried to judge his work (which I often enjoy) separately to his deeds. He does a fair job here, using some intense long takes for key scenes, and creating various different spaces to help us forget how limited the setting is. The pacing is marvellous, and despite being a talky stage adaptation the movie simply races along. And yet, in the context of Polanski's involvement, its final scenes have a slightly sickening, almost pathetic edge. Finally however, my interpretation of the ending is not that Paulina chose to forgive the doctor, but that what she needed for closure was to hear his explanation.

    Story: Emotionally disturbed wife of a human rights activist and minister of justice to be wakes up in night and hears her husband speaking to an unknown man. In his voice she recognizes a doctor who tortured and raped during the reign of military junta. She attacks him in night, ties him up and under a gunpoint she decides to proceed with a trial. Her husband must reluctantly go what she wants. And so trial which will affect all three protagonists for ever begins. Acting: Breathtaking, acting in this film is incredibly intense. All three actors are great and are believable in their roles. Direction and camera: Again as with acting the films is very intense in the feeling, it is slow but creepy and keeps viewer in doubts right to the end. Music: There is not much music in this film, I remember only the "Death and the maiden" which is of course beautiful. Conclusion: Great film with great acting and atmosphere.

If this happened to you, what would you do if the person who hurt you walked into your house? This kind of moral quagmire has been approached before in films. Many times, in fact. The torture angle is new though. Unfortunately, that's all that's new about this story. But this is the situation that one woman, Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), an ex-activist who was horrifically tortured in order to give up the name of a fellow activist (who later became her husband), finds herself in, when a man (Ben Kingsley) is invited into their home after helping her husband (Stuart Wilson). She is convinced that this man, Dr. Miranda, is the one who brutalized her. He denies it, of course. And her husband, now a high-powered lawyer, is caught in the middle. This film could have gone in two opposite directions: a high-powered, claustrophobic thriller or a leadened message movie. Fortunately, it's not the latter (no one is going to mistake this movie for a UNICEF infomercial), but sadly, it's not the former either. It's somewhere in the middle. There are moments of where it works, but overall it's pretty boring. Part of the reason is that the most important part is miscast. Sigourney Weaver is a good actress, but she's not right for this role. She has moments of effectiveness (Weaver is good at being vulnerable), but when she tries to act menacing, she's awful. Ben Kingsley is terrific, though, as the may-or-may not be torturer. He keeps us on our toes, and we never know whether or not he's innocent. Noted character actor Stuart Wilson is actually able to keep up with the Oscar-winner and Oscar-nominee. The problem isn't necessarily with Roman Polanski's approach. "Death and the Maiden" is heavy on the atmosphere, although it could have used some more claustrophobia to increase the tension. The problem is that the script, based on the play, is rather bland. There's nothing that really draws us into the story, and it doesn't take any risks. Thus what could have been a powerful and provocative drama or thriller (take your pick) becomes inert. It's not a total waste; the film effectively keeps us guessing who's telling the truth. But the suspense isn't there, even though it has plenty of opportunity to build. However, the ending of the film is horrible. What happens not only doesn't make sense, it's actually more than slightly reprehensible. This isn't a bad film, just a wasted opportunity.

    This is one of the cinematic homes for this filmmaker. He swims comfortably in these waters. Polanski requires very little elements to induce great tension in any film. That's why he has looked for scripts like this, often in his career. This is a great thing, the ability to take very few scenery elements, in this case a single very small house, and the surrounding landscape, and build the narrative over that. Because that's what we have. The story is simple enough to produce no distractions, and the landscape is wide and desert enough to do the same. What we have is a whole set up that surrounds an idea of uncertain truth, provisional reality (to our eyes). That's why we never stop wondering whether Weaver is right or wrong, whether Kingsley is a rapist or a victim. So does Stuart Wilson, who goes through the same range of doubt as we, spectators, go, and that makes him our surrogate in the film. We are judges to our own sentence. All the cruelty of an invented regime of a supposed south American country is the mere formalization of the credibility of the world. It is not about denouncing crimes nor about discussing politics, as it has been said. Also, much has been said about how much the final monologue reveals the truth, i say it keeps all the possibilities opened, though it suggests sincerity. As an idea, this is as simple as it gets, and as every simple idea, it's so hard to achieve, keeping it simple. That's where things get interesting, when you check the cinematic devices that surround and collaborate with the simplicity of a simple doubt that this theatrical script suggests. First we have the core of the story framed, at beginning and end, by the core music, a quartet which names the film, and gives consistency to the drama of Sigourney's character. We have the handling of the wide open landscape, with its lighthouse. The sense of green isolation, the poetics of the location, which growths on us, as it is given in small bits, until becoming the final stage to the real drama. The house. This part matters, as this a film by a director who really knows how to handle space and include it in the drama. This is worth for a hotel room, a boat, or a small house. This is what he has been making throughout his life, in "knife in the water", his apartment trilogy, bitter moon and this one. It is something i admire, the ability to include the space that surrounds the characters into their dramas and discussions. That's one way, one of deepest ways to include (architectural) space in the fields of cinema. Orson Welles, Hitchcock (sometimes), Polanski... they all trust on their own camera. We have the acting at the center of the success of this film. Everyone of the 3 actors involved play at their top here, each one knows where he stands, and interprets perfectly what is required of him to make things flow. Ambiguity, to Ben Kinsgley, Messed up mind to Sigourney Weaver, Reactiveness and indecision to Stuart Wilson. This is less achieved than other efforts, but Roman never ceases to deliver his special gaze, and that's always worth seeing. My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    One of the most outstanding elements about Roman Polanski's films is the tension in atmosphere and between the characters. The director has consistently succeeded in drawing the viewer by creating tension. Moreover, his use of dark themes and the lesser known add further appeal. After all, who isn't curious about the dark? Polanski also makes full use of what he's got, starting from the cast to the most basic of props. 95% of 'Death and the Maiden' was shot consecutively (in accordance with the script) which couldn't have been an easy thing to do if time and money are constraints. The film only has three actors and each one performs superbly. Ben Kingsley's disturbing and chilling portrayal of a sleazy sadistic doctor lingers in mind. Stuart Wilson is brilliant as the ambivalent lawyer torn between his beliefs. This is also a pleasant turn from the villainous characters he's more famous for. Sigourney Weaver is spellbinding as the former prisoner who finally gets the opportunity to seek her own justice. Polanski tactfully brings forth political and psychological issues without preaching to the audience. some minor flawed issues were the lighting. I felt it was too strong in places (where the only source of light was candles). It looks like there was some poor green screen filtering in a few of the outdoor scenes even though I don't think a green screen was used. However, these faults are too minor when viewing the film as a whole. 'Death and the Maiden'is a simple but engaging and haunting story told through the perspective of three complex characters. It's one of Polanski's finest.

    When Ariel Dorfman's play Death and the Maiden, about a victim of rape and torture in a post-fascist regime coming face-to-face with one of her tormentors, was adapted for the screen, it is perhaps no surprise that the project was snapped up by director Roman Polanski. This is story which is both startlingly sensitive and understanding towards victims of rape, and yet one which also reserves a crumb of sympathy for the perpetrator. Two decades after his own conviction for sex crimes, Polanski's decision to make this movie poses the question. Is this the director's apology, or his attempt at self-absolution? Death and the Maiden is, in the first place, a powerful and thoughtful work, on the one hand an exploration of the nature of justice, of justice that satisfies the law and justice that satisfies the individual. And on the other, it is a look at the differences between male and female approaches to love, sex and control. It is in this latter it is at its boldest and most eloquent, even if it does equivocate. There are numerous points in the dialogue which are deeply poignant simply due to the aching truth of them. The power Dorfman's words are carried through to the screen intact. This is in no small part thanks to a flawless cast. Sigourney Weaver gives an understated yet resonant performance that gives every impression that she has really lived what her character has gone through. In her flashes of anger she brings a touch of masculinity to the part, and there is perhaps something of her trying to take on the doctor's identity in the role. Ben Kingsley is of that new breed of chameleonic actors who are able to transform themselves completely for a range of roles. Here he presents numerous facets of his character  friendliness, erudition, vulnerability, spite, and an eventual coldness, all with realistic fluidity. Stuart Wilson gives a worthy if rather bland performance, which is exactly what's needed, as being the least important of the cast he must not overshadow the other two. While Polanski's own offences should not be considered lightly, I have always tried to judge his work (which I often enjoy) separately to his deeds. He does a fair job here, using some intense long takes for key scenes, and creating various different spaces to help us forget how limited the setting is. The pacing is marvellous, and despite being a talky stage adaptation the movie simply races along. And yet, in the context of Polanski's involvement, its final scenes have a slightly sickening, almost pathetic edge. Finally however, my interpretation of the ending is not that Paulina chose to forgive the doctor, but that what she needed for closure was to hear his explanation.

    Story: Emotionally disturbed wife of a human rights activist and minister of justice to be wakes up in night and hears her husband speaking to an unknown man. In his voice she recognizes a doctor who tortured and raped during the reign of military junta. She attacks him in night, ties him up and under a gunpoint she decides to proceed with a trial. Her husband must reluctantly go what she wants. And so trial which will affect all three protagonists for ever begins. Acting: Breathtaking, acting in this film is incredibly intense. All three actors are great and are believable in their roles. Direction and camera: Again as with acting the films is very intense in the feeling, it is slow but creepy and keeps viewer in doubts right to the end. Music: There is not much music in this film, I remember only the "Death and the maiden" which is of course beautiful. Conclusion: Great film with great acting and atmosphere.

    A political activist (Sigourney Weaver) is convinced that her guest (Ben Kingsley) is a man who once tortured her for the government. Sigourney Weaver topless, not something I ever needed to see. She plays a nut case and I hate her even more than usual in this film. The worst torture I can imagine is having Weaver's used panties stuffed in my mouth. Also, her acting is really, really, really bad. Her casting took this film from a potential success to a steaming pile of horse apples. This was directed by Roman Polanski, whose experience with the Holocaust makes the topic of human rights a personal matter. In the background is a human rights commission to examine torture and murder between 1975-1980 with Weaver's husband as the head and her as a skeptic, thinking the whole thing is a "whitewash". She works, inadvertently, to sabotage it. "You can never entirely possess the female soul." This quote appears, attributed to Nietzsche. What is its significance?

    The movie script of "Death and the Maiden" is originated from a screenplay with the same name by Ariel Dorfman from Chile. This script has a great structure. The wife is listening to the radio while cooking the dinner. The news on the radio tells about foundation of a committee for investigation about tortures and crimes of the previous dictatorship naming someone as the head of this committee. The unusual attention of the wife leads the movie viewers to suppose a relation between the wife and those phenomena. The electricity went off. The fear of the wife might be because of hearing the thunderstorm or remembering past horrors. The wife ran quickly to a battery radio to continue listening to the news. Here, the viewer became sure about the importance of the news. The nervous attitude of the wife, going under the rain, smoking a cigarette and taking a gun by seeing a coming vehicle, either show this. Then, something else happens. The husband introduces himself to the vehicle driver - the doctor- and the viewers figure out that he is the head of the committee. This causes the viewers to forget their previous conclusions and think that the main reason of the wife's reactions is hearing her husband's name. While thinking about this, the dialogs between the couple return the viewers back to the first conclusion. The movie keeps the viewers in a reciprocating situation, which continues along the story. The husband thinks he knows everything about his wife's prison but figures out it was not. The wife gains new information about a sexual relation between his husband and another girl during her prison time and the viewers us not sure about the guilt of the doctor. This uncertainty is smartly placed in the script. In the other side, the battery radio used to show the importance of the news in the beginning of the film, was utilized again in the middle to prove the crime of the doctor without any encounter to went off electricity and plays the "Death and the Maiden" piece to show the title of the film.

    (Though this doesn't contain all surprises or, ah hem, spoilers, it does borderline it. #1 just watch the movie  it is a near-masterpiece, a near perfect suspense thriller/mystery everyone (of age) should see. #2 then read my review. It's very hard to write about it without giving away too much.) It was more of a crime that Weaver was neither nominated nor won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1994 than the crimes committed against her in the movie, Death and the Maiden. Okay, that's taking it a bit far; what happened to her character was unmistakably HORRIBLE, but she still should've won something for her fantastic post-victim performance. And it was a further crime hardly anyone saw this near-masterpiece of a small/indie film that screams stage play. In fact, when I first saw this many years ago, aside from being immediately enthralled in the story and acting of Weaver, my first reaction was this was meant for the stage  and this was before I did find out, in fact, it was previously a theatre production. What we have here, in one of my all-time favorite movies, is paranoid Paulina (Weaver) living in isolation with her lawyer-husband, Gerardo (Wilson) in a South American now-"supposedly" free country. Gerardo had a flat, was late for dinner and Paulina's p|ssed..but it's not clear up front on why. Slowly, but absolutely surelythe pieces fall into place, ever so deliberately on why she's both paranoid and p|ssed. But as bad of a life she makes you believe she hasthe past is about to make things a little worst. Gerardo had a Good Samaritan for his flat tire in the form of Dr. Miranda (Kingsley) and upon the doctor's admiration for the lawyer who's about to work for the President on anti-torture criminals  and a few drinks  Paulina's senses go into overdrive. She is absolutely sure the voice and even smell from the other room where she's "pretending to be sleeping" that the good ole doc was her captive from awhile back. I really don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say, she was kidnapped prior to the movie started and Pauline believes this stranger was (one of) her torturer(s). Eventually, she's going to make him prove he did it, or his innocence. One way or another. Literally, I am going to stop here. I've given away only 5% of the movie, and I feel that's too much. This movie, with literally only three actors, plays out in deep mystery and suspense and you will feel every bit of the pain Weaver wants you to. She is an astonishing actress and proves it here. You would need to be in a 3-person movie. The other two, Kingsley and Wilson, were also good, but this is Weaver's show. Her and her character's redemption or potential healing. It won't take too much of your time  it's relatively short, but it will be worth seeing this wonderful movie and you will see past Ripley (Alien). (Actually, a little too much, at times. Boy, Weaver wanted to get naked for this movie)

    Films like this generally are problematic. They are written as plays and kept as plays when carried over, so the filmmaker is limited to a preset notion of the space. "Rope" was taken as a challenge in this regard, with a master visionary exploiting the confinement. It was, in effect, a learning experience for him without much reward for us, beyond what the play itself carried. Here in this film, we have something similar I believe. Polanski is a rare talent, a filmmaker that understands confinement  indeed his whole life is defined by the concept. He was approached to direct-for-hire and took the job, I believe, because he wanted a similar learning experience. So what we have here is a screenplay that was frozen before the man started his film and which he has taken unaltered. Someone else selected the actors, making what I think were bad choices. On this, Polanski designed the eye, making what I see as a whole different movie on top of the play. The play is about a woman who had been victimized by state torture. She believes she has encountered her torturer; the film is about the encounter and the extent to which you can trust her narrative or the accused. Her husband presides; he is literally a lawyer selected by the new president to sort out just these sorts of conflicting truths. The question is: will the accused confess? Well he does before the film is over, but was his confession true? Neither one of these two gives us much reason to trust them as characters. They both are liars. What Polanski does is subtly more the stance of the camera so that we alternate between who is the narrator so far as the lines compared to who is the aligned watcher and whose narrative space is tentatively trusted. It is a remarkable exercise, of just the kind that he would devour. I believe he used these skills in a similar weave of untrusted narrative in his next film, "Gate," which I think is an unappreciated masterpiece. But unless you happen to be tuned into this movie on a movie, this narrative about narrative, you will find this a pretty tame encounter. Unless you happen to live in a country that sponsors torture. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    A woman seeks revenge from a man she recognizes as a government official who tortured and raped her years ago for her political views. Based on a play, the setting could have been post-WWII Germany with a Jewish woman going against her Nazi persecutor. However, it is set in an unnamed South American country. There are only three characters and most of the action takes place on a single set, but Polanski manages to sustain the tension throughout. Weaver is convincing as the vengeful woman. Wilson and Kingsley are fine as her husband and the man she accuses of war crimes, respectively. The title comes from Schubert's 14th string quartet, which was played every time Weaver was raped.

    Story: Emotionally disturbed wife of a human rights activist and minister of justice to be wakes up in night and hears her husband speaking to an unknown man. In his voice she recognizes a doctor who tortured and raped during the reign of military junta. She attacks him in night, ties him up and under a gunpoint she decides to proceed with a trial. Her husband must reluctantly go what she wants. And so trial which will affect all three protagonists for ever begins. Acting: Breathtaking, acting in this film is incredibly intense. All three actors are great and are believable in their roles. Direction and camera: Again as with acting the films is very intense in the feeling, it is slow but creepy and keeps viewer in doubts right to the end. Music: There is not much music in this film, I remember only the "Death and the maiden" which is of course beautiful. Conclusion: Great film with great acting and atmosphere.

    A political activist (Sigourney Weaver) is convinced that her guest (Ben Kingsley) is a man who once tortured her for the government. Sigourney Weaver topless, not something I ever needed to see. She plays a nut case and I hate her even more than usual in this film. The worst torture I can imagine is having Weaver's used panties stuffed in my mouth. Also, her acting is really, really, really bad. Her casting took this film from a potential success to a steaming pile of horse apples. This was directed by Roman Polanski, whose experience with the Holocaust makes the topic of human rights a personal matter. In the background is a human rights commission to examine torture and murder between 1975-1980 with Weaver's husband as the head and her as a skeptic, thinking the whole thing is a "whitewash". She works, inadvertently, to sabotage it. "You can never entirely possess the female soul." This quote appears, attributed to Nietzsche. What is its significance?

    The movie script of "Death and the Maiden" is originated from a screenplay with the same name by Ariel Dorfman from Chile. This script has a great structure. The wife is listening to the radio while cooking the dinner. The news on the radio tells about foundation of a committee for investigation about tortures and crimes of the previous dictatorship naming someone as the head of this committee. The unusual attention of the wife leads the movie viewers to suppose a relation between the wife and those phenomena. The electricity went off. The fear of the wife might be because of hearing the thunderstorm or remembering past horrors. The wife ran quickly to a battery radio to continue listening to the news. Here, the viewer became sure about the importance of the news. The nervous attitude of the wife, going under the rain, smoking a cigarette and taking a gun by seeing a coming vehicle, either show this. Then, something else happens. The husband introduces himself to the vehicle driver - the doctor- and the viewers figure out that he is the head of the committee. This causes the viewers to forget their previous conclusions and think that the main reason of the wife's reactions is hearing her husband's name. While thinking about this, the dialogs between the couple return the viewers back to the first conclusion. The movie keeps the viewers in a reciprocating situation, which continues along the story. The husband thinks he knows everything about his wife's prison but figures out it was not. The wife gains new information about a sexual relation between his husband and another girl during her prison time and the viewers us not sure about the guilt of the doctor. This uncertainty is smartly placed in the script. In the other side, the battery radio used to show the importance of the news in the beginning of the film, was utilized again in the middle to prove the crime of the doctor without any encounter to went off electricity and plays the "Death and the Maiden" piece to show the title of the film.

    (Though this doesn't contain all surprises or, ah hem, spoilers, it does borderline it. #1 just watch the movie  it is a near-masterpiece, a near perfect suspense thriller/mystery everyone (of age) should see. #2 then read my review. It's very hard to write about it without giving away too much.) It was more of a crime that Weaver was neither nominated nor won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1994 than the crimes committed against her in the movie, Death and the Maiden. Okay, that's taking it a bit far; what happened to her character was unmistakably HORRIBLE, but she still should've won something for her fantastic post-victim performance. And it was a further crime hardly anyone saw this near-masterpiece of a small/indie film that screams stage play. In fact, when I first saw this many years ago, aside from being immediately enthralled in the story and acting of Weaver, my first reaction was this was meant for the stage  and this was before I did find out, in fact, it was previously a theatre production. What we have here, in one of my all-time favorite movies, is paranoid Paulina (Weaver) living in isolation with her lawyer-husband, Gerardo (Wilson) in a South American now-"supposedly" free country. Gerardo had a flat, was late for dinner and Paulina's p|ssed..but it's not clear up front on why. Slowly, but absolutely surelythe pieces fall into place, ever so deliberately on why she's both paranoid and p|ssed. But as bad of a life she makes you believe she hasthe past is about to make things a little worst. Gerardo had a Good Samaritan for his flat tire in the form of Dr. Miranda (Kingsley) and upon the doctor's admiration for the lawyer who's about to work for the President on anti-torture criminals  and a few drinks  Paulina's senses go into overdrive. She is absolutely sure the voice and even smell from the other room where she's "pretending to be sleeping" that the good ole doc was her captive from awhile back. I really don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say, she was kidnapped prior to the movie started and Pauline believes this stranger was (one of) her torturer(s). Eventually, she's going to make him prove he did it, or his innocence. One way or another. Literally, I am going to stop here. I've given away only 5% of the movie, and I feel that's too much. This movie, with literally only three actors, plays out in deep mystery and suspense and you will feel every bit of the pain Weaver wants you to. She is an astonishing actress and proves it here. You would need to be in a 3-person movie. The other two, Kingsley and Wilson, were also good, but this is Weaver's show. Her and her character's redemption or potential healing. It won't take too much of your time  it's relatively short, but it will be worth seeing this wonderful movie and you will see past Ripley (Alien). (Actually, a little too much, at times. Boy, Weaver wanted to get naked for this movie)

    Films like this generally are problematic. They are written as plays and kept as plays when carried over, so the filmmaker is limited to a preset notion of the space. "Rope" was taken as a challenge in this regard, with a master visionary exploiting the confinement. It was, in effect, a learning experience for him without much reward for us, beyond what the play itself carried. Here in this film, we have something similar I believe. Polanski is a rare talent, a filmmaker that understands confinement  indeed his whole life is defined by the concept. He was approached to direct-for-hire and took the job, I believe, because he wanted a similar learning experience. So what we have here is a screenplay that was frozen before the man started his film and which he has taken unaltered. Someone else selected the actors, making what I think were bad choices. On this, Polanski designed the eye, making what I see as a whole different movie on top of the play. The play is about a woman who had been victimized by state torture. She believes she has encountered her torturer; the film is about the encounter and the extent to which you can trust her narrative or the accused. Her husband presides; he is literally a lawyer selected by the new president to sort out just these sorts of conflicting truths. The question is: will the accused confess? Well he does before the film is over, but was his confession true? Neither one of these two gives us much reason to trust them as characters. They both are liars. What Polanski does is subtly more the stance of the camera so that we alternate between who is the narrator so far as the lines compared to who is the aligned watcher and whose narrative space is tentatively trusted. It is a remarkable exercise, of just the kind that he would devour. I believe he used these skills in a similar weave of untrusted narrative in his next film, "Gate," which I think is an unappreciated masterpiece. But unless you happen to be tuned into this movie on a movie, this narrative about narrative, you will find this a pretty tame encounter. Unless you happen to live in a country that sponsors torture. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    A woman seeks revenge from a man she recognizes as a government official who tortured and raped her years ago for her political views. Based on a play, the setting could have been post-WWII Germany with a Jewish woman going against her Nazi persecutor. However, it is set in an unnamed South American country. There are only three characters and most of the action takes place on a single set, but Polanski manages to sustain the tension throughout. Weaver is convincing as the vengeful woman. Wilson and Kingsley are fine as her husband and the man she accuses of war crimes, respectively. The title comes from Schubert's 14th string quartet, which was played every time Weaver was raped.

    We hear about it all the time; people have been harmed in the most unspeakable ways, causing pain that most of us cannot begin to even imagine. If this happened to you, what would you do if the person who hurt you walked into your house? This kind of moral quagmire has been approached before in films. Many times, in fact. The torture angle is new though. Unfortunately, that's all that's new about this story. But this is the situation that one woman, Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), an ex-activist who was horrifically tortured in order to give up the name of a fellow activist (who later became her husband), finds herself in, when a man (Ben Kingsley) is invited into their home after helping her husband (Stuart Wilson). She is convinced that this man, Dr. Miranda, is the one who brutalized her. He denies it, of course. And her husband, now a high-powered lawyer, is caught in the middle. This film could have gone in two opposite directions: a high-powered, claustrophobic thriller or a leadened message movie. Fortunately, it's not the latter (no one is going to mistake this movie for a UNICEF infomercial), but sadly, it's not the former either. It's somewhere in the middle. There are moments of where it works, but overall it's pretty boring. Part of the reason is that the most important part is miscast. Sigourney Weaver is a good actress, but she's not right for this role. She has moments of effectiveness (Weaver is good at being vulnerable), but when she tries to act menacing, she's awful. Ben Kingsley is terrific, though, as the may-or-may not be torturer. He keeps us on our toes, and we never know whether or not he's innocent. Noted character actor Stuart Wilson is actually able to keep up with the Oscar-winner and Oscar-nominee. The problem isn't necessarily with Roman Polanski's approach. "Death and the Maiden" is heavy on the atmosphere, although it could have used some more claustrophobia to increase the tension. The problem is that the script, based on the play, is rather bland. There's nothing that really draws us into the story, and it doesn't take any risks. Thus what could have been a powerful and provocative drama or thriller (take your pick) becomes inert. It's not a total waste; the film effectively keeps us guessing who's telling the truth. But the suspense isn't there, even though it has plenty of opportunity to build. However, the ending of the film is horrible. What happens not only doesn't make sense, it's actually more than slightly reprehensible. This isn't a bad film, just a wasted opportunity.

    This is one of the cinematic homes for this filmmaker. He swims comfortably in these waters. Polanski requires very little elements to induce great tension in any film. That's why he has looked for scripts like this, often in his career. This is a great thing, the ability to take very few scenery elements, in this case a single very small house, and the surrounding landscape, and build the narrative over that. Because that's what we have. The story is simple enough to produce no distractions, and the landscape is wide and desert enough to do the same. What we have is a whole set up that surrounds an idea of uncertain truth, provisional reality (to our eyes). That's why we never stop wondering whether Weaver is right or wrong, whether Kingsley is a rapist or a victim. So does Stuart Wilson, who goes through the same range of doubt as we, spectators, go, and that makes him our surrogate in the film. We are judges to our own sentence. All the cruelty of an invented regime of a supposed south American country is the mere formalization of the credibility of the world. It is not about denouncing crimes nor about discussing politics, as it has been said. Also, much has been said about how much the final monologue reveals the truth, i say it keeps all the possibilities opened, though it suggests sincerity. As an idea, this is as simple as it gets, and as every simple idea, it's so hard to achieve, keeping it simple. That's where things get interesting, when you check the cinematic devices that surround and collaborate with the simplicity of a simple doubt that this theatrical script suggests. First we have the core of the story framed, at beginning and end, by the core music, a quartet which names the film, and gives consistency to the drama of Sigourney's character. We have the handling of the wide open landscape, with its lighthouse. The sense of green isolation, the poetics of the location, which growths on us, as it is given in small bits, until becoming the final stage to the real drama. The house. This part matters, as this a film by a director who really knows how to handle space and include it in the drama. This is worth for a hotel room, a boat, or a small house. This is what he has been making throughout his life, in "knife in the water", his apartment trilogy, bitter moon and this one. It is something i admire, the ability to include the space that surrounds the characters into their dramas and discussions. That's one way, one of deepest ways to include (architectural) space in the fields of cinema. Orson Welles, Hitchcock (sometimes), Polanski... they all trust on their own camera. We have the acting at the center of the success of this film. Everyone of the 3 actors involved play at their top here, each one knows where he stands, and interprets perfectly what is required of him to make things flow. Ambiguity, to Ben Kinsgley, Messed up mind to Sigourney Weaver, Reactiveness and indecision to Stuart Wilson. This is less achieved than other efforts, but Roman never ceases to deliver his special gaze, and that's always worth seeing. My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com
