 <sinopse>
  Extreme measures are necessary to contain an epidemic of a deadly airborne virus. But how extreme, exactly?
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In July of 1967, In Motaba River Valley, Zaire, a virus with a 100% mortality rate starts infecting people. The virus becomes known as the Motaba virus, and it's so deadly that it causes severe bleeding and liquefies internal organs, killing within 3 days. The virus wipes out Motaba River Valley, and a devastatingly huge fire bomb is dropped onto Motaba River Valley in order to reduce the chances of further infection. The bomb was dropped on the orders of corrupt General Donald McClintock, even though an army surgeon, General Bill Ford, was against the idea. 27 years later, in 1994, there is another outbreak in Motaba River Valley. At the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), located at Fort Detrick in Maryland, Colonel Sam Daniels is doing research on the Motaba virus, and so is his ex-wife Roberta Keough, who works at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. A monkey carrying the Motaba virus stows away on a ...

    While 'Outbreak' is a thoroughly entertaining film, there are too many holes in the plot for the film to be completely convincing. While the acting is good from all concerned parties, one gets the sense that the director, Wolfgang Petersen added too many unnecessary scenes to the film in an attempt to satisfy a wider audience. The first half of the film is excellent and the film develops at a rapid pace leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering how this very promising film is going to play out. However, the second half is disappointing as the film relies on predictable and superficial ways of pleasing the viewer, like the helicopter chase and the catching of the monkey. After watching the film, I thought it was good but it could have been a lot better had the director in the second half of the film focused more on the panic and terror that is created by the virus and how this fear manifests itself with the people. Instead we get a formulaic aerial chase, the good guy versus bad guy scenario and one wonders why when the film didn't really need this as the film has enough substance to carry it without these cheap devices.

    This film was gripping from start to finish and is lead by an all star cast including Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman (to name a few). The film basically is about a deadly virus that initially plagues California and then spreads to other areas of America and Dustin Hoffman and his team of Army personnel have to determine who or what is causing it. This film packs a perfect blend of drama, humour and tension so it does have a bit of something for everyone. What elevates this film is its strong script, excellent acting (particularly Dustin Hoffman who has already proved himself to be a brilliant actor after his Oscar winning performance in Rain Man- a personal favourite film of mine which is definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it). Another of the film's strengths is the interaction between the characters (the dialogue was great and never became dull) and I personally thought Hoffman and Spacey worked well together in this film. The only scene which didn't really ring true was the scene at the house in California where Hoffman and Gooding Jr send the little girl outside to coax the monkey out of the woods so that they could shoot it. What I couldn't understand is that they sent her outside with no protective clothing and no face mask (knowing or 'being pretty certain' that this monkey was the 'Host' which contains the virus). That seemed unrealistic to me. To sum up, Outbreak is an underrated film which deserves a much wider audience. This is an excellent thriller which is well worth your time. Enjoy!

    This is a very good example of a very right combination of very right ingredients - great actors (Russo, Hoffman, Freeman, Sutherland, Gooding, Spacey), great scenery, excellent plot, strong effects, correct amount of suspense, decent idea behind, and very good music (big thumbs to James Newton-Howard). This is a very captivating movie, not without goofs or weaker moments, but it is made very professionally and very endearingly. The 2 hours are long usually, but not here - they fly fast I do recommend this good movie. Of course, we must realize this was never attempted to be a masterpiece, but this is a very decent example of a suspense medical catastrophe movie and it does not have all the unnecessary pathetic speeches or shallow characters. The balance is measured well and healthily

    I chose to rent this on the basis of its very strong cast. Headed by Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman (who also do well) the movie also included names like Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Donald Sutherland. With names like that I had to assume at the very least that the performances would be strong. For the most part they were, although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock - which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine. The story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston, but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek, California. The disease is obviously a threat, and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels - an Army doctor trying to figure this out; Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford. When the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease, this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released "Contagion." The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening, but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. "Outbreak" avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in "Contagion." The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government. Where "Outbreak" fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller (basically the last 30-40 minutes) which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase. That was well done, but it went on far too long and after a while I just wanted to get on with the story. It's a big problem when you find the last half hour of a movie to be rather dull. And yet, up to that point it was doing a pretty good job with its basic story, and, frankly, I enjoyed watching this more than I enjoyed watching "Contagion." (6/10)

    I watched this movie last night and I liked it but I wish they had done more with it. They took it small and kind of happy which is not what this topic should be about in my opinion. However the cast is great including stars like Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman. This movie is about a doctor in the military who is supposed to control deadly diseases. A new deadly disease appears in Africa and he is sent to find out what it is. However a monkey has been sent to America that carries the disease. After infecting one guy the disease starts to spread like crazy killing anyone who gets infected. The doctor and his team are sent to cure it but he will soon find out that some people don't want that cure made and they will do anything to prevent its creation. This movie was a decent watch like I said though I think they should have done the movie on a larger scale.

    Every seemingly conceivable means of getting infected by a killer virus is explored and shown in detail - from sneezing in a movie theatre to having a tiny cut in a lab suit to having water spat on you by a monkey. This monkey (don't ask me what sort - I don't like them!) is captured in Africa to be sold for breeding in the U.S. But it carries a new strain of a virus, one that had been identified thirty years earlier. This being a nice little actioner, everything that can go wrong, does. "Only in the Movies" is a very apt description - or is it? We've had the scare of bird flu since and if you let yourself think too much, well, don't! There's quite a cast - Dustin Hoffman, who is/was married to Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman and Cuba Gooding Jnr. Oh, and Donald Sutherland crops up creepily as a military chief with a nasty streak. Unfortunately, Hoffman never looks as though he was ever married to Russo - they just look and sound poles apart, though after splitting up semi amicably at the start, inevitably (of course!) they end up working together against the clock and against the military, who have their own, more 'complete' ideas on how to contain the virus. It's all very watchable and director Wolfgang Peterson keeps things moving along nicely and with enough little details, some a little far- fetched, to keep up the tension. All in all, it's a neat way of packaging a medical and environmental action piece into an older family's movie and can be enjoyed by all except young children (there's some swearing). Oh - and there's some great looking make-up, which makes a lot of people look very unwell indeed!

    For years I avoided this film like well the plague. My inner critic informed me that it was just more Hollywood pap purpose built for the guileless and those less discerning. I should listen to my inner critic more Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), Casey (Kevin Spacey) and Saul (Cuba Gooding Jr) are a team of highly trained (and Oscar winning) army scientists. When they identify that an extremely lethal and highly contagious virus known as the Motaba strain has somehow made it to the continental United States they immediately relay news of the threat up the line of management. Only it seems that for some reason the powers that be  among whose numbers are Billy (Morgan Freeman) and McClintock (Donald Sutherland)  ain't listening, despite all the evidence, scientific graphs, diagrams and powerpoint charts that practically demand to the audience that they should. By the way all of the above have perfectly legitimate army ranks, but in a film this silly I like to refer to them as Sam, Billy and co Sam thinks that this new virus is reeeeeelllll bad, he tells his ex Robbie (Rene Russo), who is now a civilian scientist. Robbie initially ignores him just as Billy did, but when some gooey, pus-filled evidence oozes his way into her view she becomes more sympathetic to his claims, yet even with the mounting body count Billy and his superiors stubbornly dig in their heels, place their fingers in their ears and sing "la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaa" to drown out the facts  even when a small town in *gasp* heartland America becomes threatened by mass contagion. Sam, Saul and Casey show up and start dispensing with both assistance and claims that things will only get worse to anyone who will listen  which appears to be no-one. Billy arrives on the scene to demand no more talk about this bizarre cover-up, and a cast of mostly good (and in many cases award winning) actors wallow in this mediocrity for another 90 minutes of ennui. As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states. As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said "Show me the monkey!" I wouldn't have been surprised. Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich&eacute;d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting. I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot' Final Rating  4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie.

    When a disease in Africa is found , extreme measures are necessary to stop a rapacious epidemic , as dinky Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is sent to discover it . When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that's somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . Suspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood's usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with &uml;The Neverending story&uml; and &uml;Das Boot&uml; ,after that , he emigrated US where realized &uml;Night of shattered crystals&uml;, &uml;Enemy mine&uml; , and the successful &uml;Air Force one&uml;and &uml;The patriot&uml; , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake &uml;Poseidon&uml;. Rating : well worth watching , better than average .

    The Motaba virus in Outbreak is a particularly nasty agentfar more virulent than Ebolawhich arrives in the US via a cheeky little monkey illegally imported from Zaire. As the disease makes itself known, rapidly infecting a small Californian township, army scientist Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) and his crew must try to find a cure before despicable general McClintock (Donald Sutherland) carries out his plan to firebomb the area and its inhabitants. Being something of a germaphobe, I find Outbreak to be a genuinely scary movie, depicting the horrific scenario of a deadly viral epidemic hitting small-town America; the mere idea of microscopic bugs that can enter the body unseen and liquefy the internal organs really gets under my skin (pun intended), and if such a virus did hit the civilised Western world, I don't fancy the chances of Cuba Gooding Jr. cooking up a batch of anti-virus in time to save our collective ass. Extreme liberties are taken with medical facts and the film is pretty implausible at times, with a traditionally sappy happy Hollywood ending, but it still manages to be hugely entertaining nonsense: Director Wolfgang Petersen effectively feeds on his audience's paranoia, depicting 'Joe Public' succumbing to the illness in the the most innocuous of places, most notably in a movie theatre (a scene that really made me want to cover my mouth when I saw it on the big screen); he also shoehorns in a cool conspiracy subplota government cover-upmaking this perfect fodder for those with overactive imaginations. The film also packs in some big-budget blockbuster thrills, including a spectacular helicopter chase scene followed by a tense mid-air final&eacute;, and even manages a few lighthearted moments amidst all the misery and death. It would be easy to berate Outbreak for being formulaic mainstream tosh, and many have, but if you can put logic on hold for a while it can be a whole lot of fun. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

We've had the scare of bird flu since and if you let yourself think too much, well, don't! There's quite a cast - Dustin Hoffman, who is/was married to Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman and Cuba Gooding Jnr. Oh, and Donald Sutherland crops up creepily as a military chief with a nasty streak. Unfortunately, Hoffman never looks as though he was ever married to Russo - they just look and sound poles apart, though after splitting up semi amicably at the start, inevitably (of course!) they end up working together against the clock and against the military, who have their own, more 'complete' ideas on how to contain the virus. It's all very watchable and director Wolfgang Peterson keeps things moving along nicely and with enough little details, some a little far- fetched, to keep up the tension. All in all, it's a neat way of packaging a medical and environmental action piece into an older family's movie and can be enjoyed by all except young children (there's some swearing). Oh - and there's some great looking make-up, which makes a lot of people look very unwell indeed!

    For years I avoided this film like well the plague. My inner critic informed me that it was just more Hollywood pap purpose built for the guileless and those less discerning. I should listen to my inner critic more Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), Casey (Kevin Spacey) and Saul (Cuba Gooding Jr) are a team of highly trained (and Oscar winning) army scientists. When they identify that an extremely lethal and highly contagious virus known as the Motaba strain has somehow made it to the continental United States they immediately relay news of the threat up the line of management. Only it seems that for some reason the powers that be  among whose numbers are Billy (Morgan Freeman) and McClintock (Donald Sutherland)  ain't listening, despite all the evidence, scientific graphs, diagrams and powerpoint charts that practically demand to the audience that they should. By the way all of the above have perfectly legitimate army ranks, but in a film this silly I like to refer to them as Sam, Billy and co Sam thinks that this new virus is reeeeeelllll bad, he tells his ex Robbie (Rene Russo), who is now a civilian scientist. Robbie initially ignores him just as Billy did, but when some gooey, pus-filled evidence oozes his way into her view she becomes more sympathetic to his claims, yet even with the mounting body count Billy and his superiors stubbornly dig in their heels, place their fingers in their ears and sing "la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaa" to drown out the facts  even when a small town in *gasp* heartland America becomes threatened by mass contagion. Sam, Saul and Casey show up and start dispensing with both assistance and claims that things will only get worse to anyone who will listen  which appears to be no-one. Billy arrives on the scene to demand no more talk about this bizarre cover-up, and a cast of mostly good (and in many cases award winning) actors wallow in this mediocrity for another 90 minutes of ennui. As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states. As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said "Show me the monkey!" I wouldn't have been surprised. Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich&eacute;d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting. I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot' Final Rating  4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie.

    When a disease in Africa is found , extreme measures are necessary to stop a rapacious epidemic , as dinky Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is sent to discover it . When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that's somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . Suspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood's usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with &uml;The Neverending story&uml; and &uml;Das Boot&uml; ,after that , he emigrated US where realized &uml;Night of shattered crystals&uml;, &uml;Enemy mine&uml; , and the successful &uml;Air Force one&uml;and &uml;The patriot&uml; , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake &uml;Poseidon&uml;. Rating : well worth watching , better than average .

    The Motaba virus in Outbreak is a particularly nasty agentfar more virulent than Ebolawhich arrives in the US via a cheeky little monkey illegally imported from Zaire. As the disease makes itself known, rapidly infecting a small Californian township, army scientist Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) and his crew must try to find a cure before despicable general McClintock (Donald Sutherland) carries out his plan to firebomb the area and its inhabitants. Being something of a germaphobe, I find Outbreak to be a genuinely scary movie, depicting the horrific scenario of a deadly viral epidemic hitting small-town America; the mere idea of microscopic bugs that can enter the body unseen and liquefy the internal organs really gets under my skin (pun intended), and if such a virus did hit the civilised Western world, I don't fancy the chances of Cuba Gooding Jr. cooking up a batch of anti-virus in time to save our collective ass. Extreme liberties are taken with medical facts and the film is pretty implausible at times, with a traditionally sappy happy Hollywood ending, but it still manages to be hugely entertaining nonsense: Director Wolfgang Petersen effectively feeds on his audience's paranoia, depicting 'Joe Public' succumbing to the illness in the the most innocuous of places, most notably in a movie theatre (a scene that really made me want to cover my mouth when I saw it on the big screen); he also shoehorns in a cool conspiracy subplota government cover-upmaking this perfect fodder for those with overactive imaginations. The film also packs in some big-budget blockbuster thrills, including a spectacular helicopter chase scene followed by a tense mid-air final&eacute;, and even manages a few lighthearted moments amidst all the misery and death. It would be easy to berate Outbreak for being formulaic mainstream tosh, and many have, but if you can put logic on hold for a while it can be a whole lot of fun. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    While 'Outbreak' is a thoroughly entertaining film, there are too many holes in the plot for the film to be completely convincing. While the acting is good from all concerned parties, one gets the sense that the director, Wolfgang Petersen added too many unnecessary scenes to the film in an attempt to satisfy a wider audience. The first half of the film is excellent and the film develops at a rapid pace leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering how this very promising film is going to play out. However, the second half is disappointing as the film relies on predictable and superficial ways of pleasing the viewer, like the helicopter chase and the catching of the monkey. After watching the film, I thought it was good but it could have been a lot better had the director in the second half of the film focused more on the panic and terror that is created by the virus and how this fear manifests itself with the people. Instead we get a formulaic aerial chase, the good guy versus bad guy scenario and one wonders why when the film didn't really need this as the film has enough substance to carry it without these cheap devices.

    This film was gripping from start to finish and is lead by an all star cast including Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman (to name a few). The film basically is about a deadly virus that initially plagues California and then spreads to other areas of America and Dustin Hoffman and his team of Army personnel have to determine who or what is causing it. This film packs a perfect blend of drama, humour and tension so it does have a bit of something for everyone. What elevates this film is its strong script, excellent acting (particularly Dustin Hoffman who has already proved himself to be a brilliant actor after his Oscar winning performance in Rain Man- a personal favourite film of mine which is definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it). Another of the film's strengths is the interaction between the characters (the dialogue was great and never became dull) and I personally thought Hoffman and Spacey worked well together in this film. The only scene which didn't really ring true was the scene at the house in California where Hoffman and Gooding Jr send the little girl outside to coax the monkey out of the woods so that they could shoot it. What I couldn't understand is that they sent her outside with no protective clothing and no face mask (knowing or 'being pretty certain' that this monkey was the 'Host' which contains the virus). That seemed unrealistic to me. To sum up, Outbreak is an underrated film which deserves a much wider audience. This is an excellent thriller which is well worth your time. Enjoy!

    This is a very good example of a very right combination of very right ingredients - great actors (Russo, Hoffman, Freeman, Sutherland, Gooding, Spacey), great scenery, excellent plot, strong effects, correct amount of suspense, decent idea behind, and very good music (big thumbs to James Newton-Howard). This is a very captivating movie, not without goofs or weaker moments, but it is made very professionally and very endearingly. The 2 hours are long usually, but not here - they fly fast I do recommend this good movie. Of course, we must realize this was never attempted to be a masterpiece, but this is a very decent example of a suspense medical catastrophe movie and it does not have all the unnecessary pathetic speeches or shallow characters. The balance is measured well and healthily

    I chose to rent this on the basis of its very strong cast. Headed by Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman (who also do well) the movie also included names like Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Donald Sutherland. With names like that I had to assume at the very least that the performances would be strong. For the most part they were, although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock - which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine. The story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston, but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek, California. The disease is obviously a threat, and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels - an Army doctor trying to figure this out; Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford. When the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease, this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released "Contagion." The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening, but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. "Outbreak" avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in "Contagion." The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government. Where "Outbreak" fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller (basically the last 30-40 minutes) which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase. That was well done, but it went on far too long and after a while I just wanted to get on with the story. It's a big problem when you find the last half hour of a movie to be rather dull. And yet, up to that point it was doing a pretty good job with its basic story, and, frankly, I enjoyed watching this more than I enjoyed watching "Contagion." (6/10)

    I watched this movie last night and I liked it but I wish they had done more with it. They took it small and kind of happy which is not what this topic should be about in my opinion. However the cast is great including stars like Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman. This movie is about a doctor in the military who is supposed to control deadly diseases. A new deadly disease appears in Africa and he is sent to find out what it is. However a monkey has been sent to America that carries the disease. After infecting one guy the disease starts to spread like crazy killing anyone who gets infected. The doctor and his team are sent to cure it but he will soon find out that some people don't want that cure made and they will do anything to prevent its creation. This movie was a decent watch like I said though I think they should have done the movie on a larger scale.

    Every seemingly conceivable means of getting infected by a killer virus is explored and shown in detail - from sneezing in a movie theatre to having a tiny cut in a lab suit to having water spat on you by a monkey. This monkey (don't ask me what sort - I don't like them!) is captured in Africa to be sold for breeding in the U.S. But it carries a new strain of a virus, one that had been identified thirty years earlier. This being a nice little actioner, everything that can go wrong, does. "Only in the Movies" is a very apt description - or is it?

It's all very watchable and director Wolfgang Peterson keeps things moving along nicely and with enough little details, some a little far- fetched, to keep up the tension. All in all, it's a neat way of packaging a medical and environmental action piece into an older family's movie and can be enjoyed by all except young children (there's some swearing). Oh - and there's some great looking make-up, which makes a lot of people look very unwell indeed!

What elevates this film is its strong script, excellent acting (particularly Dustin Hoffman who has already proved himself to be a brilliant actor after his Oscar winning performance in Rain Man- a personal favourite film of mine which is definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it). Another of the film's strengths is the interaction between the characters (the dialogue was great and never became dull) and I personally thought Hoffman and Spacey worked well together in this film. The only scene which didn't really ring true was the scene at the house in California where Hoffman and Gooding Jr send the little girl outside to coax the monkey out of the woods so that they could shoot it. What I couldn't understand is that they sent her outside with no protective clothing and no face mask (knowing or 'being pretty certain' that this monkey was the 'Host' which contains the virus). That seemed unrealistic to me. To sum up, Outbreak is an underrated film which deserves a much wider audience. This is an excellent thriller which is well worth your time. Enjoy!

    This is a very good example of a very right combination of very right ingredients - great actors (Russo, Hoffman, Freeman, Sutherland, Gooding, Spacey), great scenery, excellent plot, strong effects, correct amount of suspense, decent idea behind, and very good music (big thumbs to James Newton-Howard). This is a very captivating movie, not without goofs or weaker moments, but it is made very professionally and very endearingly. The 2 hours are long usually, but not here - they fly fast I do recommend this good movie. Of course, we must realize this was never attempted to be a masterpiece, but this is a very decent example of a suspense medical catastrophe movie and it does not have all the unnecessary pathetic speeches or shallow characters. The balance is measured well and healthily

    I chose to rent this on the basis of its very strong cast. Headed by Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman (who also do well) the movie also included names like Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Donald Sutherland. With names like that I had to assume at the very least that the performances would be strong. For the most part they were, although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock - which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine. The story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston, but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek, California. The disease is obviously a threat, and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels - an Army doctor trying to figure this out; Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford. When the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease, this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released "Contagion." The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening, but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. "Outbreak" avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in "Contagion." The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government. Where "Outbreak" fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller (basically the last 30-40 minutes) which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase. That was well done, but it went on far too long and after a while I just wanted to get on with the story. It's a big problem when you find the last half hour of a movie to be rather dull. And yet, up to that point it was doing a pretty good job with its basic story, and, frankly, I enjoyed watching this more than I enjoyed watching "Contagion." (6/10)

    I watched this movie last night and I liked it but I wish they had done more with it. They took it small and kind of happy which is not what this topic should be about in my opinion. However the cast is great including stars like Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman. This movie is about a doctor in the military who is supposed to control deadly diseases. A new deadly disease appears in Africa and he is sent to find out what it is. However a monkey has been sent to America that carries the disease. After infecting one guy the disease starts to spread like crazy killing anyone who gets infected. The doctor and his team are sent to cure it but he will soon find out that some people don't want that cure made and they will do anything to prevent its creation. This movie was a decent watch like I said though I think they should have done the movie on a larger scale.

    Every seemingly conceivable means of getting infected by a killer virus is explored and shown in detail - from sneezing in a movie theatre to having a tiny cut in a lab suit to having water spat on you by a monkey. This monkey (don't ask me what sort - I don't like them!) is captured in Africa to be sold for breeding in the U.S. But it carries a new strain of a virus, one that had been identified thirty years earlier. This being a nice little actioner, everything that can go wrong, does. "Only in the Movies" is a very apt description - or is it? We've had the scare of bird flu since and if you let yourself think too much, well, don't! There's quite a cast - Dustin Hoffman, who is/was married to Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman and Cuba Gooding Jnr. Oh, and Donald Sutherland crops up creepily as a military chief with a nasty streak. Unfortunately, Hoffman never looks as though he was ever married to Russo - they just look and sound poles apart, though after splitting up semi amicably at the start, inevitably (of course!) they end up working together against the clock and against the military, who have their own, more 'complete' ideas on how to contain the virus. It's all very watchable and director Wolfgang Peterson keeps things moving along nicely and with enough little details, some a little far- fetched, to keep up the tension. All in all, it's a neat way of packaging a medical and environmental action piece into an older family's movie and can be enjoyed by all except young children (there's some swearing). Oh - and there's some great looking make-up, which makes a lot of people look very unwell indeed!

    For years I avoided this film like well the plague. My inner critic informed me that it was just more Hollywood pap purpose built for the guileless and those less discerning. I should listen to my inner critic more Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), Casey (Kevin Spacey) and Saul (Cuba Gooding Jr) are a team of highly trained (and Oscar winning) army scientists. When they identify that an extremely lethal and highly contagious virus known as the Motaba strain has somehow made it to the continental United States they immediately relay news of the threat up the line of management. Only it seems that for some reason the powers that be  among whose numbers are Billy (Morgan Freeman) and McClintock (Donald Sutherland)  ain't listening, despite all the evidence, scientific graphs, diagrams and powerpoint charts that practically demand to the audience that they should. By the way all of the above have perfectly legitimate army ranks, but in a film this silly I like to refer to them as Sam, Billy and co Sam thinks that this new virus is reeeeeelllll bad, he tells his ex Robbie (Rene Russo), who is now a civilian scientist. Robbie initially ignores him just as Billy did, but when some gooey, pus-filled evidence oozes his way into her view she becomes more sympathetic to his claims, yet even with the mounting body count Billy and his superiors stubbornly dig in their heels, place their fingers in their ears and sing "la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaa" to drown out the facts  even when a small town in *gasp* heartland America becomes threatened by mass contagion. Sam, Saul and Casey show up and start dispensing with both assistance and claims that things will only get worse to anyone who will listen  which appears to be no-one. Billy arrives on the scene to demand no more talk about this bizarre cover-up, and a cast of mostly good (and in many cases award winning) actors wallow in this mediocrity for another 90 minutes of ennui. As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states. As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said "Show me the monkey!" I wouldn't have been surprised. Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich&eacute;d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting. I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot' Final Rating  4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie.

    When a disease in Africa is found , extreme measures are necessary to stop a rapacious epidemic , as dinky Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is sent to discover it . When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that's somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . Suspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood's usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with &uml;The Neverending story&uml; and &uml;Das Boot&uml; ,after that , he emigrated US where realized &uml;Night of shattered crystals&uml;, &uml;Enemy mine&uml; , and the successful &uml;Air Force one&uml;and &uml;The patriot&uml; , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake &uml;Poseidon&uml;. Rating : well worth watching , better than average .

    The Motaba virus in Outbreak is a particularly nasty agentfar more virulent than Ebolawhich arrives in the US via a cheeky little monkey illegally imported from Zaire. As the disease makes itself known, rapidly infecting a small Californian township, army scientist Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) and his crew must try to find a cure before despicable general McClintock (Donald Sutherland) carries out his plan to firebomb the area and its inhabitants. Being something of a germaphobe, I find Outbreak to be a genuinely scary movie, depicting the horrific scenario of a deadly viral epidemic hitting small-town America; the mere idea of microscopic bugs that can enter the body unseen and liquefy the internal organs really gets under my skin (pun intended), and if such a virus did hit the civilised Western world, I don't fancy the chances of Cuba Gooding Jr. cooking up a batch of anti-virus in time to save our collective ass. Extreme liberties are taken with medical facts and the film is pretty implausible at times, with a traditionally sappy happy Hollywood ending, but it still manages to be hugely entertaining nonsense: Director Wolfgang Petersen effectively feeds on his audience's paranoia, depicting 'Joe Public' succumbing to the illness in the the most innocuous of places, most notably in a movie theatre (a scene that really made me want to cover my mouth when I saw it on the big screen); he also shoehorns in a cool conspiracy subplota government cover-upmaking this perfect fodder for those with overactive imaginations. The film also packs in some big-budget blockbuster thrills, including a spectacular helicopter chase scene followed by a tense mid-air final&eacute;, and even manages a few lighthearted moments amidst all the misery and death. It would be easy to berate Outbreak for being formulaic mainstream tosh, and many have, but if you can put logic on hold for a while it can be a whole lot of fun. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    While 'Outbreak' is a thoroughly entertaining film, there are too many holes in the plot for the film to be completely convincing. While the acting is good from all concerned parties, one gets the sense that the director, Wolfgang Petersen added too many unnecessary scenes to the film in an attempt to satisfy a wider audience. The first half of the film is excellent and the film develops at a rapid pace leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering how this very promising film is going to play out. However, the second half is disappointing as the film relies on predictable and superficial ways of pleasing the viewer, like the helicopter chase and the catching of the monkey. After watching the film, I thought it was good but it could have been a lot better had the director in the second half of the film focused more on the panic and terror that is created by the virus and how this fear manifests itself with the people. Instead we get a formulaic aerial chase, the good guy versus bad guy scenario and one wonders why when the film didn't really need this as the film has enough substance to carry it without these cheap devices.

    This film was gripping from start to finish and is lead by an all star cast including Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman (to name a few). The film basically is about a deadly virus that initially plagues California and then spreads to other areas of America and Dustin Hoffman and his team of Army personnel have to determine who or what is causing it. This film packs a perfect blend of drama, humour and tension so it does have a bit of something for everyone. What elevates this film is its strong script, excellent acting (particularly Dustin Hoffman who has already proved himself to be a brilliant actor after his Oscar winning performance in Rain Man- a personal favourite film of mine which is definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it). Another of the film's strengths is the interaction between the characters (the dialogue was great and never became dull) and I personally thought Hoffman and Spacey worked well together in this film. The only scene which didn't really ring true was the scene at the house in California where Hoffman and Gooding Jr send the little girl outside to coax the monkey out of the woods so that they could shoot it. What I couldn't understand is that they sent her outside with no protective clothing and no face mask (knowing or 'being pretty certain' that this monkey was the 'Host' which contains the virus). That seemed unrealistic to me. To sum up, Outbreak is an underrated film which deserves a much wider audience. This is an excellent thriller which is well worth your time. Enjoy!

    When a disease in Africa is found , extreme measures are necessary to stop a rapacious epidemic , as dinky Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is sent to discover it . When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that's somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . Suspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood's usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with &uml;The Neverending story&uml; and &uml;Das Boot&uml; ,after that , he emigrated US where realized &uml;Night of shattered crystals&uml;, &uml;Enemy mine&uml; , and the successful &uml;Air Force one&uml;and &uml;The patriot&uml; , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake &uml;Poseidon&uml;.

    The Motaba virus in Outbreak is a particularly nasty agentfar more virulent than Ebolawhich arrives in the US via a cheeky little monkey illegally imported from Zaire. As the disease makes itself known, rapidly infecting a small Californian township, army scientist Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) and his crew must try to find a cure before despicable general McClintock (Donald Sutherland) carries out his plan to firebomb the area and its inhabitants. Being something of a germaphobe, I find Outbreak to be a genuinely scary movie, depicting the horrific scenario of a deadly viral epidemic hitting small-town America; the mere idea of microscopic bugs that can enter the body unseen and liquefy the internal organs really gets under my skin (pun intended), and if such a virus did hit the civilised Western world, I don't fancy the chances of Cuba Gooding Jr. cooking up a batch of anti-virus in time to save our collective ass. Extreme liberties are taken with medical facts and the film is pretty implausible at times, with a traditionally sappy happy Hollywood ending, but it still manages to be hugely entertaining nonsense: Director Wolfgang Petersen effectively feeds on his audience's paranoia, depicting 'Joe Public' succumbing to the illness in the the most innocuous of places, most notably in a movie theatre (a scene that really made me want to cover my mouth when I saw it on the big screen); he also shoehorns in a cool conspiracy subplota government cover-upmaking this perfect fodder for those with overactive imaginations. The film also packs in some big-budget blockbuster thrills, including a spectacular helicopter chase scene followed by a tense mid-air final&eacute;, and even manages a few lighthearted moments amidst all the misery and death. It would be easy to berate Outbreak for being formulaic mainstream tosh, and many have, but if you can put logic on hold for a while it can be a whole lot of fun. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    While 'Outbreak' is a thoroughly entertaining film, there are too many holes in the plot for the film to be completely convincing. While the acting is good from all concerned parties, one gets the sense that the director, Wolfgang Petersen added too many unnecessary scenes to the film in an attempt to satisfy a wider audience. The first half of the film is excellent and the film develops at a rapid pace leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering how this very promising film is going to play out. However, the second half is disappointing as the film relies on predictable and superficial ways of pleasing the viewer, like the helicopter chase and the catching of the monkey. After watching the film, I thought it was good but it could have been a lot better had the director in the second half of the film focused more on the panic and terror that is created by the virus and how this fear manifests itself with the people. Instead we get a formulaic aerial chase, the good guy versus bad guy scenario and one wonders why when the film didn't really need this as the film has enough substance to carry it without these cheap devices.

    This film was gripping from start to finish and is lead by an all star cast including Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman (to name a few). The film basically is about a deadly virus that initially plagues California and then spreads to other areas of America and Dustin Hoffman and his team of Army personnel have to determine who or what is causing it. This film packs a perfect blend of drama, humour and tension so it does have a bit of something for everyone. What elevates this film is its strong script, excellent acting (particularly Dustin Hoffman who has already proved himself to be a brilliant actor after his Oscar winning performance in Rain Man- a personal favourite film of mine which is definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it). Another of the film's strengths is the interaction between the characters (the dialogue was great and never became dull) and I personally thought Hoffman and Spacey worked well together in this film. The only scene which didn't really ring true was the scene at the house in California where Hoffman and Gooding Jr send the little girl outside to coax the monkey out of the woods so that they could shoot it. What I couldn't understand is that they sent her outside with no protective clothing and no face mask (knowing or 'being pretty certain' that this monkey was the 'Host' which contains the virus). That seemed unrealistic to me. To sum up, Outbreak is an underrated film which deserves a much wider audience. This is an excellent thriller which is well worth your time. Enjoy!

    This is a very good example of a very right combination of very right ingredients - great actors (Russo, Hoffman, Freeman, Sutherland, Gooding, Spacey), great scenery, excellent plot, strong effects, correct amount of suspense, decent idea behind, and very good music (big thumbs to James Newton-Howard). This is a very captivating movie, not without goofs or weaker moments, but it is made very professionally and very endearingly. The 2 hours are long usually, but not here - they fly fast I do recommend this good movie. Of course, we must realize this was never attempted to be a masterpiece, but this is a very decent example of a suspense medical catastrophe movie and it does not have all the unnecessary pathetic speeches or shallow characters. The balance is measured well and healthily

    I chose to rent this on the basis of its very strong cast. Headed by Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman (who also do well) the movie also included names like Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Donald Sutherland. With names like that I had to assume at the very least that the performances would be strong. For the most part they were, although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock - which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine. The story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston, but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek, California. The disease is obviously a threat, and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels - an Army doctor trying to figure this out; Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford. When the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease, this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released "Contagion." The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening, but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. "Outbreak" avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in "Contagion." The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government. Where "Outbreak" fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller (basically the last 30-40 minutes) which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase. That was well done, but it went on far too long and after a while I just wanted to get on with the story. It's a big problem when you find the last half hour of a movie to be rather dull. And yet, up to that point it was doing a pretty good job with its basic story, and, frankly, I enjoyed watching this more than I enjoyed watching "Contagion." (6/10)

    I watched this movie last night and I liked it but I wish they had done more with it. They took it small and kind of happy which is not what this topic should be about in my opinion. However the cast is great including stars like Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman. This movie is about a doctor in the military who is supposed to control deadly diseases. A new deadly disease appears in Africa and he is sent to find out what it is. However a monkey has been sent to America that carries the disease. After infecting one guy the disease starts to spread like crazy killing anyone who gets infected. The doctor and his team are sent to cure it but he will soon find out that some people don't want that cure made and they will do anything to prevent its creation. This movie was a decent watch like I said though I think they should have done the movie on a larger scale.

    Every seemingly conceivable means of getting infected by a killer virus is explored and shown in detail - from sneezing in a movie theatre to having a tiny cut in a lab suit to having water spat on you by a monkey. This monkey (don't ask me what sort - I don't like them!) is captured in Africa to be sold for breeding in the U.S. But it carries a new strain of a virus, one that had been identified thirty years earlier. This being a nice little actioner, everything that can go wrong, does. "Only in the Movies" is a very apt description - or is it? We've had the scare of bird flu since and if you let yourself think too much, well, don't! There's quite a cast - Dustin Hoffman, who is/was married to Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman and Cuba Gooding Jnr. Oh, and Donald Sutherland crops up creepily as a military chief with a nasty streak. Unfortunately, Hoffman never looks as though he was ever married to Russo - they just look and sound poles apart, though after splitting up semi amicably at the start, inevitably (of course!) they end up working together against the clock and against the military, who have their own, more 'complete' ideas on how to contain the virus. It's all very watchable and director Wolfgang Peterson keeps things moving along nicely and with enough little details, some a little far- fetched, to keep up the tension. All in all, it's a neat way of packaging a medical and environmental action piece into an older family's movie and can be enjoyed by all except young children (there's some swearing). Oh - and there's some great looking make-up, which makes a lot of people look very unwell indeed!

    For years I avoided this film like well the plague. My inner critic informed me that it was just more Hollywood pap purpose built for the guileless and those less discerning. I should listen to my inner critic more Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), Casey (Kevin Spacey) and Saul (Cuba Gooding Jr) are a team of highly trained (and Oscar winning) army scientists. When they identify that an extremely lethal and highly contagious virus known as the Motaba strain has somehow made it to the continental United States they immediately relay news of the threat up the line of management. Only it seems that for some reason the powers that be  among whose numbers are Billy (Morgan Freeman) and McClintock (Donald Sutherland)  ain't listening, despite all the evidence, scientific graphs, diagrams and powerpoint charts that practically demand to the audience that they should. By the way all of the above have perfectly legitimate army ranks, but in a film this silly I like to refer to them as Sam, Billy and co Sam thinks that this new virus is reeeeeelllll bad, he tells his ex Robbie (Rene Russo), who is now a civilian scientist. Robbie initially ignores him just as Billy did, but when some gooey, pus-filled evidence oozes his way into her view she becomes more sympathetic to his claims, yet even with the mounting body count Billy and his superiors stubbornly dig in their heels, place their fingers in their ears and sing "la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaa" to drown out the facts  even when a small town in *gasp* heartland America becomes threatened by mass contagion. Sam, Saul and Casey show up and start dispensing with both assistance and claims that things will only get worse to anyone who will listen  which appears to be no-one. Billy arrives on the scene to demand no more talk about this bizarre cover-up, and a cast of mostly good (and in many cases award winning) actors wallow in this mediocrity for another 90 minutes of ennui. As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states. As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said "Show me the monkey!" I wouldn't have been surprised. Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich&eacute;d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting. I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot' Final Rating  4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie.

    I watched this movie last night and I liked it but I wish they had done more with it. They took it small and kind of happy which is not what this topic should be about in my opinion. However the cast is great including stars like Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman. This movie is about a doctor in the military who is supposed to control deadly diseases. A new deadly disease appears in Africa and he is sent to find out what it is. However a monkey has been sent to America that carries the disease. After infecting one guy the disease starts to spread like crazy killing anyone who gets infected. The doctor and his team are sent to cure it but he will soon find out that some people don't want that cure made and they will do anything to prevent its creation. This movie was a decent watch like I said though I think they should have done the movie on a larger scale.

    Every seemingly conceivable means of getting infected by a killer virus is explored and shown in detail - from sneezing in a movie theatre to having a tiny cut in a lab suit to having water spat on you by a monkey. This monkey (don't ask me what sort - I don't like them!) is captured in Africa to be sold for breeding in the U.S. But it carries a new strain of a virus, one that had been identified thirty years earlier. This being a nice little actioner, everything that can go wrong, does. "Only in the Movies" is a very apt description - or is it? We've had the scare of bird flu since and if you let yourself think too much, well, don't! There's quite a cast - Dustin Hoffman, who is/was married to Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman and Cuba Gooding Jnr. Oh, and Donald Sutherland crops up creepily as a military chief with a nasty streak. Unfortunately, Hoffman never looks as though he was ever married to Russo - they just look and sound poles apart, though after splitting up semi amicably at the start, inevitably (of course!) they end up working together against the clock and against the military, who have their own, more 'complete' ideas on how to contain the virus. It's all very watchable and director Wolfgang Peterson keeps things moving along nicely and with enough little details, some a little far- fetched, to keep up the tension. All in all, it's a neat way of packaging a medical and environmental action piece into an older family's movie and can be enjoyed by all except young children (there's some swearing). Oh - and there's some great looking make-up, which makes a lot of people look very unwell indeed!

    For years I avoided this film like well the plague. My inner critic informed me that it was just more Hollywood pap purpose built for the guileless and those less discerning. I should listen to my inner critic more Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), Casey (Kevin Spacey) and Saul (Cuba Gooding Jr) are a team of highly trained (and Oscar winning) army scientists. When they identify that an extremely lethal and highly contagious virus known as the Motaba strain has somehow made it to the continental United States they immediately relay news of the threat up the line of management. Only it seems that for some reason the powers that be  among whose numbers are Billy (Morgan Freeman) and McClintock (Donald Sutherland)  ain't listening, despite all the evidence, scientific graphs, diagrams and powerpoint charts that practically demand to the audience that they should. By the way all of the above have perfectly legitimate army ranks, but in a film this silly I like to refer to them as Sam, Billy and co Sam thinks that this new virus is reeeeeelllll bad, he tells his ex Robbie (Rene Russo), who is now a civilian scientist. Robbie initially ignores him just as Billy did, but when some gooey, pus-filled evidence oozes his way into her view she becomes more sympathetic to his claims, yet even with the mounting body count Billy and his superiors stubbornly dig in their heels, place their fingers in their ears and sing "la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaa" to drown out the facts  even when a small town in *gasp* heartland America becomes threatened by mass contagion. Sam, Saul and Casey show up and start dispensing with both assistance and claims that things will only get worse to anyone who will listen  which appears to be no-one. Billy arrives on the scene to demand no more talk about this bizarre cover-up, and a cast of mostly good (and in many cases award winning) actors wallow in this mediocrity for another 90 minutes of ennui. As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states. As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said "Show me the monkey!" I wouldn't have been surprised. Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich&eacute;d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting. I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot' Final Rating  4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie.

    When a disease in Africa is found , extreme measures are necessary to stop a rapacious epidemic , as dinky Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is sent to discover it . When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that's somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . Suspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood's usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with &uml;The Neverending story&uml; and &uml;Das Boot&uml; ,after that , he emigrated US where realized &uml;Night of shattered crystals&uml;, &uml;Enemy mine&uml; , and the successful &uml;Air Force one&uml;and &uml;The patriot&uml; , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake &uml;Poseidon&uml;.

    The Motaba virus in Outbreak is a particularly nasty agentfar more virulent than Ebolawhich arrives in the US via a cheeky little monkey illegally imported from Zaire. As the disease makes itself known, rapidly infecting a small Californian township, army scientist Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) and his crew must try to find a cure before despicable general McClintock (Donald Sutherland) carries out his plan to firebomb the area and its inhabitants. Being something of a germaphobe, I find Outbreak to be a genuinely scary movie, depicting the horrific scenario of a deadly viral epidemic hitting small-town America; the mere idea of microscopic bugs that can enter the body unseen and liquefy the internal organs really gets under my skin (pun intended), and if such a virus did hit the civilised Western world, I don't fancy the chances of Cuba Gooding Jr. cooking up a batch of anti-virus in time to save our collective ass. Extreme liberties are taken with medical facts and the film is pretty implausible at times, with a traditionally sappy happy Hollywood ending, but it still manages to be hugely entertaining nonsense: Director Wolfgang Petersen effectively feeds on his audience's paranoia, depicting 'Joe Public' succumbing to the illness in the the most innocuous of places, most notably in a movie theatre (a scene that really made me want to cover my mouth when I saw it on the big screen); he also shoehorns in a cool conspiracy subplota government cover-upmaking this perfect fodder for those with overactive imaginations. The film also packs in some big-budget blockbuster thrills, including a spectacular helicopter chase scene followed by a tense mid-air final&eacute;, and even manages a few lighthearted moments amidst all the misery and death. It would be easy to berate Outbreak for being formulaic mainstream tosh, and many have, but if you can put logic on hold for a while it can be a whole lot of fun. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    While 'Outbreak' is a thoroughly entertaining film, there are too many holes in the plot for the film to be completely convincing. While the acting is good from all concerned parties, one gets the sense that the director, Wolfgang Petersen added too many unnecessary scenes to the film in an attempt to satisfy a wider audience. The first half of the film is excellent and the film develops at a rapid pace leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering how this very promising film is going to play out. However, the second half is disappointing as the film relies on predictable and superficial ways of pleasing the viewer, like the helicopter chase and the catching of the monkey. After watching the film, I thought it was good but it could have been a lot better had the director in the second half of the film focused more on the panic and terror that is created by the virus and how this fear manifests itself with the people. Instead we get a formulaic aerial chase, the good guy versus bad guy scenario and one wonders why when the film didn't really need this as the film has enough substance to carry it without these cheap devices.

    This film was gripping from start to finish and is lead by an all star cast including Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman (to name a few). The film basically is about a deadly virus that initially plagues California and then spreads to other areas of America and Dustin Hoffman and his team of Army personnel have to determine who or what is causing it. This film packs a perfect blend of drama, humour and tension so it does have a bit of something for everyone. What elevates this film is its strong script, excellent acting (particularly Dustin Hoffman who has already proved himself to be a brilliant actor after his Oscar winning performance in Rain Man- a personal favourite film of mine which is definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it). Another of the film's strengths is the interaction between the characters (the dialogue was great and never became dull) and I personally thought Hoffman and Spacey worked well together in this film. The only scene which didn't really ring true was the scene at the house in California where Hoffman and Gooding Jr send the little girl outside to coax the monkey out of the woods so that they could shoot it. What I couldn't understand is that they sent her outside with no protective clothing and no face mask (knowing or 'being pretty certain' that this monkey was the 'Host' which contains the virus). That seemed unrealistic to me. To sum up, Outbreak is an underrated film which deserves a much wider audience. This is an excellent thriller which is well worth your time. Enjoy!

    This is a very good example of a very right combination of very right ingredients - great actors (Russo, Hoffman, Freeman, Sutherland, Gooding, Spacey), great scenery, excellent plot, strong effects, correct amount of suspense, decent idea behind, and very good music (big thumbs to James Newton-Howard). This is a very captivating movie, not without goofs or weaker moments, but it is made very professionally and very endearingly. The 2 hours are long usually, but not here - they fly fast I do recommend this good movie. Of course, we must realize this was never attempted to be a masterpiece, but this is a very decent example of a suspense medical catastrophe movie and it does not have all the unnecessary pathetic speeches or shallow characters. The balance is measured well and healthily

    I chose to rent this on the basis of its very strong cast. Headed by Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman (who also do well) the movie also included names like Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Donald Sutherland. With names like that I had to assume at the very least that the performances would be strong. For the most part they were, although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock - which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine. The story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston, but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek, California. The disease is obviously a threat, and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels - an Army doctor trying to figure this out; Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford. When the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease, this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released "Contagion." The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening, but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. "Outbreak" avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in "Contagion." The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government. Where "Outbreak" fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller (basically the last 30-40 minutes) which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase. That was well done, but it went on far too long and after a while I just wanted to get on with the story. It's a big problem when you find the last half hour of a movie to be rather dull. And yet, up to that point it was doing a pretty good job with its basic story, and, frankly, I enjoyed watching this more than I enjoyed watching "Contagion." (6/10)

However, the second half is disappointing as the film relies on predictable and superficial ways of pleasing the viewer, like the helicopter chase and the catching of the monkey. After watching the film, I thought it was good but it could have been a lot better had the director in the second half of the film focused more on the panic and terror that is created by the virus and how this fear manifests itself with the people. Instead we get a formulaic aerial chase, the good guy versus bad guy scenario and one wonders why when the film didn't really need this as the film has enough substance to carry it without these cheap devices.

    This film was gripping from start to finish and is lead by an all star cast including Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman (to name a few). The film basically is about a deadly virus that initially plagues California and then spreads to other areas of America and Dustin Hoffman and his team of Army personnel have to determine who or what is causing it. This film packs a perfect blend of drama, humour and tension so it does have a bit of something for everyone. What elevates this film is its strong script, excellent acting (particularly Dustin Hoffman who has already proved himself to be a brilliant actor after his Oscar winning performance in Rain Man- a personal favourite film of mine which is definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it). Another of the film's strengths is the interaction between the characters (the dialogue was great and never became dull) and I personally thought Hoffman and Spacey worked well together in this film. The only scene which didn't really ring true was the scene at the house in California where Hoffman and Gooding Jr send the little girl outside to coax the monkey out of the woods so that they could shoot it. What I couldn't understand is that they sent her outside with no protective clothing and no face mask (knowing or 'being pretty certain' that this monkey was the 'Host' which contains the virus). That seemed unrealistic to me. To sum up, Outbreak is an underrated film which deserves a much wider audience. This is an excellent thriller which is well worth your time. Enjoy!

    This is a very good example of a very right combination of very right ingredients - great actors (Russo, Hoffman, Freeman, Sutherland, Gooding, Spacey), great scenery, excellent plot, strong effects, correct amount of suspense, decent idea behind, and very good music (big thumbs to James Newton-Howard). This is a very captivating movie, not without goofs or weaker moments, but it is made very professionally and very endearingly. The 2 hours are long usually, but not here - they fly fast I do recommend this good movie. Of course, we must realize this was never attempted to be a masterpiece, but this is a very decent example of a suspense medical catastrophe movie and it does not have all the unnecessary pathetic speeches or shallow characters. The balance is measured well and healthily

    I chose to rent this on the basis of its very strong cast. Headed by Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman (who also do well) the movie also included names like Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Donald Sutherland. With names like that I had to assume at the very least that the performances would be strong. For the most part they were, although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock - which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine. The story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston, but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek, California. The disease is obviously a threat, and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels - an Army doctor trying to figure this out; Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford. When the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease, this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released "Contagion." The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening, but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. "Outbreak" avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in "Contagion." The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government. Where "Outbreak" fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller (basically the last 30-40 minutes) which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase. That was well done, but it went on far too long and after a while I just wanted to get on with the story. It's a big problem when you find the last half hour of a movie to be rather dull. And yet, up to that point it was doing a pretty good job with its basic story, and, frankly, I enjoyed watching this more than I enjoyed watching "Contagion." (6/10)

    I watched this movie last night and I liked it but I wish they had done more with it. They took it small and kind of happy which is not what this topic should be about in my opinion. However the cast is great including stars like Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman. This movie is about a doctor in the military who is supposed to control deadly diseases. A new deadly disease appears in Africa and he is sent to find out what it is. However a monkey has been sent to America that carries the disease. After infecting one guy the disease starts to spread like crazy killing anyone who gets infected. The doctor and his team are sent to cure it but he will soon find out that some people don't want that cure made and they will do anything to prevent its creation. This movie was a decent watch like I said though I think they should have done the movie on a larger scale.

    Every seemingly conceivable means of getting infected by a killer virus is explored and shown in detail - from sneezing in a movie theatre to having a tiny cut in a lab suit to having water spat on you by a monkey. This monkey (don't ask me what sort - I don't like them!) is captured in Africa to be sold for breeding in the U.S. But it carries a new strain of a virus, one that had been identified thirty years earlier. This being a nice little actioner, everything that can go wrong, does. "Only in the Movies" is a very apt description - or is it? We've had the scare of bird flu since and if you let yourself think too much, well, don't! There's quite a cast - Dustin Hoffman, who is/was married to Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman and Cuba Gooding Jnr. Oh, and Donald Sutherland crops up creepily as a military chief with a nasty streak. Unfortunately, Hoffman never looks as though he was ever married to Russo - they just look and sound poles apart, though after splitting up semi amicably at the start, inevitably (of course!) they end up working together against the clock and against the military, who have their own, more 'complete' ideas on how to contain the virus. It's all very watchable and director Wolfgang Peterson keeps things moving along nicely and with enough little details, some a little far- fetched, to keep up the tension. All in all, it's a neat way of packaging a medical and environmental action piece into an older family's movie and can be enjoyed by all except young children (there's some swearing). Oh - and there's some great looking make-up, which makes a lot of people look very unwell indeed!

    For years I avoided this film like well the plague. My inner critic informed me that it was just more Hollywood pap purpose built for the guileless and those less discerning. I should listen to my inner critic more Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), Casey (Kevin Spacey) and Saul (Cuba Gooding Jr) are a team of highly trained (and Oscar winning) army scientists. When they identify that an extremely lethal and highly contagious virus known as the Motaba strain has somehow made it to the continental United States they immediately relay news of the threat up the line of management. Only it seems that for some reason the powers that be  among whose numbers are Billy (Morgan Freeman) and McClintock (Donald Sutherland)  ain't listening, despite all the evidence, scientific graphs, diagrams and powerpoint charts that practically demand to the audience that they should. By the way all of the above have perfectly legitimate army ranks, but in a film this silly I like to refer to them as Sam, Billy and co Sam thinks that this new virus is reeeeeelllll bad, he tells his ex Robbie (Rene Russo), who is now a civilian scientist. Robbie initially ignores him just as Billy did, but when some gooey, pus-filled evidence oozes his way into her view she becomes more sympathetic to his claims, yet even with the mounting body count Billy and his superiors stubbornly dig in their heels, place their fingers in their ears and sing "la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaa" to drown out the facts  even when a small town in *gasp* heartland America becomes threatened by mass contagion. Sam, Saul and Casey show up and start dispensing with both assistance and claims that things will only get worse to anyone who will listen  which appears to be no-one. Billy arrives on the scene to demand no more talk about this bizarre cover-up, and a cast of mostly good (and in many cases award winning) actors wallow in this mediocrity for another 90 minutes of ennui. As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states. As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said "Show me the monkey!" I wouldn't have been surprised. Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich&eacute;d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting. I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot' Final Rating  4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie.

    When a disease in Africa is found , extreme measures are necessary to stop a rapacious epidemic , as dinky Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is sent to discover it . When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that's somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . Suspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood's usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with &uml;The Neverending story&uml; and &uml;Das Boot&uml; ,after that , he emigrated US where realized &uml;Night of shattered crystals&uml;, &uml;Enemy mine&uml; , and the successful &uml;Air Force one&uml;and &uml;The patriot&uml; , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake &uml;Poseidon&uml;. Rating : well worth watching , better than average .

    The Motaba virus in Outbreak is a particularly nasty agentfar more virulent than Ebolawhich arrives in the US via a cheeky little monkey illegally imported from Zaire. As the disease makes itself known, rapidly infecting a small Californian township, army scientist Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) and his crew must try to find a cure before despicable general McClintock (Donald Sutherland) carries out his plan to firebomb the area and its inhabitants. Being something of a germaphobe, I find Outbreak to be a genuinely scary movie, depicting the horrific scenario of a deadly viral epidemic hitting small-town America; the mere idea of microscopic bugs that can enter the body unseen and liquefy the internal organs really gets under my skin (pun intended), and if such a virus did hit the civilised Western world, I don't fancy the chances of Cuba Gooding Jr. cooking up a batch of anti-virus in time to save our collective ass. Extreme liberties are taken with medical facts and the film is pretty implausible at times, with a traditionally sappy happy Hollywood ending, but it still manages to be hugely entertaining nonsense: Director Wolfgang Petersen effectively feeds on his audience's paranoia, depicting 'Joe Public' succumbing to the illness in the the most innocuous of places, most notably in a movie theatre (a scene that really made me want to cover my mouth when I saw it on the big screen); he also shoehorns in a cool conspiracy subplota government cover-upmaking this perfect fodder for those with overactive imaginations. The film also packs in some big-budget blockbuster thrills, including a spectacular helicopter chase scene followed by a tense mid-air final&eacute;, and even manages a few lighthearted moments amidst all the misery and death. It would be easy to berate Outbreak for being formulaic mainstream tosh, and many have, but if you can put logic on hold for a while it can be a whole lot of fun. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    While 'Outbreak' is a thoroughly entertaining film, there are too many holes in the plot for the film to be completely convincing. While the acting is good from all concerned parties, one gets the sense that the director, Wolfgang Petersen added too many unnecessary scenes to the film in an attempt to satisfy a wider audience. The first half of the film is excellent and the film develops at a rapid pace leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering how this very promising film is going to play out.

As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states. As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said "Show me the monkey!" I wouldn't have been surprised. Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich&eacute;d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting. I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot' Final Rating  4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie.

    When a disease in Africa is found , extreme measures are necessary to stop a rapacious epidemic , as dinky Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is sent to discover it . When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that's somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . Suspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood's usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with &uml;The Neverending story&uml; and &uml;Das Boot&uml; ,after that , he emigrated US where realized &uml;Night of shattered crystals&uml;, &uml;Enemy mine&uml; , and the successful &uml;Air Force one&uml;and &uml;The patriot&uml; , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake &uml;Poseidon&uml;. Rating : well worth watching , better than average .

    The Motaba virus in Outbreak is a particularly nasty agentfar more virulent than Ebolawhich arrives in the US via a cheeky little monkey illegally imported from Zaire. As the disease makes itself known, rapidly infecting a small Californian township, army scientist Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) and his crew must try to find a cure before despicable general McClintock (Donald Sutherland) carries out his plan to firebomb the area and its inhabitants. Being something of a germaphobe, I find Outbreak to be a genuinely scary movie, depicting the horrific scenario of a deadly viral epidemic hitting small-town America; the mere idea of microscopic bugs that can enter the body unseen and liquefy the internal organs really gets under my skin (pun intended), and if such a virus did hit the civilised Western world, I don't fancy the chances of Cuba Gooding Jr. cooking up a batch of anti-virus in time to save our collective ass. Extreme liberties are taken with medical facts and the film is pretty implausible at times, with a traditionally sappy happy Hollywood ending, but it still manages to be hugely entertaining nonsense: Director Wolfgang Petersen effectively feeds on his audience's paranoia, depicting 'Joe Public' succumbing to the illness in the the most innocuous of places, most notably in a movie theatre (a scene that really made me want to cover my mouth when I saw it on the big screen); he also shoehorns in a cool conspiracy subplota government cover-upmaking this perfect fodder for those with overactive imaginations. The film also packs in some big-budget blockbuster thrills, including a spectacular helicopter chase scene followed by a tense mid-air final&eacute;, and even manages a few lighthearted moments amidst all the misery and death. It would be easy to berate Outbreak for being formulaic mainstream tosh, and many have, but if you can put logic on hold for a while it can be a whole lot of fun. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
