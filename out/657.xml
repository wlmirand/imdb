 <sinopse>
  A former Korean War POW is brainwashed by Communists into becoming a political assassin. But another former prisoner may know how to save him.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Major Ben Marco is an intelligence officer in the U.S. Army. He served valiantly as a captain in the Korean war and his Sergeant, Raymond Shaw, even won the Medal of Honor. Marco has a major problem however: he has a recurring nightmare, one where two members of his squad are killed by Shaw. He's put on indefinite sick leave and visits Shaw in New York. Shaw for his part has established himself well, despite the misgivings of his domineering mother, Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin. She is a red-baiter, accusing anyone who disagrees with her right-wing reactionary views of being a Communist. Raymond hates her, not only for how she's treated him but equally because of his step-father, the ineffectual U.S. Senator John Iselin, who is intent on seeking higher office. When Marco learns that others in his Korean War unit have nightmares similar to his own, he realizes that something happened to all of them in Korea and that Raymond Shaw is the focal point.

    Frank Sinatra plays Major Ben Marco, who has chronic nightmares about Sergeant Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) killing members of their unit after they were POWs during the Korean War. Turns out, they were both brainwashed by scientists from Manchuria in an experiment that directly involves Raymond, and then his (publicly) anti-communist mother(unforgettably played by Angela Lansbury) who is pushing her indecisive Senator husband Iselin, played by James Gregory, to make a name for himself by publicly naming 57 communists in the government. All are involved in an assassination plot that will shatter their lives, and affect the country forever... Brilliant conspiracy theory film is supremely well directed by John Frankenheimer, as are the performances of the whole cast, with an inspired & daring plot with many twists and turns, and is also deeply subversive for both sides(left & right) that still makes it relevant today, and remains profoundly cynical about politicians and politics, making it a truly classic, prescient thriller.

    Excellent movie overall. One glaring flaw; the scene in which Raymond kills the senator and his wife with a silencer on a revolver is ridiculous. Anyone who knows anything about weapons knows that a silencer will NOT work on a revolver, only semi-automatic weapons. Silencer on revolver will do no good in that the noise is released due to revolver design. This I believe is the first time I've seen this really bad mistake in a movie of this importance. This is the second time I have submitted this fact and it as yet has not made it to publication. I hope this glaring discrepancy is corrected this time and it will not be necessary to repeat this.

    I had expected 'The Manchurian Candidate' to be a political thriller but it turned out to be much more than. The element of psychology is very crucial here and the plot is quite clever despite being far-fetched at times (an example being the Communists leaving their plan of world domination in the hands of an uncontrolled soldier). The key idea, derived from of Pavlov's experiments is quite inventive and the way the story unfolds, leaves the viewer in suspense. 'The MC' also touches on various other themes such as incest, which are cleverly weaved into the story. The tension is exceptionally well built. The nightmare sequences, the scenes between Raymond and his mother and between Raymond and Marco are among the highlights. The cinematography is also noteworthy especially in the interaction sequences. The cast is very good. Frank Sinatra is brilliant but this is more Laurence Harvey's film and he does a smoothe job of playing a complex figure who is arrogant and self-centered, loving and guilt ridden and a cold blooded killer. Janet Leigh has a brief part which is done quite adequately and with some class but, in my opinion, it's Angela Lansbury who transcends as the power-hungry, conniving, manipulative and obsessive mother. I had never seen her in a negative role. simply put, she's mindblowing. 'The Manchurian Candidate' is dark, clever, chilling and, to an extent, even ahead of its time. It's one of the finest thrillers that have stood the test of time.

    Brainwashing is a goofy premise for a movie, but The Manchurian Candidate is so good, alternately dark and funny, that it's forgivable. The film walks a fine line between silly and serious. The villains, an empty- headed McCarthy-like senator and his conniving wife, are caricatures, far too exaggerated to work as satire, but Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey's performances as damaged ex-soldiers are played perfectly straight and with deep respect for the subject matter. This is a creative and sometimes heartbreaking thriller, if not a particularly thought-provoking one. Character actor John McGiver, recognizable from bit roles in movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Midnight Cowboy, excels as an affable patrician senator.

    There are simply not enough letters in the Summary to cover what this movie achieves. Angela Lansbury, in an interview on the DVD, says that everyone (all the actors) has at least one great scene in the movie. I would go a bit further than that and say everyone has great scenes...all of them. That is near to impossible to do, but John Frankenhemier did it. Quick Note: If you are watching on the DVD, absolutely DO NOT watch the interviews or specials before watching the movie; they are filled with spoilers! This is considered by many to be Frank Sinatra's best movie; I agree. I'm not a fan of Frank, but he gives a very deep and believable performance in this picture. He also was instrumental behind the scenes in getting the picture made. John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988). Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie. The suspense and tension, maintained throughout, come from several sources, but chief among them is that very little is explained before it happens. In many ways, you learn at the same time as the characters. And yes, there is a twist in the climax, so don't blink. Just an excellent movie.

    I have seen this movie several times since it first came out. I now realize it stinks. The only thing I liked was the "portal" into the world of 50 years ago. Otherwise the plot doesn't hang together at all. First, we're supposed to believe that it is somehow "the Right" who are the Communists. No doubt this was due to the media's acceptance at the time of the anti-anti-Communist stance. By this viewpoint the anti-Communists were the "real Communists". The real-real Communists--the Soviets, Chinese, Cubans, etc.--were misunderstood builders of paradise. The "real Communists" were buffoons like James Gregory's character who make up conspiracies as easily as Heinz makes ketchup. Gregory's character is clearly based on Joe McCarthy and the movie repeats the media trope that he just pulled the number of commies (in the State Department, not Defense) out of thin air (Heinz' 57 for 57 Communists). Second, we are to asked to believe the Communists, clever enough to program human beings, would be so clumsy as to place one of their human robot assassins close to the very person they are trying to get installed as President? Seems unlikely especially considering that when Laurance Harvey kills John McGiver, he is in a zombie like state and thus not too attentive to whether he might be leaving evidence to connect him with the crime?

    The Manchurian Candidate, released in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis is frequently offered up as a symbol of Cold War paranoia: the war has come home, and even an all-American war hero could be a secret assassin. But at the same time it's a surreal satire on that paranoia, from the memorable juxtaposition of a genteel garden party and a Communist war council to the absurd terms of the hypnosis to the bumbling ineptness of the film's McCarthy stand-in. At the same time it's a Freudian drama revolving around a repressed, frigid son and a controlling mother. In weaving together the political and the psychoanalytical inside the generic conventions of the spy genre The Manchurian Candidate turns out to be a better Hitchcock movie than anything Hitch ever directed. The film never lags, but it takes its time establishing its characters and their motivations, as well as the web of political tension underlying everything. It's willing to spend twenty minutes moving plot pieces around, and those twenty minutes will go by like five. The performances of Laurence Harvey and Angela Landsbury as Raymond Shaw and his mother anchor the film and make it both human and profoundly cold. (Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns. Beyond a couple of clunky plot contrivances and the usual Freudian misogyny, The Manchurian Candidate is a remarkable film that works as both a genre piece and as a social commentary. Like Dr. Strangelove (with which it would make an excellent double bill), it both emblematizes the height of Cold War paranoia and skewers it. Classic film buffs will already be well acquainted with it, but even for those who usually steer clear of anything black and white, it's well worth watching.

    The Manchurian Candidate's pace is very tasteful and gentle; it keeps you on the edge and then spins you out of sync when some unforeseen and probably unexplainable scenes pop up, but then the events pull you back in, in a most masterful and surreal way as you wait to see all the events matchup. The Manchurian Candidate is a mix of suspense, thriller and the dialogues are very intense and to some, it could be seen to possess some dark humor. The unveiling of the mastermind behind the whole plot in the movie, or better still the mastermind behind the control of Raymond Shaw makes you the viewer raise an eye lid of the depth many will go for power. The movies conspiracy theory and mix of some kind of Sci-Fi in the whole brainwashing and mind control aspect of the film, makes The Manchurian Candidate more appealing to a variety of audience. The plot is about a squad in the Korean War, where the Major, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and his Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), returned home to be well received and Shaw even got a medal of honor for his exploits of saving his squad during the war. As Shaw grew to be in the public eye driven by his ever bearing mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury), Marco starts having recurring nightmares, where he sees Shaw kill two of his squad members and the nightmare led him to believe that the whole story he knows to have happened in Korea may not be real. John Frankenheimer the director and also the producer did a fine job on the screenplay based on a Richard Condon's 1959 novel of the same name, both film and novel are about the cold war and the acting by star actor and musician Frank Sinatra is one that needs to be seen. Angela Lansbury (Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971) who plays the role of the mother of Raymond Shaw got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for her wonderful portrayal of Mrs Iselin. The Manchurian Candidate was both a critical and financial success one that many should see, including you. Every moment you spend watching this film you will love and remember. The suspense keeps you glued. A remake of this 1962 classic was done by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner of Best Director for the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and the critical acclaimed Philadelphia in 1993 also starring Denzel Washington) in 2004, and it starred Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, it was a critical success but not much of a box office success like it's 1962 predecessor. www.lagsreviews.com

    Few things are as disappointing as watching a "classic" film you've heard so many wonderful things about which doesn't end up matching the hype. The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone. The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fianc&eacute;e to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained. Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong. Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that "shocking" end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them. There's a great story in this film someplace. But the film doesn't do that story justice.

    It turns out China really did send back "Manchurian Candidates" after the Korean War, but a less sophisticated kind than in the movie: http://www.koreanconfidential.com/manchuriancandidatesreport.html KorCon recently told you about a Top Secret program to monitor, and sometimes hold back, pro-communist letters from US POWs in Korea. U.S. intelligence secretly opened letters sent by U.S. POWs to their families. If the letters contained communist propaganda or suspected secret messages, they were not delivered. We ran across an interesting twist in those previously classified Pentagon records, which show the letter-opening project ran into at least one delicate situation. When intelligence officials opened two letters from a U.S. prisoner, they found that one was a letter to the man's wife and the second was a suggestive message to another women. But the letters had been put into the wrong envelopes. The intelligence officials didn't know whether the man had goofed or the communists were testing to see whether the mail was opened in the U.S. It's unclear whether the Pentagon sent the letters to their proper reciepients, or, more likely, kept their operation secret by allowing the embarrassing mistake to occur, leaving the prisoner with some tough questions to answer when he returned home.

    The Manchurian Candidate's pace is very tasteful and gentle; it keeps you on the edge and then spins you out of sync when some unforeseen and probably unexplainable scenes pop up, but then the events pull you back in, in a most masterful and surreal way as you wait to see all the events matchup. The Manchurian Candidate is a mix of suspense, thriller and the dialogues are very intense and to some, it could be seen to possess some dark humor. The unveiling of the mastermind behind the whole plot in the movie, or better still the mastermind behind the control of Raymond Shaw makes you the viewer raise an eye lid of the depth many will go for power. The movies conspiracy theory and mix of some kind of Sci-Fi in the whole brainwashing and mind control aspect of the film, makes The Manchurian Candidate more appealing to a variety of audience. The plot is about a squad in the Korean War, where the Major, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and his Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), returned home to be well received and Shaw even got a medal of honor for his exploits of saving his squad during the war. As Shaw grew to be in the public eye driven by his ever bearing mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury), Marco starts having recurring nightmares, where he sees Shaw kill two of his squad members and the nightmare led him to believe that the whole story he knows to have happened in Korea may not be real. John Frankenheimer the director and also the producer did a fine job on the screenplay based on a Richard Condon's 1959 novel of the same name, both film and novel are about the cold war and the acting by star actor and musician Frank Sinatra is one that needs to be seen. Angela Lansbury (Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971) who plays the role of the mother of Raymond Shaw got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for her wonderful portrayal of Mrs Iselin. The Manchurian Candidate was both a critical and financial success one that many should see, including you. Every moment you spend watching this film you will love and remember. The suspense keeps you glued. A remake of this 1962 classic was done by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner of Best Director for the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and the critical acclaimed Philadelphia in 1993 also starring Denzel Washington) in 2004, and it starred Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, it was a critical success but not much of a box office success like it's 1962 predecessor. www.lagsreviews.com

    Few things are as disappointing as watching a "classic" film you've heard so many wonderful things about which doesn't end up matching the hype. The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone. The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fianc&eacute;e to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained. Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong. Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that "shocking" end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them. There's a great story in this film someplace. But the film doesn't do that story justice.

    It turns out China really did send back "Manchurian Candidates" after the Korean War, but a less sophisticated kind than in the movie: http://www.koreanconfidential.com/manchuriancandidatesreport.html KorCon recently told you about a Top Secret program to monitor, and sometimes hold back, pro-communist letters from US POWs in Korea. U.S. intelligence secretly opened letters sent by U.S. POWs to their families. If the letters contained communist propaganda or suspected secret messages, they were not delivered. We ran across an interesting twist in those previously classified Pentagon records, which show the letter-opening project ran into at least one delicate situation. When intelligence officials opened two letters from a U.S. prisoner, they found that one was a letter to the man's wife and the second was a suggestive message to another women. But the letters had been put into the wrong envelopes. The intelligence officials didn't know whether the man had goofed or the communists were testing to see whether the mail was opened in the U.S. It's unclear whether the Pentagon sent the letters to their proper reciepients, or, more likely, kept their operation secret by allowing the embarrassing mistake to occur, leaving the prisoner with some tough questions to answer when he returned home.

    Frank Sinatra plays Major Ben Marco, who has chronic nightmares about Sergeant Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) killing members of their unit after they were POWs during the Korean War. Turns out, they were both brainwashed by scientists from Manchuria in an experiment that directly involves Raymond, and then his (publicly) anti-communist mother(unforgettably played by Angela Lansbury) who is pushing her indecisive Senator husband Iselin, played by James Gregory, to make a name for himself by publicly naming 57 communists in the government. All are involved in an assassination plot that will shatter their lives, and affect the country forever... Brilliant conspiracy theory film is supremely well directed by John Frankenheimer, as are the performances of the whole cast, with an inspired & daring plot with many twists and turns, and is also deeply subversive for both sides(left & right) that still makes it relevant today, and remains profoundly cynical about politicians and politics, making it a truly classic, prescient thriller.

    Excellent movie overall. One glaring flaw; the scene in which Raymond kills the senator and his wife with a silencer on a revolver is ridiculous. Anyone who knows anything about weapons knows that a silencer will NOT work on a revolver, only semi-automatic weapons. Silencer on revolver will do no good in that the noise is released due to revolver design. This I believe is the first time I've seen this really bad mistake in a movie of this importance. This is the second time I have submitted this fact and it as yet has not made it to publication. I hope this glaring discrepancy is corrected this time and it will not be necessary to repeat this.

    I had expected 'The Manchurian Candidate' to be a political thriller but it turned out to be much more than. The element of psychology is very crucial here and the plot is quite clever despite being far-fetched at times (an example being the Communists leaving their plan of world domination in the hands of an uncontrolled soldier). The key idea, derived from of Pavlov's experiments is quite inventive and the way the story unfolds, leaves the viewer in suspense. 'The MC' also touches on various other themes such as incest, which are cleverly weaved into the story. The tension is exceptionally well built. The nightmare sequences, the scenes between Raymond and his mother and between Raymond and Marco are among the highlights. The cinematography is also noteworthy especially in the interaction sequences. The cast is very good. Frank Sinatra is brilliant but this is more Laurence Harvey's film and he does a smoothe job of playing a complex figure who is arrogant and self-centered, loving and guilt ridden and a cold blooded killer. Janet Leigh has a brief part which is done quite adequately and with some class but, in my opinion, it's Angela Lansbury who transcends as the power-hungry, conniving, manipulative and obsessive mother. I had never seen her in a negative role. simply put, she's mindblowing. 'The Manchurian Candidate' is dark, clever, chilling and, to an extent, even ahead of its time. It's one of the finest thrillers that have stood the test of time.

    Brainwashing is a goofy premise for a movie, but The Manchurian Candidate is so good, alternately dark and funny, that it's forgivable. The film walks a fine line between silly and serious. The villains, an empty- headed McCarthy-like senator and his conniving wife, are caricatures, far too exaggerated to work as satire, but Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey's performances as damaged ex-soldiers are played perfectly straight and with deep respect for the subject matter. This is a creative and sometimes heartbreaking thriller, if not a particularly thought-provoking one. Character actor John McGiver, recognizable from bit roles in movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Midnight Cowboy, excels as an affable patrician senator.

    There are simply not enough letters in the Summary to cover what this movie achieves. Angela Lansbury, in an interview on the DVD, says that everyone (all the actors) has at least one great scene in the movie. I would go a bit further than that and say everyone has great scenes...all of them. That is near to impossible to do, but John Frankenhemier did it. Quick Note: If you are watching on the DVD, absolutely DO NOT watch the interviews or specials before watching the movie; they are filled with spoilers! This is considered by many to be Frank Sinatra's best movie; I agree. I'm not a fan of Frank, but he gives a very deep and believable performance in this picture. He also was instrumental behind the scenes in getting the picture made. John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988). Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie. The suspense and tension, maintained throughout, come from several sources, but chief among them is that very little is explained before it happens. In many ways, you learn at the same time as the characters. And yes, there is a twist in the climax, so don't blink. Just an excellent movie.

    I have seen this movie several times since it first came out. I now realize it stinks. The only thing I liked was the "portal" into the world of 50 years ago. Otherwise the plot doesn't hang together at all. First, we're supposed to believe that it is somehow "the Right" who are the Communists. No doubt this was due to the media's acceptance at the time of the anti-anti-Communist stance. By this viewpoint the anti-Communists were the "real Communists". The real-real Communists--the Soviets, Chinese, Cubans, etc.--were misunderstood builders of paradise. The "real Communists" were buffoons like James Gregory's character who make up conspiracies as easily as Heinz makes ketchup. Gregory's character is clearly based on Joe McCarthy and the movie repeats the media trope that he just pulled the number of commies (in the State Department, not Defense) out of thin air (Heinz' 57 for 57 Communists). Second, we are to asked to believe the Communists, clever enough to program human beings, would be so clumsy as to place one of their human robot assassins close to the very person they are trying to get installed as President? Seems unlikely especially considering that when Laurance Harvey kills John McGiver, he is in a zombie like state and thus not too attentive to whether he might be leaving evidence to connect him with the crime?

    The Manchurian Candidate, released in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis is frequently offered up as a symbol of Cold War paranoia: the war has come home, and even an all-American war hero could be a secret assassin. But at the same time it's a surreal satire on that paranoia, from the memorable juxtaposition of a genteel garden party and a Communist war council to the absurd terms of the hypnosis to the bumbling ineptness of the film's McCarthy stand-in. At the same time it's a Freudian drama revolving around a repressed, frigid son and a controlling mother. In weaving together the political and the psychoanalytical inside the generic conventions of the spy genre The Manchurian Candidate turns out to be a better Hitchcock movie than anything Hitch ever directed. The film never lags, but it takes its time establishing its characters and their motivations, as well as the web of political tension underlying everything. It's willing to spend twenty minutes moving plot pieces around, and those twenty minutes will go by like five. The performances of Laurence Harvey and Angela Landsbury as Raymond Shaw and his mother anchor the film and make it both human and profoundly cold. (Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns. Beyond a couple of clunky plot contrivances and the usual Freudian misogyny, The Manchurian Candidate is a remarkable film that works as both a genre piece and as a social commentary. Like Dr. Strangelove (with which it would make an excellent double bill), it both emblematizes the height of Cold War paranoia and skewers it. Classic film buffs will already be well acquainted with it, but even for those who usually steer clear of anything black and white, it's well worth watching.

John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988). Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie. The suspense and tension, maintained throughout, come from several sources, but chief among them is that very little is explained before it happens. In many ways, you learn at the same time as the characters. And yes, there is a twist in the climax, so don't blink. Just an excellent movie.

    I have seen this movie several times since it first came out. I now realize it stinks. The only thing I liked was the "portal" into the world of 50 years ago. Otherwise the plot doesn't hang together at all. First, we're supposed to believe that it is somehow "the Right" who are the Communists. No doubt this was due to the media's acceptance at the time of the anti-anti-Communist stance. By this viewpoint the anti-Communists were the "real Communists". The real-real Communists--the Soviets, Chinese, Cubans, etc.--were misunderstood builders of paradise. The "real Communists" were buffoons like James Gregory's character who make up conspiracies as easily as Heinz makes ketchup. Gregory's character is clearly based on Joe McCarthy and the movie repeats the media trope that he just pulled the number of commies (in the State Department, not Defense) out of thin air (Heinz' 57 for 57 Communists). Second, we are to asked to believe the Communists, clever enough to program human beings, would be so clumsy as to place one of their human robot assassins close to the very person they are trying to get installed as President? Seems unlikely especially considering that when Laurance Harvey kills John McGiver, he is in a zombie like state and thus not too attentive to whether he might be leaving evidence to connect him with the crime?

    The Manchurian Candidate, released in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis is frequently offered up as a symbol of Cold War paranoia: the war has come home, and even an all-American war hero could be a secret assassin. But at the same time it's a surreal satire on that paranoia, from the memorable juxtaposition of a genteel garden party and a Communist war council to the absurd terms of the hypnosis to the bumbling ineptness of the film's McCarthy stand-in. At the same time it's a Freudian drama revolving around a repressed, frigid son and a controlling mother. In weaving together the political and the psychoanalytical inside the generic conventions of the spy genre The Manchurian Candidate turns out to be a better Hitchcock movie than anything Hitch ever directed. The film never lags, but it takes its time establishing its characters and their motivations, as well as the web of political tension underlying everything. It's willing to spend twenty minutes moving plot pieces around, and those twenty minutes will go by like five. The performances of Laurence Harvey and Angela Landsbury as Raymond Shaw and his mother anchor the film and make it both human and profoundly cold. (Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns. Beyond a couple of clunky plot contrivances and the usual Freudian misogyny, The Manchurian Candidate is a remarkable film that works as both a genre piece and as a social commentary. Like Dr. Strangelove (with which it would make an excellent double bill), it both emblematizes the height of Cold War paranoia and skewers it. Classic film buffs will already be well acquainted with it, but even for those who usually steer clear of anything black and white, it's well worth watching.

    The Manchurian Candidate's pace is very tasteful and gentle; it keeps you on the edge and then spins you out of sync when some unforeseen and probably unexplainable scenes pop up, but then the events pull you back in, in a most masterful and surreal way as you wait to see all the events matchup. The Manchurian Candidate is a mix of suspense, thriller and the dialogues are very intense and to some, it could be seen to possess some dark humor. The unveiling of the mastermind behind the whole plot in the movie, or better still the mastermind behind the control of Raymond Shaw makes you the viewer raise an eye lid of the depth many will go for power. The movies conspiracy theory and mix of some kind of Sci-Fi in the whole brainwashing and mind control aspect of the film, makes The Manchurian Candidate more appealing to a variety of audience. The plot is about a squad in the Korean War, where the Major, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and his Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), returned home to be well received and Shaw even got a medal of honor for his exploits of saving his squad during the war. As Shaw grew to be in the public eye driven by his ever bearing mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury), Marco starts having recurring nightmares, where he sees Shaw kill two of his squad members and the nightmare led him to believe that the whole story he knows to have happened in Korea may not be real. John Frankenheimer the director and also the producer did a fine job on the screenplay based on a Richard Condon's 1959 novel of the same name, both film and novel are about the cold war and the acting by star actor and musician Frank Sinatra is one that needs to be seen. Angela Lansbury (Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971) who plays the role of the mother of Raymond Shaw got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for her wonderful portrayal of Mrs Iselin. The Manchurian Candidate was both a critical and financial success one that many should see, including you. Every moment you spend watching this film you will love and remember. The suspense keeps you glued. A remake of this 1962 classic was done by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner of Best Director for the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and the critical acclaimed Philadelphia in 1993 also starring Denzel Washington) in 2004, and it starred Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, it was a critical success but not much of a box office success like it's 1962 predecessor. www.lagsreviews.com

    Few things are as disappointing as watching a "classic" film you've heard so many wonderful things about which doesn't end up matching the hype. The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone. The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fianc&eacute;e to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained. Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong. Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that "shocking" end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them. There's a great story in this film someplace. But the film doesn't do that story justice.

    It turns out China really did send back "Manchurian Candidates" after the Korean War, but a less sophisticated kind than in the movie: http://www.koreanconfidential.com/manchuriancandidatesreport.html KorCon recently told you about a Top Secret program to monitor, and sometimes hold back, pro-communist letters from US POWs in Korea. U.S. intelligence secretly opened letters sent by U.S. POWs to their families. If the letters contained communist propaganda or suspected secret messages, they were not delivered. We ran across an interesting twist in those previously classified Pentagon records, which show the letter-opening project ran into at least one delicate situation. When intelligence officials opened two letters from a U.S. prisoner, they found that one was a letter to the man's wife and the second was a suggestive message to another women. But the letters had been put into the wrong envelopes. The intelligence officials didn't know whether the man had goofed or the communists were testing to see whether the mail was opened in the U.S. It's unclear whether the Pentagon sent the letters to their proper reciepients, or, more likely, kept their operation secret by allowing the embarrassing mistake to occur, leaving the prisoner with some tough questions to answer when he returned home.

    Frank Sinatra plays Major Ben Marco, who has chronic nightmares about Sergeant Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) killing members of their unit after they were POWs during the Korean War. Turns out, they were both brainwashed by scientists from Manchuria in an experiment that directly involves Raymond, and then his (publicly) anti-communist mother(unforgettably played by Angela Lansbury) who is pushing her indecisive Senator husband Iselin, played by James Gregory, to make a name for himself by publicly naming 57 communists in the government. All are involved in an assassination plot that will shatter their lives, and affect the country forever... Brilliant conspiracy theory film is supremely well directed by John Frankenheimer, as are the performances of the whole cast, with an inspired & daring plot with many twists and turns, and is also deeply subversive for both sides(left & right) that still makes it relevant today, and remains profoundly cynical about politicians and politics, making it a truly classic, prescient thriller.

    Excellent movie overall. One glaring flaw; the scene in which Raymond kills the senator and his wife with a silencer on a revolver is ridiculous. Anyone who knows anything about weapons knows that a silencer will NOT work on a revolver, only semi-automatic weapons. Silencer on revolver will do no good in that the noise is released due to revolver design. This I believe is the first time I've seen this really bad mistake in a movie of this importance. This is the second time I have submitted this fact and it as yet has not made it to publication. I hope this glaring discrepancy is corrected this time and it will not be necessary to repeat this.

    I had expected 'The Manchurian Candidate' to be a political thriller but it turned out to be much more than. The element of psychology is very crucial here and the plot is quite clever despite being far-fetched at times (an example being the Communists leaving their plan of world domination in the hands of an uncontrolled soldier). The key idea, derived from of Pavlov's experiments is quite inventive and the way the story unfolds, leaves the viewer in suspense. 'The MC' also touches on various other themes such as incest, which are cleverly weaved into the story. The tension is exceptionally well built. The nightmare sequences, the scenes between Raymond and his mother and between Raymond and Marco are among the highlights. The cinematography is also noteworthy especially in the interaction sequences. The cast is very good. Frank Sinatra is brilliant but this is more Laurence Harvey's film and he does a smoothe job of playing a complex figure who is arrogant and self-centered, loving and guilt ridden and a cold blooded killer. Janet Leigh has a brief part which is done quite adequately and with some class but, in my opinion, it's Angela Lansbury who transcends as the power-hungry, conniving, manipulative and obsessive mother. I had never seen her in a negative role. simply put, she's mindblowing. 'The Manchurian Candidate' is dark, clever, chilling and, to an extent, even ahead of its time. It's one of the finest thrillers that have stood the test of time.

    Brainwashing is a goofy premise for a movie, but The Manchurian Candidate is so good, alternately dark and funny, that it's forgivable. The film walks a fine line between silly and serious. The villains, an empty- headed McCarthy-like senator and his conniving wife, are caricatures, far too exaggerated to work as satire, but Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey's performances as damaged ex-soldiers are played perfectly straight and with deep respect for the subject matter. This is a creative and sometimes heartbreaking thriller, if not a particularly thought-provoking one. Character actor John McGiver, recognizable from bit roles in movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Midnight Cowboy, excels as an affable patrician senator.

    There are simply not enough letters in the Summary to cover what this movie achieves. Angela Lansbury, in an interview on the DVD, says that everyone (all the actors) has at least one great scene in the movie. I would go a bit further than that and say everyone has great scenes...all of them. That is near to impossible to do, but John Frankenhemier did it. Quick Note: If you are watching on the DVD, absolutely DO NOT watch the interviews or specials before watching the movie; they are filled with spoilers! This is considered by many to be Frank Sinatra's best movie; I agree. I'm not a fan of Frank, but he gives a very deep and believable performance in this picture. He also was instrumental behind the scenes in getting the picture made. John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988). Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie.

    Excellent movie overall. One glaring flaw; the scene in which Raymond kills the senator and his wife with a silencer on a revolver is ridiculous. Anyone who knows anything about weapons knows that a silencer will NOT work on a revolver, only semi-automatic weapons. Silencer on revolver will do no good in that the noise is released due to revolver design. This I believe is the first time I've seen this really bad mistake in a movie of this importance. This is the second time I have submitted this fact and it as yet has not made it to publication. I hope this glaring discrepancy is corrected this time and it will not be necessary to repeat this.

    I had expected 'The Manchurian Candidate' to be a political thriller but it turned out to be much more than. The element of psychology is very crucial here and the plot is quite clever despite being far-fetched at times (an example being the Communists leaving their plan of world domination in the hands of an uncontrolled soldier). The key idea, derived from of Pavlov's experiments is quite inventive and the way the story unfolds, leaves the viewer in suspense. 'The MC' also touches on various other themes such as incest, which are cleverly weaved into the story. The tension is exceptionally well built. The nightmare sequences, the scenes between Raymond and his mother and between Raymond and Marco are among the highlights. The cinematography is also noteworthy especially in the interaction sequences. The cast is very good. Frank Sinatra is brilliant but this is more Laurence Harvey's film and he does a smoothe job of playing a complex figure who is arrogant and self-centered, loving and guilt ridden and a cold blooded killer. Janet Leigh has a brief part which is done quite adequately and with some class but, in my opinion, it's Angela Lansbury who transcends as the power-hungry, conniving, manipulative and obsessive mother. I had never seen her in a negative role. simply put, she's mindblowing. 'The Manchurian Candidate' is dark, clever, chilling and, to an extent, even ahead of its time. It's one of the finest thrillers that have stood the test of time.

    Brainwashing is a goofy premise for a movie, but The Manchurian Candidate is so good, alternately dark and funny, that it's forgivable. The film walks a fine line between silly and serious. The villains, an empty- headed McCarthy-like senator and his conniving wife, are caricatures, far too exaggerated to work as satire, but Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey's performances as damaged ex-soldiers are played perfectly straight and with deep respect for the subject matter. This is a creative and sometimes heartbreaking thriller, if not a particularly thought-provoking one. Character actor John McGiver, recognizable from bit roles in movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Midnight Cowboy, excels as an affable patrician senator.

    There are simply not enough letters in the Summary to cover what this movie achieves. Angela Lansbury, in an interview on the DVD, says that everyone (all the actors) has at least one great scene in the movie. I would go a bit further than that and say everyone has great scenes...all of them. That is near to impossible to do, but John Frankenhemier did it. Quick Note: If you are watching on the DVD, absolutely DO NOT watch the interviews or specials before watching the movie; they are filled with spoilers! This is considered by many to be Frank Sinatra's best movie; I agree. I'm not a fan of Frank, but he gives a very deep and believable performance in this picture. He also was instrumental behind the scenes in getting the picture made. John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988). Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie. The suspense and tension, maintained throughout, come from several sources, but chief among them is that very little is explained before it happens. In many ways, you learn at the same time as the characters. And yes, there is a twist in the climax, so don't blink. Just an excellent movie.

    I have seen this movie several times since it first came out. I now realize it stinks. The only thing I liked was the "portal" into the world of 50 years ago. Otherwise the plot doesn't hang together at all. First, we're supposed to believe that it is somehow "the Right" who are the Communists. No doubt this was due to the media's acceptance at the time of the anti-anti-Communist stance. By this viewpoint the anti-Communists were the "real Communists". The real-real Communists--the Soviets, Chinese, Cubans, etc.--were misunderstood builders of paradise. The "real Communists" were buffoons like James Gregory's character who make up conspiracies as easily as Heinz makes ketchup. Gregory's character is clearly based on Joe McCarthy and the movie repeats the media trope that he just pulled the number of commies (in the State Department, not Defense) out of thin air (Heinz' 57 for 57 Communists). Second, we are to asked to believe the Communists, clever enough to program human beings, would be so clumsy as to place one of their human robot assassins close to the very person they are trying to get installed as President? Seems unlikely especially considering that when Laurance Harvey kills John McGiver, he is in a zombie like state and thus not too attentive to whether he might be leaving evidence to connect him with the crime?

    The Manchurian Candidate, released in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis is frequently offered up as a symbol of Cold War paranoia: the war has come home, and even an all-American war hero could be a secret assassin. But at the same time it's a surreal satire on that paranoia, from the memorable juxtaposition of a genteel garden party and a Communist war council to the absurd terms of the hypnosis to the bumbling ineptness of the film's McCarthy stand-in. At the same time it's a Freudian drama revolving around a repressed, frigid son and a controlling mother. In weaving together the political and the psychoanalytical inside the generic conventions of the spy genre The Manchurian Candidate turns out to be a better Hitchcock movie than anything Hitch ever directed. The film never lags, but it takes its time establishing its characters and their motivations, as well as the web of political tension underlying everything. It's willing to spend twenty minutes moving plot pieces around, and those twenty minutes will go by like five. The performances of Laurence Harvey and Angela Landsbury as Raymond Shaw and his mother anchor the film and make it both human and profoundly cold. (Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns. Beyond a couple of clunky plot contrivances and the usual Freudian misogyny, The Manchurian Candidate is a remarkable film that works as both a genre piece and as a social commentary. Like Dr. Strangelove (with which it would make an excellent double bill), it both emblematizes the height of Cold War paranoia and skewers it. Classic film buffs will already be well acquainted with it, but even for those who usually steer clear of anything black and white, it's well worth watching.

    The Manchurian Candidate's pace is very tasteful and gentle; it keeps you on the edge and then spins you out of sync when some unforeseen and probably unexplainable scenes pop up, but then the events pull you back in, in a most masterful and surreal way as you wait to see all the events matchup. The Manchurian Candidate is a mix of suspense, thriller and the dialogues are very intense and to some, it could be seen to possess some dark humor. The unveiling of the mastermind behind the whole plot in the movie, or better still the mastermind behind the control of Raymond Shaw makes you the viewer raise an eye lid of the depth many will go for power. The movies conspiracy theory and mix of some kind of Sci-Fi in the whole brainwashing and mind control aspect of the film, makes The Manchurian Candidate more appealing to a variety of audience. The plot is about a squad in the Korean War, where the Major, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and his Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), returned home to be well received and Shaw even got a medal of honor for his exploits of saving his squad during the war. As Shaw grew to be in the public eye driven by his ever bearing mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury), Marco starts having recurring nightmares, where he sees Shaw kill two of his squad members and the nightmare led him to believe that the whole story he knows to have happened in Korea may not be real. John Frankenheimer the director and also the producer did a fine job on the screenplay based on a Richard Condon's 1959 novel of the same name, both film and novel are about the cold war and the acting by star actor and musician Frank Sinatra is one that needs to be seen. Angela Lansbury (Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971) who plays the role of the mother of Raymond Shaw got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for her wonderful portrayal of Mrs Iselin. The Manchurian Candidate was both a critical and financial success one that many should see, including you. Every moment you spend watching this film you will love and remember. The suspense keeps you glued. A remake of this 1962 classic was done by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner of Best Director for the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and the critical acclaimed Philadelphia in 1993 also starring Denzel Washington) in 2004, and it starred Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, it was a critical success but not much of a box office success like it's 1962 predecessor. www.lagsreviews.com

    Few things are as disappointing as watching a "classic" film you've heard so many wonderful things about which doesn't end up matching the hype. The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone. The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fianc&eacute;e to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained. Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong. Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that "shocking" end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them. There's a great story in this film someplace. But the film doesn't do that story justice.

    It turns out China really did send back "Manchurian Candidates" after the Korean War, but a less sophisticated kind than in the movie: http://www.koreanconfidential.com/manchuriancandidatesreport.html KorCon recently told you about a Top Secret program to monitor, and sometimes hold back, pro-communist letters from US POWs in Korea. U.S. intelligence secretly opened letters sent by U.S. POWs to their families. If the letters contained communist propaganda or suspected secret messages, they were not delivered. We ran across an interesting twist in those previously classified Pentagon records, which show the letter-opening project ran into at least one delicate situation. When intelligence officials opened two letters from a U.S. prisoner, they found that one was a letter to the man's wife and the second was a suggestive message to another women. But the letters had been put into the wrong envelopes. The intelligence officials didn't know whether the man had goofed or the communists were testing to see whether the mail was opened in the U.S. It's unclear whether the Pentagon sent the letters to their proper reciepients, or, more likely, kept their operation secret by allowing the embarrassing mistake to occur, leaving the prisoner with some tough questions to answer when he returned home.

    Frank Sinatra plays Major Ben Marco, who has chronic nightmares about Sergeant Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) killing members of their unit after they were POWs during the Korean War. Turns out, they were both brainwashed by scientists from Manchuria in an experiment that directly involves Raymond, and then his (publicly) anti-communist mother(unforgettably played by Angela Lansbury) who is pushing her indecisive Senator husband Iselin, played by James Gregory, to make a name for himself by publicly naming 57 communists in the government. All are involved in an assassination plot that will shatter their lives, and affect the country forever... Brilliant conspiracy theory film is supremely well directed by John Frankenheimer, as are the performances of the whole cast, with an inspired & daring plot with many twists and turns, and is also deeply subversive for both sides(left & right) that still makes it relevant today, and remains profoundly cynical about politicians and politics, making it a truly classic, prescient thriller.

Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fianc&eacute;e to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained. Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong. Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that "shocking" end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them. There's a great story in this film someplace. But the film doesn't do that story justice.

    It turns out China really did send back "Manchurian Candidates" after the Korean War, but a less sophisticated kind than in the movie: http://www.koreanconfidential.com/manchuriancandidatesreport.html KorCon recently told you about a Top Secret program to monitor, and sometimes hold back, pro-communist letters from US POWs in Korea. U.S. intelligence secretly opened letters sent by U.S. POWs to their families. If the letters contained communist propaganda or suspected secret messages, they were not delivered. We ran across an interesting twist in those previously classified Pentagon records, which show the letter-opening project ran into at least one delicate situation. When intelligence officials opened two letters from a U.S. prisoner, they found that one was a letter to the man's wife and the second was a suggestive message to another women. But the letters had been put into the wrong envelopes. The intelligence officials didn't know whether the man had goofed or the communists were testing to see whether the mail was opened in the U.S. It's unclear whether the Pentagon sent the letters to their proper reciepients, or, more likely, kept their operation secret by allowing the embarrassing mistake to occur, leaving the prisoner with some tough questions to answer when he returned home.

    Frank Sinatra plays Major Ben Marco, who has chronic nightmares about Sergeant Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) killing members of their unit after they were POWs during the Korean War. Turns out, they were both brainwashed by scientists from Manchuria in an experiment that directly involves Raymond, and then his (publicly) anti-communist mother(unforgettably played by Angela Lansbury) who is pushing her indecisive Senator husband Iselin, played by James Gregory, to make a name for himself by publicly naming 57 communists in the government. All are involved in an assassination plot that will shatter their lives, and affect the country forever... Brilliant conspiracy theory film is supremely well directed by John Frankenheimer, as are the performances of the whole cast, with an inspired & daring plot with many twists and turns, and is also deeply subversive for both sides(left & right) that still makes it relevant today, and remains profoundly cynical about politicians and politics, making it a truly classic, prescient thriller.

    Excellent movie overall. One glaring flaw; the scene in which Raymond kills the senator and his wife with a silencer on a revolver is ridiculous. Anyone who knows anything about weapons knows that a silencer will NOT work on a revolver, only semi-automatic weapons. Silencer on revolver will do no good in that the noise is released due to revolver design. This I believe is the first time I've seen this really bad mistake in a movie of this importance. This is the second time I have submitted this fact and it as yet has not made it to publication. I hope this glaring discrepancy is corrected this time and it will not be necessary to repeat this.

    I had expected 'The Manchurian Candidate' to be a political thriller but it turned out to be much more than. The element of psychology is very crucial here and the plot is quite clever despite being far-fetched at times (an example being the Communists leaving their plan of world domination in the hands of an uncontrolled soldier). The key idea, derived from of Pavlov's experiments is quite inventive and the way the story unfolds, leaves the viewer in suspense. 'The MC' also touches on various other themes such as incest, which are cleverly weaved into the story. The tension is exceptionally well built. The nightmare sequences, the scenes between Raymond and his mother and between Raymond and Marco are among the highlights. The cinematography is also noteworthy especially in the interaction sequences. The cast is very good. Frank Sinatra is brilliant but this is more Laurence Harvey's film and he does a smoothe job of playing a complex figure who is arrogant and self-centered, loving and guilt ridden and a cold blooded killer. Janet Leigh has a brief part which is done quite adequately and with some class but, in my opinion, it's Angela Lansbury who transcends as the power-hungry, conniving, manipulative and obsessive mother. I had never seen her in a negative role. simply put, she's mindblowing. 'The Manchurian Candidate' is dark, clever, chilling and, to an extent, even ahead of its time. It's one of the finest thrillers that have stood the test of time.

    Brainwashing is a goofy premise for a movie, but The Manchurian Candidate is so good, alternately dark and funny, that it's forgivable. The film walks a fine line between silly and serious. The villains, an empty- headed McCarthy-like senator and his conniving wife, are caricatures, far too exaggerated to work as satire, but Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey's performances as damaged ex-soldiers are played perfectly straight and with deep respect for the subject matter. This is a creative and sometimes heartbreaking thriller, if not a particularly thought-provoking one. Character actor John McGiver, recognizable from bit roles in movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Midnight Cowboy, excels as an affable patrician senator.

    There are simply not enough letters in the Summary to cover what this movie achieves. Angela Lansbury, in an interview on the DVD, says that everyone (all the actors) has at least one great scene in the movie. I would go a bit further than that and say everyone has great scenes...all of them. That is near to impossible to do, but John Frankenhemier did it. Quick Note: If you are watching on the DVD, absolutely DO NOT watch the interviews or specials before watching the movie; they are filled with spoilers! This is considered by many to be Frank Sinatra's best movie; I agree. I'm not a fan of Frank, but he gives a very deep and believable performance in this picture. He also was instrumental behind the scenes in getting the picture made. John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988). Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie. The suspense and tension, maintained throughout, come from several sources, but chief among them is that very little is explained before it happens. In many ways, you learn at the same time as the characters. And yes, there is a twist in the climax, so don't blink. Just an excellent movie.

    I have seen this movie several times since it first came out. I now realize it stinks. The only thing I liked was the "portal" into the world of 50 years ago. Otherwise the plot doesn't hang together at all. First, we're supposed to believe that it is somehow "the Right" who are the Communists. No doubt this was due to the media's acceptance at the time of the anti-anti-Communist stance. By this viewpoint the anti-Communists were the "real Communists". The real-real Communists--the Soviets, Chinese, Cubans, etc.--were misunderstood builders of paradise. The "real Communists" were buffoons like James Gregory's character who make up conspiracies as easily as Heinz makes ketchup. Gregory's character is clearly based on Joe McCarthy and the movie repeats the media trope that he just pulled the number of commies (in the State Department, not Defense) out of thin air (Heinz' 57 for 57 Communists). Second, we are to asked to believe the Communists, clever enough to program human beings, would be so clumsy as to place one of their human robot assassins close to the very person they are trying to get installed as President? Seems unlikely especially considering that when Laurance Harvey kills John McGiver, he is in a zombie like state and thus not too attentive to whether he might be leaving evidence to connect him with the crime?

    The Manchurian Candidate, released in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis is frequently offered up as a symbol of Cold War paranoia: the war has come home, and even an all-American war hero could be a secret assassin. But at the same time it's a surreal satire on that paranoia, from the memorable juxtaposition of a genteel garden party and a Communist war council to the absurd terms of the hypnosis to the bumbling ineptness of the film's McCarthy stand-in. At the same time it's a Freudian drama revolving around a repressed, frigid son and a controlling mother. In weaving together the political and the psychoanalytical inside the generic conventions of the spy genre The Manchurian Candidate turns out to be a better Hitchcock movie than anything Hitch ever directed. The film never lags, but it takes its time establishing its characters and their motivations, as well as the web of political tension underlying everything. It's willing to spend twenty minutes moving plot pieces around, and those twenty minutes will go by like five. The performances of Laurence Harvey and Angela Landsbury as Raymond Shaw and his mother anchor the film and make it both human and profoundly cold. (Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns. Beyond a couple of clunky plot contrivances and the usual Freudian misogyny, The Manchurian Candidate is a remarkable film that works as both a genre piece and as a social commentary. Like Dr. Strangelove (with which it would make an excellent double bill), it both emblematizes the height of Cold War paranoia and skewers it. Classic film buffs will already be well acquainted with it, but even for those who usually steer clear of anything black and white, it's well worth watching.

    The Manchurian Candidate's pace is very tasteful and gentle; it keeps you on the edge and then spins you out of sync when some unforeseen and probably unexplainable scenes pop up, but then the events pull you back in, in a most masterful and surreal way as you wait to see all the events matchup. The Manchurian Candidate is a mix of suspense, thriller and the dialogues are very intense and to some, it could be seen to possess some dark humor. The unveiling of the mastermind behind the whole plot in the movie, or better still the mastermind behind the control of Raymond Shaw makes you the viewer raise an eye lid of the depth many will go for power. The movies conspiracy theory and mix of some kind of Sci-Fi in the whole brainwashing and mind control aspect of the film, makes The Manchurian Candidate more appealing to a variety of audience. The plot is about a squad in the Korean War, where the Major, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and his Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), returned home to be well received and Shaw even got a medal of honor for his exploits of saving his squad during the war. As Shaw grew to be in the public eye driven by his ever bearing mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury), Marco starts having recurring nightmares, where he sees Shaw kill two of his squad members and the nightmare led him to believe that the whole story he knows to have happened in Korea may not be real. John Frankenheimer the director and also the producer did a fine job on the screenplay based on a Richard Condon's 1959 novel of the same name, both film and novel are about the cold war and the acting by star actor and musician Frank Sinatra is one that needs to be seen. Angela Lansbury (Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971) who plays the role of the mother of Raymond Shaw got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for her wonderful portrayal of Mrs Iselin. The Manchurian Candidate was both a critical and financial success one that many should see, including you. Every moment you spend watching this film you will love and remember. The suspense keeps you glued. A remake of this 1962 classic was done by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner of Best Director for the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and the critical acclaimed Philadelphia in 1993 also starring Denzel Washington) in 2004, and it starred Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, it was a critical success but not much of a box office success like it's 1962 predecessor. www.lagsreviews.com

    Few things are as disappointing as watching a "classic" film you've heard so many wonderful things about which doesn't end up matching the hype. The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone. The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fianc&eacute;e to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained. Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan?

(Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns. Beyond a couple of clunky plot contrivances and the usual Freudian misogyny, The Manchurian Candidate is a remarkable film that works as both a genre piece and as a social commentary. Like Dr. Strangelove (with which it would make an excellent double bill), it both emblematizes the height of Cold War paranoia and skewers it. Classic film buffs will already be well acquainted with it, but even for those who usually steer clear of anything black and white, it's well worth watching.

    The Manchurian Candidate's pace is very tasteful and gentle; it keeps you on the edge and then spins you out of sync when some unforeseen and probably unexplainable scenes pop up, but then the events pull you back in, in a most masterful and surreal way as you wait to see all the events matchup. The Manchurian Candidate is a mix of suspense, thriller and the dialogues are very intense and to some, it could be seen to possess some dark humor. The unveiling of the mastermind behind the whole plot in the movie, or better still the mastermind behind the control of Raymond Shaw makes you the viewer raise an eye lid of the depth many will go for power. The movies conspiracy theory and mix of some kind of Sci-Fi in the whole brainwashing and mind control aspect of the film, makes The Manchurian Candidate more appealing to a variety of audience. The plot is about a squad in the Korean War, where the Major, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and his Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), returned home to be well received and Shaw even got a medal of honor for his exploits of saving his squad during the war. As Shaw grew to be in the public eye driven by his ever bearing mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury), Marco starts having recurring nightmares, where he sees Shaw kill two of his squad members and the nightmare led him to believe that the whole story he knows to have happened in Korea may not be real. John Frankenheimer the director and also the producer did a fine job on the screenplay based on a Richard Condon's 1959 novel of the same name, both film and novel are about the cold war and the acting by star actor and musician Frank Sinatra is one that needs to be seen. Angela Lansbury (Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971) who plays the role of the mother of Raymond Shaw got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for her wonderful portrayal of Mrs Iselin. The Manchurian Candidate was both a critical and financial success one that many should see, including you. Every moment you spend watching this film you will love and remember. The suspense keeps you glued. A remake of this 1962 classic was done by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner of Best Director for the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and the critical acclaimed Philadelphia in 1993 also starring Denzel Washington) in 2004, and it starred Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, it was a critical success but not much of a box office success like it's 1962 predecessor. www.lagsreviews.com

    Few things are as disappointing as watching a "classic" film you've heard so many wonderful things about which doesn't end up matching the hype. The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone. The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fianc&eacute;e to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained. Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong. Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that "shocking" end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them. There's a great story in this film someplace. But the film doesn't do that story justice.

    It turns out China really did send back "Manchurian Candidates" after the Korean War, but a less sophisticated kind than in the movie: http://www.koreanconfidential.com/manchuriancandidatesreport.html KorCon recently told you about a Top Secret program to monitor, and sometimes hold back, pro-communist letters from US POWs in Korea. U.S. intelligence secretly opened letters sent by U.S. POWs to their families. If the letters contained communist propaganda or suspected secret messages, they were not delivered. We ran across an interesting twist in those previously classified Pentagon records, which show the letter-opening project ran into at least one delicate situation. When intelligence officials opened two letters from a U.S. prisoner, they found that one was a letter to the man's wife and the second was a suggestive message to another women. But the letters had been put into the wrong envelopes. The intelligence officials didn't know whether the man had goofed or the communists were testing to see whether the mail was opened in the U.S. It's unclear whether the Pentagon sent the letters to their proper reciepients, or, more likely, kept their operation secret by allowing the embarrassing mistake to occur, leaving the prisoner with some tough questions to answer when he returned home.

    Frank Sinatra plays Major Ben Marco, who has chronic nightmares about Sergeant Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) killing members of their unit after they were POWs during the Korean War. Turns out, they were both brainwashed by scientists from Manchuria in an experiment that directly involves Raymond, and then his (publicly) anti-communist mother(unforgettably played by Angela Lansbury) who is pushing her indecisive Senator husband Iselin, played by James Gregory, to make a name for himself by publicly naming 57 communists in the government. All are involved in an assassination plot that will shatter their lives, and affect the country forever... Brilliant conspiracy theory film is supremely well directed by John Frankenheimer, as are the performances of the whole cast, with an inspired & daring plot with many twists and turns, and is also deeply subversive for both sides(left & right) that still makes it relevant today, and remains profoundly cynical about politicians and politics, making it a truly classic, prescient thriller.

    Excellent movie overall. One glaring flaw; the scene in which Raymond kills the senator and his wife with a silencer on a revolver is ridiculous. Anyone who knows anything about weapons knows that a silencer will NOT work on a revolver, only semi-automatic weapons. Silencer on revolver will do no good in that the noise is released due to revolver design. This I believe is the first time I've seen this really bad mistake in a movie of this importance. This is the second time I have submitted this fact and it as yet has not made it to publication. I hope this glaring discrepancy is corrected this time and it will not be necessary to repeat this.

    I had expected 'The Manchurian Candidate' to be a political thriller but it turned out to be much more than. The element of psychology is very crucial here and the plot is quite clever despite being far-fetched at times (an example being the Communists leaving their plan of world domination in the hands of an uncontrolled soldier). The key idea, derived from of Pavlov's experiments is quite inventive and the way the story unfolds, leaves the viewer in suspense. 'The MC' also touches on various other themes such as incest, which are cleverly weaved into the story. The tension is exceptionally well built. The nightmare sequences, the scenes between Raymond and his mother and between Raymond and Marco are among the highlights. The cinematography is also noteworthy especially in the interaction sequences. The cast is very good. Frank Sinatra is brilliant but this is more Laurence Harvey's film and he does a smoothe job of playing a complex figure who is arrogant and self-centered, loving and guilt ridden and a cold blooded killer. Janet Leigh has a brief part which is done quite adequately and with some class but, in my opinion, it's Angela Lansbury who transcends as the power-hungry, conniving, manipulative and obsessive mother. I had never seen her in a negative role. simply put, she's mindblowing. 'The Manchurian Candidate' is dark, clever, chilling and, to an extent, even ahead of its time. It's one of the finest thrillers that have stood the test of time.

    Brainwashing is a goofy premise for a movie, but The Manchurian Candidate is so good, alternately dark and funny, that it's forgivable. The film walks a fine line between silly and serious. The villains, an empty- headed McCarthy-like senator and his conniving wife, are caricatures, far too exaggerated to work as satire, but Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey's performances as damaged ex-soldiers are played perfectly straight and with deep respect for the subject matter. This is a creative and sometimes heartbreaking thriller, if not a particularly thought-provoking one. Character actor John McGiver, recognizable from bit roles in movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Midnight Cowboy, excels as an affable patrician senator.

    There are simply not enough letters in the Summary to cover what this movie achieves. Angela Lansbury, in an interview on the DVD, says that everyone (all the actors) has at least one great scene in the movie. I would go a bit further than that and say everyone has great scenes...all of them. That is near to impossible to do, but John Frankenhemier did it. Quick Note: If you are watching on the DVD, absolutely DO NOT watch the interviews or specials before watching the movie; they are filled with spoilers! This is considered by many to be Frank Sinatra's best movie; I agree. I'm not a fan of Frank, but he gives a very deep and believable performance in this picture. He also was instrumental behind the scenes in getting the picture made. John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988). Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie. The suspense and tension, maintained throughout, come from several sources, but chief among them is that very little is explained before it happens. In many ways, you learn at the same time as the characters. And yes, there is a twist in the climax, so don't blink. Just an excellent movie.

    I have seen this movie several times since it first came out. I now realize it stinks. The only thing I liked was the "portal" into the world of 50 years ago. Otherwise the plot doesn't hang together at all. First, we're supposed to believe that it is somehow "the Right" who are the Communists. No doubt this was due to the media's acceptance at the time of the anti-anti-Communist stance. By this viewpoint the anti-Communists were the "real Communists". The real-real Communists--the Soviets, Chinese, Cubans, etc.--were misunderstood builders of paradise. The "real Communists" were buffoons like James Gregory's character who make up conspiracies as easily as Heinz makes ketchup. Gregory's character is clearly based on Joe McCarthy and the movie repeats the media trope that he just pulled the number of commies (in the State Department, not Defense) out of thin air (Heinz' 57 for 57 Communists). Second, we are to asked to believe the Communists, clever enough to program human beings, would be so clumsy as to place one of their human robot assassins close to the very person they are trying to get installed as President? Seems unlikely especially considering that when Laurance Harvey kills John McGiver, he is in a zombie like state and thus not too attentive to whether he might be leaving evidence to connect him with the crime?

    The Manchurian Candidate, released in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis is frequently offered up as a symbol of Cold War paranoia: the war has come home, and even an all-American war hero could be a secret assassin. But at the same time it's a surreal satire on that paranoia, from the memorable juxtaposition of a genteel garden party and a Communist war council to the absurd terms of the hypnosis to the bumbling ineptness of the film's McCarthy stand-in. At the same time it's a Freudian drama revolving around a repressed, frigid son and a controlling mother. In weaving together the political and the psychoanalytical inside the generic conventions of the spy genre The Manchurian Candidate turns out to be a better Hitchcock movie than anything Hitch ever directed. The film never lags, but it takes its time establishing its characters and their motivations, as well as the web of political tension underlying everything. It's willing to spend twenty minutes moving plot pieces around, and those twenty minutes will go by like five. The performances of Laurence Harvey and Angela Landsbury as Raymond Shaw and his mother anchor the film and make it both human and profoundly cold. (Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns.
