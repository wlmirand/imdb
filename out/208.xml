    Young Frankenstein is a fantastic film with a very fun and cleverly parodied spoof of classic Frankenstein films that is directed very impressively by Mel Brooks and is a pitch perfect resemblance of how those films actually looked.The cast is very inspired and all play really funny and unique characters,obviously the best performance is from the great Gene Wilder,this man just knows how to act,but in a serious and comedic way,and the other cast members all do a great job as well,the two that really stand out for me are Peter Boyle and Gene Hackman's cameo.I don't think it's Mel Brooks or Gene Wilder's best film,but all fans of classic comedy will really appreciate it,and fans of classic monster films will appreciate its very impressive parody. Dr Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is assigned to recreate his grandfathers well known experiment,something he has being trying to avoid for many years.

    Spoofs ate ten a penny these days but Young Frankenstein had so much care and attention put in by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, making it fresh and innovative. What works is the atmosphere, filmed in Black and White and evoking the sets, location of the Universal 1930's Frankenstein films you are easily brought in to the atmosphere which get regularly punctures with jokes, one liners and visual jokes such as the enormous knockers on the door as they arrive at the castle. The cast of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Khan, Cloris Leachman, Terri Garr milk the laughs for all its worth. Gene Hackman is a hoot as the blind hermit which sends to monster scurrying after he offers cigars. Feldman's Igor is the best and both Kahn and Garr are sensual and sexy. After almost 40 years, its still mad and funny.

    In his heyday, Mel Brooks was the most skilled specialist in parody films. He tackled all manner of genres but Young Frankenstein is possibly his best. In this one the target was 1930's Universal horror movies, or more specifically the 'Frankenstein' films. What makes this one work so well is that, aside from Brooks' typical crazed humour; there is a real attempt to capture the look and feel of those old movies it is satirizing. The sumptuous black and white photography and the elaborate sets all recall the Universal 'Frankenstein' outings. And overall there is an unmistakable loving care at work. Brooks is definitely respectful of the films he is parodying and this ensures that they have not only the laughs but a fine attention to detail. Quite a few of the funniest moments require audience familiarity with the source movies, so Young Frankenstein is not simply pandering to easy laughs but working in specific references as well. The other thing that really helps massively is the cast. Gene Wilder is undoubtedly the star of the show as the title character. This film really shows why he remains one of the funniest cinema actors of all time. Peter Boyle's portrayal of the monster is a good rival to Boris Karloff's original but with great comic timing  his performance of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' is inspired hilarity. While Gene Hackman is hilarious as the blind hermit, his scene with Boyle is comic gold from start to finish and is one of the undoubted highlights of the movie. To be fair, like all Brooks movies, this is still somewhat uneven in bits. Some of the humour doesn't really work so well. Marty Feldman, for example, looks really funny but his comic delivery is pretty poor. But in the main, the jokes still work more than they do not. On the whole it's a great looking, funny film.

    It helps immensely to not only be familiar with the Universal Frankenstein Series, but to know them implicitly. Because much of the best humor here is derived from direct parody of certain famous scenes. This is typical Mel Brooks with its broad and lewd fixation on Sex and Human Sexuality, but these don't work the best in this Film. But, it is consistently funny with some clever slapstick and wordplay. Some of it is quite refreshingly inventive ("Abbey Normal") and Cloris Leachman's deadpan mugging. The Hunchback (what hunch?) Igor (pronounced eye-gore) also is a field day for Marty Feldman. Add to this the spot on mimicry of the one armed Captain from the Son of' Movie, and the inspired Peter Boyle's Creature, it all sums up for a great looking love-fest from Brooks and company. The one drawback is the relentless screaming of lines, when they would have been even more effective delivered a bit more restrained. But when Gene Wilder isn't shouting he is rather amusing wavering between straight faced Satire and unhinged psychopathy.

    This movie is just so funny I couldn't stop laughing. This might be Mel Brook's funniest movie including Blazing Saddles, which was super funny in it's own right. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, and Teri Garr are just fantastic in this movie. Teri Garr is the sexiest I have ever seen her, including the movie where she showed skin.The outset of the movie has Gene refusing his heritage as a Frankenstein. He eventually goes to his ancestral castle and Cloris Leachman, the house keeper and old Frankentein's lover as it turns out, lures him to the old laboratory used by his ancestor. He goes through the usual procedures and creates a monster (?) played very well by Peter Boyd (RIP). Kenneth Mars plays an excellent inspector Kemp and I love his fake hand. The ending where Gene and Peter swap some of their brains and, as it turns out body parts is just too funny. I like Madelaine Kahn is good as the uptight I want it my way until she hooks up with the monster is a nice touch.

    had absolutely no clue what to expect from this film as no one prepared me for the insane hilarity with such subtle surprising humor... actually was quite upset that I waited over 20 years to watch this, and given how difficult it is to construct an homage comedy I was very impressed how easily I heartily laughed out loud appreciating the comedic genius of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder... many would debate the Putting on the Ritz routine as too out there but I found the scene most entertaining and a crowning achievement for our dear sweet crowd loving monster... quotable, memorable, brilliant, and most joyous, can highly recommend this for another 20 years minimum!

    Young Frankenstein is praised by many as one of the funniest movies in history. It is certainly a lovely movie, with great performances  mainly those of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman  and an interesting, modern remake of the original Mary Shelley novel. I particularly liked the fact that it's black and white  this helps greatly in creating the creepy and old-movie-like atmosphere. It's also quite funny, but I suggest you don't see it more than once because it might disappoint you after more viewings. The respectable doctor Frederik Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has tried for many years to cut the ties with his family, as his grandfather, the baron, had become famous for trying to reanimate dead bodies and in his opinion, his grandfather's work was crap. But after he arrives to the Transylvanian castle that belonged to his late grandfather, Frederik discovers his diary and decides to try and reanimate someone dead himself, as it appears his grandfather had succeeded. In this task, he is aided by Igor (Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr). As I said, the atmosphere in this movie is great: it's all black and white, and it features mostly night scenes in the creepy Transylvanian environment, with howling wolves and fog all around. This characteristic is also very well used in some jokes. Marty Feldman is amazing as Igor, and the character himself is so funny and strange, it's delightful to watch him. Gene Wilder does an incredible job in portraying Dr. Frankenstein, especially in his madness. Peter Boyle, even though he doesn't speak most of the time since he's the monster, is very good nonetheless. This movie is also a nice homage to the old Universal movies. Unfortunately, Young Frankenstein fails as a comedy. Not horribly, but still. Some of the jokes are repetitive and not very funny, although there are some truly amusing scenes. Also, some parts are slow and boring. But considering how horrible modern spoofs are, this movie really shouldn't be bashed. I would definitely recommend watching it, especially since the first time you might just find it hilarious. Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    - A- This is a very funny film as a comedy of the Frankenstein's monster story. The film has solid laughs throughout, a good lead, and a fun monster. The story is the basic story of Frankenstein and the monster getting loose but in the middle are some laughs like the maid, Igor's hump' and many more. Gene Wilder is wild as the scientist and does one of his best jobs in maybe his best film. The monster is cool at first and then at the end is quite funny with a fun twist to the take off. A very successful story that could turn into as much of a classic as the original horror is itself.

    This is a classic. No argument I've heard has changed that. HOWEVER, I am 100% convinced that the director, Mel Brooks, is not as present in this project as you would think. I am convinced that Brooks is not the source of this great film's humor! This is not an essay and I have no supporting work. But I do have a long history of watching Mel Brooks. I don't want to add much more but I am compelled to write by the blah blah to get more blah blah and add to the line of copblah copblay! Also b lah , and also blah So in conclusion chal blah and don't let the system own you. Be YOU.!! Tim a aq a

    Oh, where to begin. In my opinion, "Young Frankenstein" is one of the funniest movies ever made. From the first scene with Gene Wilder lecturing his class, to the "Abby Normal" sequence later on, this film is a joy to watch and will have have you smiling all the way through. After his grandfathers death, Dr. Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) begins experimenting with the idea of bringing dead humans back to life with the help of assistants Igor (pronounced Eye-gor) and Inga. From brief chuckles to bursts of hysterical laughter, this movie has it all. An interesting factoid is much of the equipment you see in the laboratory are original prop pieces used in the classic Boris Karloff film. Also note how the film was shot in purposely in black and white, despite the complaints from the studio. Later a Broadway musical written by director Mel Brooks.

Quite a few of the funniest moments require audience familiarity with the source movies, so Young Frankenstein is not simply pandering to easy laughs but working in specific references as well. The other thing that really helps massively is the cast. Gene Wilder is undoubtedly the star of the show as the title character. This film really shows why he remains one of the funniest cinema actors of all time. Peter Boyle's portrayal of the monster is a good rival to Boris Karloff's original but with great comic timing  his performance of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' is inspired hilarity. While Gene Hackman is hilarious as the blind hermit, his scene with Boyle is comic gold from start to finish and is one of the undoubted highlights of the movie. To be fair, like all Brooks movies, this is still somewhat uneven in bits. Some of the humour doesn't really work so well. Marty Feldman, for example, looks really funny but his comic delivery is pretty poor. But in the main, the jokes still work more than they do not. On the whole it's a great looking, funny film.

    It helps immensely to not only be familiar with the Universal Frankenstein Series, but to know them implicitly. Because much of the best humor here is derived from direct parody of certain famous scenes. This is typical Mel Brooks with its broad and lewd fixation on Sex and Human Sexuality, but these don't work the best in this Film. But, it is consistently funny with some clever slapstick and wordplay. Some of it is quite refreshingly inventive ("Abbey Normal") and Cloris Leachman's deadpan mugging. The Hunchback (what hunch?) Igor (pronounced eye-gore) also is a field day for Marty Feldman. Add to this the spot on mimicry of the one armed Captain from the Son of' Movie, and the inspired Peter Boyle's Creature, it all sums up for a great looking love-fest from Brooks and company. The one drawback is the relentless screaming of lines, when they would have been even more effective delivered a bit more restrained. But when Gene Wilder isn't shouting he is rather amusing wavering between straight faced Satire and unhinged psychopathy.

    This movie is just so funny I couldn't stop laughing. This might be Mel Brook's funniest movie including Blazing Saddles, which was super funny in it's own right. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, and Teri Garr are just fantastic in this movie. Teri Garr is the sexiest I have ever seen her, including the movie where she showed skin.The outset of the movie has Gene refusing his heritage as a Frankenstein. He eventually goes to his ancestral castle and Cloris Leachman, the house keeper and old Frankentein's lover as it turns out, lures him to the old laboratory used by his ancestor. He goes through the usual procedures and creates a monster (?) played very well by Peter Boyd (RIP). Kenneth Mars plays an excellent inspector Kemp and I love his fake hand. The ending where Gene and Peter swap some of their brains and, as it turns out body parts is just too funny. I like Madelaine Kahn is good as the uptight I want it my way until she hooks up with the monster is a nice touch.

    had absolutely no clue what to expect from this film as no one prepared me for the insane hilarity with such subtle surprising humor... actually was quite upset that I waited over 20 years to watch this, and given how difficult it is to construct an homage comedy I was very impressed how easily I heartily laughed out loud appreciating the comedic genius of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder... many would debate the Putting on the Ritz routine as too out there but I found the scene most entertaining and a crowning achievement for our dear sweet crowd loving monster... quotable, memorable, brilliant, and most joyous, can highly recommend this for another 20 years minimum!

    Young Frankenstein is praised by many as one of the funniest movies in history. It is certainly a lovely movie, with great performances  mainly those of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman  and an interesting, modern remake of the original Mary Shelley novel. I particularly liked the fact that it's black and white  this helps greatly in creating the creepy and old-movie-like atmosphere. It's also quite funny, but I suggest you don't see it more than once because it might disappoint you after more viewings. The respectable doctor Frederik Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has tried for many years to cut the ties with his family, as his grandfather, the baron, had become famous for trying to reanimate dead bodies and in his opinion, his grandfather's work was crap. But after he arrives to the Transylvanian castle that belonged to his late grandfather, Frederik discovers his diary and decides to try and reanimate someone dead himself, as it appears his grandfather had succeeded. In this task, he is aided by Igor (Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr). As I said, the atmosphere in this movie is great: it's all black and white, and it features mostly night scenes in the creepy Transylvanian environment, with howling wolves and fog all around. This characteristic is also very well used in some jokes. Marty Feldman is amazing as Igor, and the character himself is so funny and strange, it's delightful to watch him. Gene Wilder does an incredible job in portraying Dr. Frankenstein, especially in his madness. Peter Boyle, even though he doesn't speak most of the time since he's the monster, is very good nonetheless. This movie is also a nice homage to the old Universal movies. Unfortunately, Young Frankenstein fails as a comedy. Not horribly, but still. Some of the jokes are repetitive and not very funny, although there are some truly amusing scenes. Also, some parts are slow and boring. But considering how horrible modern spoofs are, this movie really shouldn't be bashed. I would definitely recommend watching it, especially since the first time you might just find it hilarious. Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    - A- This is a very funny film as a comedy of the Frankenstein's monster story. The film has solid laughs throughout, a good lead, and a fun monster. The story is the basic story of Frankenstein and the monster getting loose but in the middle are some laughs like the maid, Igor's hump' and many more. Gene Wilder is wild as the scientist and does one of his best jobs in maybe his best film. The monster is cool at first and then at the end is quite funny with a fun twist to the take off. A very successful story that could turn into as much of a classic as the original horror is itself.

    This is a classic. No argument I've heard has changed that. HOWEVER, I am 100% convinced that the director, Mel Brooks, is not as present in this project as you would think. I am convinced that Brooks is not the source of this great film's humor! This is not an essay and I have no supporting work. But I do have a long history of watching Mel Brooks. I don't want to add much more but I am compelled to write by the blah blah to get more blah blah and add to the line of copblah copblay! Also b lah , and also blah So in conclusion chal blah and don't let the system own you. Be YOU.!! Tim a aq a

    Oh, where to begin. In my opinion, "Young Frankenstein" is one of the funniest movies ever made. From the first scene with Gene Wilder lecturing his class, to the "Abby Normal" sequence later on, this film is a joy to watch and will have have you smiling all the way through. After his grandfathers death, Dr. Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) begins experimenting with the idea of bringing dead humans back to life with the help of assistants Igor (pronounced Eye-gor) and Inga. From brief chuckles to bursts of hysterical laughter, this movie has it all. An interesting factoid is much of the equipment you see in the laboratory are original prop pieces used in the classic Boris Karloff film. Also note how the film was shot in purposely in black and white, despite the complaints from the studio. Later a Broadway musical written by director Mel Brooks.

    Young Frankenstein is a fantastic film with a very fun and cleverly parodied spoof of classic Frankenstein films that is directed very impressively by Mel Brooks and is a pitch perfect resemblance of how those films actually looked.The cast is very inspired and all play really funny and unique characters,obviously the best performance is from the great Gene Wilder,this man just knows how to act,but in a serious and comedic way,and the other cast members all do a great job as well,the two that really stand out for me are Peter Boyle and Gene Hackman's cameo.I don't think it's Mel Brooks or Gene Wilder's best film,but all fans of classic comedy will really appreciate it,and fans of classic monster films will appreciate its very impressive parody. Dr Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is assigned to recreate his grandfathers well known experiment,something he has being trying to avoid for many years.

    Spoofs ate ten a penny these days but Young Frankenstein had so much care and attention put in by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, making it fresh and innovative. What works is the atmosphere, filmed in Black and White and evoking the sets, location of the Universal 1930's Frankenstein films you are easily brought in to the atmosphere which get regularly punctures with jokes, one liners and visual jokes such as the enormous knockers on the door as they arrive at the castle. The cast of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Khan, Cloris Leachman, Terri Garr milk the laughs for all its worth. Gene Hackman is a hoot as the blind hermit which sends to monster scurrying after he offers cigars. Feldman's Igor is the best and both Kahn and Garr are sensual and sexy. After almost 40 years, its still mad and funny.

    In his heyday, Mel Brooks was the most skilled specialist in parody films. He tackled all manner of genres but Young Frankenstein is possibly his best. In this one the target was 1930's Universal horror movies, or more specifically the 'Frankenstein' films. What makes this one work so well is that, aside from Brooks' typical crazed humour; there is a real attempt to capture the look and feel of those old movies it is satirizing. The sumptuous black and white photography and the elaborate sets all recall the Universal 'Frankenstein' outings. And overall there is an unmistakable loving care at work. Brooks is definitely respectful of the films he is parodying and this ensures that they have not only the laughs but a fine attention to detail. Quite a few of the funniest moments require audience familiarity with the source movies, so Young Frankenstein is not simply pandering to easy laughs but working in specific references as well.

It's also quite funny, but I suggest you don't see it more than once because it might disappoint you after more viewings. The respectable doctor Frederik Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has tried for many years to cut the ties with his family, as his grandfather, the baron, had become famous for trying to reanimate dead bodies and in his opinion, his grandfather's work was crap. But after he arrives to the Transylvanian castle that belonged to his late grandfather, Frederik discovers his diary and decides to try and reanimate someone dead himself, as it appears his grandfather had succeeded. In this task, he is aided by Igor (Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr). As I said, the atmosphere in this movie is great: it's all black and white, and it features mostly night scenes in the creepy Transylvanian environment, with howling wolves and fog all around. This characteristic is also very well used in some jokes. Marty Feldman is amazing as Igor, and the character himself is so funny and strange, it's delightful to watch him. Gene Wilder does an incredible job in portraying Dr. Frankenstein, especially in his madness. Peter Boyle, even though he doesn't speak most of the time since he's the monster, is very good nonetheless. This movie is also a nice homage to the old Universal movies. Unfortunately, Young Frankenstein fails as a comedy. Not horribly, but still. Some of the jokes are repetitive and not very funny, although there are some truly amusing scenes. Also, some parts are slow and boring. But considering how horrible modern spoofs are, this movie really shouldn't be bashed. I would definitely recommend watching it, especially since the first time you might just find it hilarious. Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    - A- This is a very funny film as a comedy of the Frankenstein's monster story. The film has solid laughs throughout, a good lead, and a fun monster. The story is the basic story of Frankenstein and the monster getting loose but in the middle are some laughs like the maid, Igor's hump' and many more. Gene Wilder is wild as the scientist and does one of his best jobs in maybe his best film. The monster is cool at first and then at the end is quite funny with a fun twist to the take off. A very successful story that could turn into as much of a classic as the original horror is itself.

I am convinced that Brooks is not the source of this great film's humor! This is not an essay and I have no supporting work. But I do have a long history of watching Mel Brooks.

    Oh, where to begin. In my opinion, "Young Frankenstein" is one of the funniest movies ever made. From the first scene with Gene Wilder lecturing his class, to the "Abby Normal" sequence later on, this film is a joy to watch and will have have you smiling all the way through. After his grandfathers death, Dr. Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) begins experimenting with the idea of bringing dead humans back to life with the help of assistants Igor (pronounced Eye-gor) and Inga. From brief chuckles to bursts of hysterical laughter, this movie has it all. An interesting factoid is much of the equipment you see in the laboratory are original prop pieces used in the classic Boris Karloff film. Also note how the film was shot in purposely in black and white, despite the complaints from the studio. Later a Broadway musical written by director Mel Brooks.

    Young Frankenstein is a fantastic film with a very fun and cleverly parodied spoof of classic Frankenstein films that is directed very impressively by Mel Brooks and is a pitch perfect resemblance of how those films actually looked.The cast is very inspired and all play really funny and unique characters,obviously the best performance is from the great Gene Wilder,this man just knows how to act,but in a serious and comedic way,and the other cast members all do a great job as well,the two that really stand out for me are Peter Boyle and Gene Hackman's cameo.I don't think it's Mel Brooks or Gene Wilder's best film,but all fans of classic comedy will really appreciate it,and fans of classic monster films will appreciate its very impressive parody. Dr Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is assigned to recreate his grandfathers well known experiment,something he has being trying to avoid for many years.

    Spoofs ate ten a penny these days but Young Frankenstein had so much care and attention put in by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, making it fresh and innovative. What works is the atmosphere, filmed in Black and White and evoking the sets, location of the Universal 1930's Frankenstein films you are easily brought in to the atmosphere which get regularly punctures with jokes, one liners and visual jokes such as the enormous knockers on the door as they arrive at the castle. The cast of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Khan, Cloris Leachman, Terri Garr milk the laughs for all its worth. Gene Hackman is a hoot as the blind hermit which sends to monster scurrying after he offers cigars. Feldman's Igor is the best and both Kahn and Garr are sensual and sexy. After almost 40 years, its still mad and funny.

    In his heyday, Mel Brooks was the most skilled specialist in parody films. He tackled all manner of genres but Young Frankenstein is possibly his best. In this one the target was 1930's Universal horror movies, or more specifically the 'Frankenstein' films. What makes this one work so well is that, aside from Brooks' typical crazed humour; there is a real attempt to capture the look and feel of those old movies it is satirizing. The sumptuous black and white photography and the elaborate sets all recall the Universal 'Frankenstein' outings. And overall there is an unmistakable loving care at work. Brooks is definitely respectful of the films he is parodying and this ensures that they have not only the laughs but a fine attention to detail. Quite a few of the funniest moments require audience familiarity with the source movies, so Young Frankenstein is not simply pandering to easy laughs but working in specific references as well. The other thing that really helps massively is the cast. Gene Wilder is undoubtedly the star of the show as the title character. This film really shows why he remains one of the funniest cinema actors of all time. Peter Boyle's portrayal of the monster is a good rival to Boris Karloff's original but with great comic timing  his performance of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' is inspired hilarity. While Gene Hackman is hilarious as the blind hermit, his scene with Boyle is comic gold from start to finish and is one of the undoubted highlights of the movie. To be fair, like all Brooks movies, this is still somewhat uneven in bits. Some of the humour doesn't really work so well. Marty Feldman, for example, looks really funny but his comic delivery is pretty poor. But in the main, the jokes still work more than they do not. On the whole it's a great looking, funny film.

    It helps immensely to not only be familiar with the Universal Frankenstein Series, but to know them implicitly. Because much of the best humor here is derived from direct parody of certain famous scenes. This is typical Mel Brooks with its broad and lewd fixation on Sex and Human Sexuality, but these don't work the best in this Film. But, it is consistently funny with some clever slapstick and wordplay. Some of it is quite refreshingly inventive ("Abbey Normal") and Cloris Leachman's deadpan mugging. The Hunchback (what hunch?) Igor (pronounced eye-gore) also is a field day for Marty Feldman. Add to this the spot on mimicry of the one armed Captain from the Son of' Movie, and the inspired Peter Boyle's Creature, it all sums up for a great looking love-fest from Brooks and company. The one drawback is the relentless screaming of lines, when they would have been even more effective delivered a bit more restrained. But when Gene Wilder isn't shouting he is rather amusing wavering between straight faced Satire and unhinged psychopathy.

    This movie is just so funny I couldn't stop laughing. This might be Mel Brook's funniest movie including Blazing Saddles, which was super funny in it's own right. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, and Teri Garr are just fantastic in this movie. Teri Garr is the sexiest I have ever seen her, including the movie where she showed skin.The outset of the movie has Gene refusing his heritage as a Frankenstein. He eventually goes to his ancestral castle and Cloris Leachman, the house keeper and old Frankentein's lover as it turns out, lures him to the old laboratory used by his ancestor. He goes through the usual procedures and creates a monster (?) played very well by Peter Boyd (RIP). Kenneth Mars plays an excellent inspector Kemp and I love his fake hand. The ending where Gene and Peter swap some of their brains and, as it turns out body parts is just too funny. I like Madelaine Kahn is good as the uptight I want it my way until she hooks up with the monster is a nice touch.

    had absolutely no clue what to expect from this film as no one prepared me for the insane hilarity with such subtle surprising humor... actually was quite upset that I waited over 20 years to watch this, and given how difficult it is to construct an homage comedy I was very impressed how easily I heartily laughed out loud appreciating the comedic genius of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder... many would debate the Putting on the Ritz routine as too out there but I found the scene most entertaining and a crowning achievement for our dear sweet crowd loving monster... quotable, memorable, brilliant, and most joyous, can highly recommend this for another 20 years minimum!

    Young Frankenstein is a fantastic film with a very fun and cleverly parodied spoof of classic Frankenstein films that is directed very impressively by Mel Brooks and is a pitch perfect resemblance of how those films actually looked.The cast is very inspired and all play really funny and unique characters,obviously the best performance is from the great Gene Wilder,this man just knows how to act,but in a serious and comedic way,and the other cast members all do a great job as well,the two that really stand out for me are Peter Boyle and Gene Hackman's cameo.I don't think it's Mel Brooks or Gene Wilder's best film,but all fans of classic comedy will really appreciate it,and fans of classic monster films will appreciate its very impressive parody. Dr Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is assigned to recreate his grandfathers well known experiment,something he has being trying to avoid for many years.

    Spoofs ate ten a penny these days but Young Frankenstein had so much care and attention put in by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, making it fresh and innovative. What works is the atmosphere, filmed in Black and White and evoking the sets, location of the Universal 1930's Frankenstein films you are easily brought in to the atmosphere which get regularly punctures with jokes, one liners and visual jokes such as the enormous knockers on the door as they arrive at the castle. The cast of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Khan, Cloris Leachman, Terri Garr milk the laughs for all its worth. Gene Hackman is a hoot as the blind hermit which sends to monster scurrying after he offers cigars. Feldman's Igor is the best and both Kahn and Garr are sensual and sexy. After almost 40 years, its still mad and funny.

    In his heyday, Mel Brooks was the most skilled specialist in parody films. He tackled all manner of genres but Young Frankenstein is possibly his best. In this one the target was 1930's Universal horror movies, or more specifically the 'Frankenstein' films. What makes this one work so well is that, aside from Brooks' typical crazed humour; there is a real attempt to capture the look and feel of those old movies it is satirizing. The sumptuous black and white photography and the elaborate sets all recall the Universal 'Frankenstein' outings. And overall there is an unmistakable loving care at work. Brooks is definitely respectful of the films he is parodying and this ensures that they have not only the laughs but a fine attention to detail. Quite a few of the funniest moments require audience familiarity with the source movies, so Young Frankenstein is not simply pandering to easy laughs but working in specific references as well. The other thing that really helps massively is the cast. Gene Wilder is undoubtedly the star of the show as the title character. This film really shows why he remains one of the funniest cinema actors of all time. Peter Boyle's portrayal of the monster is a good rival to Boris Karloff's original but with great comic timing  his performance of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' is inspired hilarity. While Gene Hackman is hilarious as the blind hermit, his scene with Boyle is comic gold from start to finish and is one of the undoubted highlights of the movie. To be fair, like all Brooks movies, this is still somewhat uneven in bits. Some of the humour doesn't really work so well. Marty Feldman, for example, looks really funny but his comic delivery is pretty poor. But in the main, the jokes still work more than they do not. On the whole it's a great looking, funny film.

    It helps immensely to not only be familiar with the Universal Frankenstein Series, but to know them implicitly. Because much of the best humor here is derived from direct parody of certain famous scenes. This is typical Mel Brooks with its broad and lewd fixation on Sex and Human Sexuality, but these don't work the best in this Film. But, it is consistently funny with some clever slapstick and wordplay. Some of it is quite refreshingly inventive ("Abbey Normal") and Cloris Leachman's deadpan mugging. The Hunchback (what hunch?) Igor (pronounced eye-gore) also is a field day for Marty Feldman. Add to this the spot on mimicry of the one armed Captain from the Son of' Movie, and the inspired Peter Boyle's Creature, it all sums up for a great looking love-fest from Brooks and company. The one drawback is the relentless screaming of lines, when they would have been even more effective delivered a bit more restrained. But when Gene Wilder isn't shouting he is rather amusing wavering between straight faced Satire and unhinged psychopathy.

    This movie is just so funny I couldn't stop laughing. This might be Mel Brook's funniest movie including Blazing Saddles, which was super funny in it's own right. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, and Teri Garr are just fantastic in this movie. Teri Garr is the sexiest I have ever seen her, including the movie where she showed skin.The outset of the movie has Gene refusing his heritage as a Frankenstein. He eventually goes to his ancestral castle and Cloris Leachman, the house keeper and old Frankentein's lover as it turns out, lures him to the old laboratory used by his ancestor. He goes through the usual procedures and creates a monster (?) played very well by Peter Boyd (RIP). Kenneth Mars plays an excellent inspector Kemp and I love his fake hand. The ending where Gene and Peter swap some of their brains and, as it turns out body parts is just too funny. I like Madelaine Kahn is good as the uptight I want it my way until she hooks up with the monster is a nice touch.

    had absolutely no clue what to expect from this film as no one prepared me for the insane hilarity with such subtle surprising humor... actually was quite upset that I waited over 20 years to watch this, and given how difficult it is to construct an homage comedy I was very impressed how easily I heartily laughed out loud appreciating the comedic genius of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder... many would debate the Putting on the Ritz routine as too out there but I found the scene most entertaining and a crowning achievement for our dear sweet crowd loving monster... quotable, memorable, brilliant, and most joyous, can highly recommend this for another 20 years minimum!

    Young Frankenstein is praised by many as one of the funniest movies in history. It is certainly a lovely movie, with great performances  mainly those of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman  and an interesting, modern remake of the original Mary Shelley novel. I particularly liked the fact that it's black and white  this helps greatly in creating the creepy and old-movie-like atmosphere. It's also quite funny, but I suggest you don't see it more than once because it might disappoint you after more viewings. The respectable doctor Frederik Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has tried for many years to cut the ties with his family, as his grandfather, the baron, had become famous for trying to reanimate dead bodies and in his opinion, his grandfather's work was crap. But after he arrives to the Transylvanian castle that belonged to his late grandfather, Frederik discovers his diary and decides to try and reanimate someone dead himself, as it appears his grandfather had succeeded. In this task, he is aided by Igor (Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr). As I said, the atmosphere in this movie is great: it's all black and white, and it features mostly night scenes in the creepy Transylvanian environment, with howling wolves and fog all around. This characteristic is also very well used in some jokes. Marty Feldman is amazing as Igor, and the character himself is so funny and strange, it's delightful to watch him. Gene Wilder does an incredible job in portraying Dr. Frankenstein, especially in his madness. Peter Boyle, even though he doesn't speak most of the time since he's the monster, is very good nonetheless. This movie is also a nice homage to the old Universal movies. Unfortunately, Young Frankenstein fails as a comedy. Not horribly, but still. Some of the jokes are repetitive and not very funny, although there are some truly amusing scenes. Also, some parts are slow and boring. But considering how horrible modern spoofs are, this movie really shouldn't be bashed. I would definitely recommend watching it, especially since the first time you might just find it hilarious. Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    - A- This is a very funny film as a comedy of the Frankenstein's monster story. The film has solid laughs throughout, a good lead, and a fun monster. The story is the basic story of Frankenstein and the monster getting loose but in the middle are some laughs like the maid, Igor's hump' and many more. Gene Wilder is wild as the scientist and does one of his best jobs in maybe his best film. The monster is cool at first and then at the end is quite funny with a fun twist to the take off. A very successful story that could turn into as much of a classic as the original horror is itself.

    This is a classic. No argument I've heard has changed that. HOWEVER, I am 100% convinced that the director, Mel Brooks, is not as present in this project as you would think. I am convinced that Brooks is not the source of this great film's humor! This is not an essay and I have no supporting work. But I do have a long history of watching Mel Brooks. I don't want to add much more but I am compelled to write by the blah blah to get more blah blah and add to the line of copblah copblay! Also b lah , and also blah So in conclusion chal blah and don't let the system own you. Be YOU.!! Tim a aq a

    Oh, where to begin. In my opinion, "Young Frankenstein" is one of the funniest movies ever made. From the first scene with Gene Wilder lecturing his class, to the "Abby Normal" sequence later on, this film is a joy to watch and will have have you smiling all the way through. After his grandfathers death, Dr. Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) begins experimenting with the idea of bringing dead humans back to life with the help of assistants Igor (pronounced Eye-gor) and Inga. From brief chuckles to bursts of hysterical laughter, this movie has it all. An interesting factoid is much of the equipment you see in the laboratory are original prop pieces used in the classic Boris Karloff film. Also note how the film was shot in purposely in black and white, despite the complaints from the studio. Later a Broadway musical written by director Mel Brooks.

    This movie is just so funny I couldn't stop laughing. This might be Mel Brook's funniest movie including Blazing Saddles, which was super funny in it's own right. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, and Teri Garr are just fantastic in this movie. Teri Garr is the sexiest I have ever seen her, including the movie where she showed skin.The outset of the movie has Gene refusing his heritage as a Frankenstein. He eventually goes to his ancestral castle and Cloris Leachman, the house keeper and old Frankentein's lover as it turns out, lures him to the old laboratory used by his ancestor. He goes through the usual procedures and creates a monster (?) played very well by Peter Boyd (RIP). Kenneth Mars plays an excellent inspector Kemp and I love his fake hand. The ending where Gene and Peter swap some of their brains and, as it turns out body parts is just too funny. I like Madelaine Kahn is good as the uptight I want it my way until she hooks up with the monster is a nice touch.

    had absolutely no clue what to expect from this film as no one prepared me for the insane hilarity with such subtle surprising humor... actually was quite upset that I waited over 20 years to watch this, and given how difficult it is to construct an homage comedy I was very impressed how easily I heartily laughed out loud appreciating the comedic genius of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder... many would debate the Putting on the Ritz routine as too out there but I found the scene most entertaining and a crowning achievement for our dear sweet crowd loving monster... quotable, memorable, brilliant, and most joyous, can highly recommend this for another 20 years minimum!

    Young Frankenstein is praised by many as one of the funniest movies in history. It is certainly a lovely movie, with great performances  mainly those of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman  and an interesting, modern remake of the original Mary Shelley novel. I particularly liked the fact that it's black and white  this helps greatly in creating the creepy and old-movie-like atmosphere. It's also quite funny, but I suggest you don't see it more than once because it might disappoint you after more viewings. The respectable doctor Frederik Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has tried for many years to cut the ties with his family, as his grandfather, the baron, had become famous for trying to reanimate dead bodies and in his opinion, his grandfather's work was crap. But after he arrives to the Transylvanian castle that belonged to his late grandfather, Frederik discovers his diary and decides to try and reanimate someone dead himself, as it appears his grandfather had succeeded. In this task, he is aided by Igor (Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr). As I said, the atmosphere in this movie is great: it's all black and white, and it features mostly night scenes in the creepy Transylvanian environment, with howling wolves and fog all around. This characteristic is also very well used in some jokes. Marty Feldman is amazing as Igor, and the character himself is so funny and strange, it's delightful to watch him. Gene Wilder does an incredible job in portraying Dr. Frankenstein, especially in his madness. Peter Boyle, even though he doesn't speak most of the time since he's the monster, is very good nonetheless. This movie is also a nice homage to the old Universal movies. Unfortunately, Young Frankenstein fails as a comedy. Not horribly, but still. Some of the jokes are repetitive and not very funny, although there are some truly amusing scenes. Also, some parts are slow and boring. But considering how horrible modern spoofs are, this movie really shouldn't be bashed. I would definitely recommend watching it, especially since the first time you might just find it hilarious. Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    - A- This is a very funny film as a comedy of the Frankenstein's monster story. The film has solid laughs throughout, a good lead, and a fun monster. The story is the basic story of Frankenstein and the monster getting loose but in the middle are some laughs like the maid, Igor's hump' and many more. Gene Wilder is wild as the scientist and does one of his best jobs in maybe his best film. The monster is cool at first and then at the end is quite funny with a fun twist to the take off. A very successful story that could turn into as much of a classic as the original horror is itself.

    This is a classic. No argument I've heard has changed that. HOWEVER, I am 100% convinced that the director, Mel Brooks, is not as present in this project as you would think. I am convinced that Brooks is not the source of this great film's humor! This is not an essay and I have no supporting work. But I do have a long history of watching Mel Brooks. I don't want to add much more but I am compelled to write by the blah blah to get more blah blah and add to the line of copblah copblay! Also b lah , and also blah So in conclusion chal blah and don't let the system own you. Be YOU.!! Tim a aq a

    Oh, where to begin. In my opinion, "Young Frankenstein" is one of the funniest movies ever made. From the first scene with Gene Wilder lecturing his class, to the "Abby Normal" sequence later on, this film is a joy to watch and will have have you smiling all the way through. After his grandfathers death, Dr. Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) begins experimenting with the idea of bringing dead humans back to life with the help of assistants Igor (pronounced Eye-gor) and Inga. From brief chuckles to bursts of hysterical laughter, this movie has it all. An interesting factoid is much of the equipment you see in the laboratory are original prop pieces used in the classic Boris Karloff film. Also note how the film was shot in purposely in black and white, despite the complaints from the studio. Later a Broadway musical written by director Mel Brooks.
