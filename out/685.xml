  Terrorists take over a 747 bound from Athens to Washington D.C., supposedly to effect the release of their leader.

    Suspenseful nail-biter with a good Cast and an Editor turned Director debuting with an Action Movie that has less Action than most but relies on tight claustrophobic conditions to propel the Story of perils on a plane hijacked by a nut-job. He is of the "Belief" that destroying millions and millions of Men, Women, and Children because they are different will somehow make the World a better place. Get the straight-jacket! Good ol' Planet Earth has contended with such Evil since forever and the only thing that has changed is the amount of time it takes to wipe out so many with so little planning by a deluded, brain washed Megalomaniac. This is a thrilling ride and is worth a view. Thankfully, there are minimum explosions, minimum automatic weapon fire, but a maximum of pulse pounding scenarios. Just a bit different and at the same time the same and that results in a Movie that is exciting Entertainment.

    An Islamist terror cell hijacks a trans-Atlantic flight . They demand the release of El Sayed Jaffa who is held in custody and a daring rescue mission led by special forces officer Colonel Austin Travis and academic Dr David Grant do their best to thwart the terrorist plan EXECUTIVE DECISION is a well worn clich&eacute;d tale of terrorist nutjobs bringing death and destruction to the United States and it's up to some good old stock characters to stop them . The special forces team is composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino and an oriental making up a fine cross section of the American public same as Hollywood as a violent street gang of thugs composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino ... There's also a stewardess who cometh the hour cometh the ballsy heroine and of course the bad guy is despite being an Arab with theocratic leanings is played by a well regarded British actor In other words this is a clich&eacute;d movie where no clich&eacute;d stone is left unturned and yet another clich&eacute; raises its ugly head . And yet despite this EXECUTIVE DECISION disguises the clich&eacute;s very well . What helps tremendously is the way it pulls the rug out from the audiences feet where early on when a character played by a very well known actor is killed off early on . David Suchet plays the chief villain in a way only British actors seem capable of by making Nagi Hassan if not a sophisticated multi-layered three dimensional baddie then certainly not a one dimensional parody the character could have been This is a thriller produced between DIE HARD and 9/11 and is obviously the sort of movie that wouldn't be produced today . It's a film that was produced simply as enthralling popcorn entertainment rather than portent warning but as popcorn entertainment it works very well and disguises the numerous clich&eacute;s throughout the plotting

    One of a number of airborne riffs on Die Hard to come out at the time - Air Force One among them. This is up there with Air Force One on the loopy scale, what with it's 'F-117X Remora' modified stealth fighter that would not look amiss if it was called 'Thunderbird 7'. While there's nothing particularly surprising about it, it does provide effective entertainment, and does a good job of ratcheting up the tension level. Kurt Russell is a hero of the Jack Ryan mould, an intelligence desk jockey out of his depth when thrust into a crisis. Despite his feelings about the film, Steven Seagal isn't too bad as the combat team leader. John Leguizamo is as you'd expect. Halle Berry always has our sympathies as the brave stewardess, while David Suchet makes a truly terrifying villain, who's just as quick to execute one of his own men as he is any of the passengers. In the end, it's nothing special, but action fans ought to check it out.

    Two incidents occur; at first unrelated, they will be connected to a terrifying plot to bomb "half the Eastern Seaboard" of the United States. First, a US undercover team fails to recover a supply of the nerve toxin DZ-5, recently stolen from the Russians. Second, the US captures the world's "most feared and wanted terrorist." Of course, Islamists are furious. Led by dastardly David Suchet (as Nagi Hassan), a gang of Arabs hijack "Oceanic Airlines" flight #343, an American 747 bound for Washington DC. The terrorists want their leader released, or they will shoot over 400 passengers, one-by-one... "Executive Decision" features a great stunt, amid the usual clich&eacute;s. Herein, a stealth aircraft attaches itself to the hijacked plane so heroic Kurt Russell (as David Grant) and a group can secretly get on board. A cool, workable, idea - though some of the other, more minor, stuff is implausible. Nobody steps on any probes (they could have said the plane has security cameras and tap into them)... Leading the crew are engaging John Leguizamo (as Carlos "Rat" Lopez), straw-chewing Oliver Platt (as Dennis Cahill) and wire expert Joe Morton (as Campbell "Cappy" Matheny). Strange castaway Steven Seagal (as Austin Travis) is included for "box office" appeal, but it's difficult to explain the presence of Donald Trump's (then) newest wife. Pretty flight attendant Halle Berry (as Jean) is helpful... The film maintains excitement very well, but there is some turbulence in the production. Pieces of film sometimes appear too loose and others seem missing. For example, a hijacker in disguise is suddenly transformed into reality, hair and make-up looking perfect; we see a shot of him before and the disguise after, but no shot establishing him offing the disguise (even if the disguised actor was a stand-in, something could have been done). You're often not sure where you are, but it's still an entertaining ride. ****** Executive Decision (3/15/96) Stuart Baird ~ Kurt Russell, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt

    When terrorists hijack a 747 bound for Washington they demand the release of their group's leader who had recently been captured. Initial plans are to play ball with them until they land then deal with them but State Department analyst XXX Grant believes the terrorists are in position of a deadly nerve agent and their demands are just an excuse to get the plane in to Washington airspace. If this is correct there are only two options; blow the plane out of the sky or use a classified stealth plane to transfer an elite commando group led by Col. Travis onto the plane in midair! Grant goes along too as his knowledge of the terrorists may be needed. An accident mid-transfer leaves the team aboard the 747 with half their kit missing, no way to contact anybody and with important team members dead or injuredÂ… if they are to save everybody on board Grant will have to identify the lead terrorist and the person in charge of the bomb before the plane enters US airspace! This film has plenty of action and the times in between the action are very tense as the commandos could be discovered at any time as the move through the areas of the plane passengers never see. There are some major surprises including the death of somebody most viewers will expect to be one of the stars of the film! There are plenty of well known actors including Kurt Russell and Steven Seagal as Grant and Travis; Halle Berry as a helpful stewardess and David Suchet as the leader of the terrorists aboard the plane; other main characters are played by familiar faces too. The cast does a fine job and Director Stuart Baird keeps the tension high from start to finish. Inevitably there are a few clich&eacute; moments but one expects a few in films like this. If you like action thrillers then this one is well worth watching.

    Kurt Russell does it again! It is very rare to catch Kurt Russell making a bad film and it's no surprise to me that he makes this film just as exciting as the many others that he's done in the past. And it's not just him either; Russell is paired up with several other actors to make this movie good. Executive Decision (1996) is the story of when a small military group and a few civilians take on an impossible looking task when an airplane is hijacked by terrorists. There isn't much to say about Kurt Russell and his character, Dr. David Grant, because it's likable like any other character that he's done before. Because Grant's a civilian in this story, of course he's going to be much more nervous than his military counterparts. Two other civilians that play key roles in this story is engineer Dennis Cahil (Oliver Platt) and flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry). Platt is good making his character sound like he knows what he's talking about, until he's called upon to diffuse a bomb, but hey, I'd be nervous too if I was him. Halle Berry also plays her role quite accurately as a nervous but strong willed flight attendant. If the situation were for real, it would take a lot of guts to put herself in so much danger. John Leguizamo, BD Wong, Joe Morton, Whip Hubley and Steven Seagal play the military squad. All of which I commend for their believable and entertaining performances as troopers under the gun and under a lot of pressure. Even the actors who portrayed the terrorists did a good job at instilling fear in the plot. What specifically makes this film so good though is how continuously stressful the situation is and becomes as the plot runs it course. Plus, there are several times where the possibility of the covert operation being discovered by the terrorists. And if it's not this, it's the fact that there's the possibility of a bomb going off. In many peoples' opinion, the stakes are way too high and there are too many odds against them. And for a while, I was thinking that too! Adding to the suspense is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. In some ways it sounds like a premature attempt at the Small Soldiers (1998) theme, but either way it works well. My only complaint with Goldsmith is that he couldn't make one last track for the credits. Why? Which leads me to the problems I had with this film. The ending is good to this movie but the way it transitions in tone from high tension to relaxation is way too abrupt. I won't say much, because I don't want to give it away but how does playing a Frank Sinatra tune at the credits appropriate to the ending? It's like the main characters are just purposefully forgetting all the damage that occurred through the whole movie! Yeah,...everything's all happy-go-lucky. Then there's the whole issue with the innocent bystanders who die in this movie. Yes, this movie is rated R, not everyone lives (but I won't say who)! How did the Thomas brothers (Jim & John) forget to write in a scene where the people who were lost are given a respectful burial? Isn't that kind of important? And finally, if any viewer doesn't like constant whispering, then I would not recommend this film because for the most of the beginning, everyone's whispering. To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird. The suspense is really high in this film and all the actors play their parts really well. Just watch out for the ending, which seems a little out of place.

    A near actionless knock-off of 'Die Hard' in which intelligence analyst (Russell) and commando (Seagal) must sneak on board a high-jacked airliner to prevent the terrorists from detonating a bomb over Washington D.C. Meanwhile, the President is wondering whether or not he should avoid the risk altogether by having the plain shot down, civilians and all. It sounds exiting but it's really very uneventful. Apparenly, (spolier) Seagal's character was killed-off early because he was being a jerk on-set and everyone was tired of working with him. I guess you could call that an 'executive decision' on the part of the producer.

    This film has and incredibly far fletched plot. Right from the beginning of the production one sees technical gimmicks that somehow or other are too unbelievable. Not getting into the story I find it unbelievable that the jumbo jet takes off with Rolls Royce engines yet halfway across the Atlantic Ocean the jumbo is sporting Pratt and Whitney engines. That is quite a feat, being able to change engines on a heavy jet while in mid flight. For me that destroyed the credibility of this movie. No matter how good the rest of the special effects were this fatal flaw showed an oversight on the part of the technical consultant and is unbelievable for such a highly experienced director such as Stuart Baird.

    This film was amazing! All of the actors were brilliant and Kurt Russell should definitely stick to being a buisinessman who knows how to shoot. Also, David Suchet - seeing Hercules Poirot as a bad guy was undeniably a work of a genius. The storyline was great and realistic but now i'll get to the flaws. For starters Steven Seagal died during the epic mid-air transfer. :( That was their first mistake. It should never have happened. Next, with the amount of times Halle Berry had run-ins with Suchet she should have been shot through the head! Next, the simple fact that the terrorists took ages to check the service hatch was wrong. They should have checked straight away. And last but not least was the fiasco where the master terrorist got released from prison and put on a jet at the end. I don't object to that but when the pentagon found out that the plane had bee secured they should have immediately brought the plane back or shot it down. Anything to stop the terrorist from escaping. Anywy don't let the bad deter you from watching this film. Despite the flaws it was still a satisfyingly good watch. P.S. I know there are spoilers but they were necessary.

    I'm afraid to say that I didn't full attention to this film at all when it was on, but to be honest I'm really not that bothered, from what I could gather it looked a little dull for a film rated three stars out of five, from director Stuart Baird (U.S. Marshals, Star Trek: Nemesis). Basically terrorists led by Nagi Hassan (David Suchet) have hijacked a plane, flight 747 bound from Athens to Washington D.C., and they are demanding the release of their leader from prison in exchange for all the passengers on board. Dr. David Grant (Kurt Russell) discovers however that this is not their true plan, they have a bomb on the plane that when dropped will release a large amount of nerve gas on detonation. So with the help of Lt. Colonel Austin Travis (Razzie nominated Steven Seagal), Captain Rat (John Leguizamo) and bomb expert Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt), Grant and the small United States Army Special Forces team get themselves on board, unnoticed, and try to save everyone. At the same time, hostages including plane flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry) follow the instructions of their kidnappers, while trying to find a way to get help or spoil their plan. Also starring Joe Morton as Sergeant 'Cappy' Matheny, B.D. Wong as Sergeant Louie, Len Cariou as Secretary of Defense Charles White, Andreas Katsulas as El Sayed Jaffa and J.T. Walsh as Senator Mavros. I was so in and out of the film, I wasn't dozing off, I was just doing other stuff at the same time, so I even missed how Seagal sacrifices himself, it didn't look all that engaging or exciting, but when I did pay attention, it had its very, very tiny moments, a fair action thriller. Okay!

It's like the main characters are just purposefully forgetting all the damage that occurred through the whole movie! Yeah,...everything's all happy-go-lucky. Then there's the whole issue with the innocent bystanders who die in this movie. Yes, this movie is rated R, not everyone lives (but I won't say who)! How did the Thomas brothers (Jim & John) forget to write in a scene where the people who were lost are given a respectful burial? Isn't that kind of important? And finally, if any viewer doesn't like constant whispering, then I would not recommend this film because for the most of the beginning, everyone's whispering. To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird. The suspense is really high in this film and all the actors play their parts really well. Just watch out for the ending, which seems a little out of place.

    A near actionless knock-off of 'Die Hard' in which intelligence analyst (Russell) and commando (Seagal) must sneak on board a high-jacked airliner to prevent the terrorists from detonating a bomb over Washington D.C. Meanwhile, the President is wondering whether or not he should avoid the risk altogether by having the plain shot down, civilians and all. It sounds exiting but it's really very uneventful. Apparenly, (spolier) Seagal's character was killed-off early because he was being a jerk on-set and everyone was tired of working with him. I guess you could call that an 'executive decision' on the part of the producer.

    This film has and incredibly far fletched plot. Right from the beginning of the production one sees technical gimmicks that somehow or other are too unbelievable. Not getting into the story I find it unbelievable that the jumbo jet takes off with Rolls Royce engines yet halfway across the Atlantic Ocean the jumbo is sporting Pratt and Whitney engines. That is quite a feat, being able to change engines on a heavy jet while in mid flight. For me that destroyed the credibility of this movie. No matter how good the rest of the special effects were this fatal flaw showed an oversight on the part of the technical consultant and is unbelievable for such a highly experienced director such as Stuart Baird.

    This film was amazing! All of the actors were brilliant and Kurt Russell should definitely stick to being a buisinessman who knows how to shoot. Also, David Suchet - seeing Hercules Poirot as a bad guy was undeniably a work of a genius. The storyline was great and realistic but now i'll get to the flaws. For starters Steven Seagal died during the epic mid-air transfer. :( That was their first mistake. It should never have happened. Next, with the amount of times Halle Berry had run-ins with Suchet she should have been shot through the head! Next, the simple fact that the terrorists took ages to check the service hatch was wrong. They should have checked straight away. And last but not least was the fiasco where the master terrorist got released from prison and put on a jet at the end. I don't object to that but when the pentagon found out that the plane had bee secured they should have immediately brought the plane back or shot it down. Anything to stop the terrorist from escaping. Anywy don't let the bad deter you from watching this film. Despite the flaws it was still a satisfyingly good watch. P.S. I know there are spoilers but they were necessary.

    I'm afraid to say that I didn't full attention to this film at all when it was on, but to be honest I'm really not that bothered, from what I could gather it looked a little dull for a film rated three stars out of five, from director Stuart Baird (U.S. Marshals, Star Trek: Nemesis). Basically terrorists led by Nagi Hassan (David Suchet) have hijacked a plane, flight 747 bound from Athens to Washington D.C., and they are demanding the release of their leader from prison in exchange for all the passengers on board. Dr. David Grant (Kurt Russell) discovers however that this is not their true plan, they have a bomb on the plane that when dropped will release a large amount of nerve gas on detonation. So with the help of Lt. Colonel Austin Travis (Razzie nominated Steven Seagal), Captain Rat (John Leguizamo) and bomb expert Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt), Grant and the small United States Army Special Forces team get themselves on board, unnoticed, and try to save everyone. At the same time, hostages including plane flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry) follow the instructions of their kidnappers, while trying to find a way to get help or spoil their plan. Also starring Joe Morton as Sergeant 'Cappy' Matheny, B.D. Wong as Sergeant Louie, Len Cariou as Secretary of Defense Charles White, Andreas Katsulas as El Sayed Jaffa and J.T. Walsh as Senator Mavros. I was so in and out of the film, I wasn't dozing off, I was just doing other stuff at the same time, so I even missed how Seagal sacrifices himself, it didn't look all that engaging or exciting, but when I did pay attention, it had its very, very tiny moments, a fair action thriller. Okay!

    Suspenseful nail-biter with a good Cast and an Editor turned Director debuting with an Action Movie that has less Action than most but relies on tight claustrophobic conditions to propel the Story of perils on a plane hijacked by a nut-job. He is of the "Belief" that destroying millions and millions of Men, Women, and Children because they are different will somehow make the World a better place. Get the straight-jacket! Good ol' Planet Earth has contended with such Evil since forever and the only thing that has changed is the amount of time it takes to wipe out so many with so little planning by a deluded, brain washed Megalomaniac. This is a thrilling ride and is worth a view. Thankfully, there are minimum explosions, minimum automatic weapon fire, but a maximum of pulse pounding scenarios. Just a bit different and at the same time the same and that results in a Movie that is exciting Entertainment.

    An Islamist terror cell hijacks a trans-Atlantic flight . They demand the release of El Sayed Jaffa who is held in custody and a daring rescue mission led by special forces officer Colonel Austin Travis and academic Dr David Grant do their best to thwart the terrorist plan EXECUTIVE DECISION is a well worn clich&eacute;d tale of terrorist nutjobs bringing death and destruction to the United States and it's up to some good old stock characters to stop them . The special forces team is composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino and an oriental making up a fine cross section of the American public same as Hollywood as a violent street gang of thugs composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino ... There's also a stewardess who cometh the hour cometh the ballsy heroine and of course the bad guy is despite being an Arab with theocratic leanings is played by a well regarded British actor In other words this is a clich&eacute;d movie where no clich&eacute;d stone is left unturned and yet another clich&eacute; raises its ugly head . And yet despite this EXECUTIVE DECISION disguises the clich&eacute;s very well . What helps tremendously is the way it pulls the rug out from the audiences feet where early on when a character played by a very well known actor is killed off early on . David Suchet plays the chief villain in a way only British actors seem capable of by making Nagi Hassan if not a sophisticated multi-layered three dimensional baddie then certainly not a one dimensional parody the character could have been This is a thriller produced between DIE HARD and 9/11 and is obviously the sort of movie that wouldn't be produced today . It's a film that was produced simply as enthralling popcorn entertainment rather than portent warning but as popcorn entertainment it works very well and disguises the numerous clich&eacute;s throughout the plotting

    One of a number of airborne riffs on Die Hard to come out at the time - Air Force One among them. This is up there with Air Force One on the loopy scale, what with it's 'F-117X Remora' modified stealth fighter that would not look amiss if it was called 'Thunderbird 7'. While there's nothing particularly surprising about it, it does provide effective entertainment, and does a good job of ratcheting up the tension level. Kurt Russell is a hero of the Jack Ryan mould, an intelligence desk jockey out of his depth when thrust into a crisis. Despite his feelings about the film, Steven Seagal isn't too bad as the combat team leader. John Leguizamo is as you'd expect. Halle Berry always has our sympathies as the brave stewardess, while David Suchet makes a truly terrifying villain, who's just as quick to execute one of his own men as he is any of the passengers. In the end, it's nothing special, but action fans ought to check it out.

    Two incidents occur; at first unrelated, they will be connected to a terrifying plot to bomb "half the Eastern Seaboard" of the United States. First, a US undercover team fails to recover a supply of the nerve toxin DZ-5, recently stolen from the Russians. Second, the US captures the world's "most feared and wanted terrorist." Of course, Islamists are furious. Led by dastardly David Suchet (as Nagi Hassan), a gang of Arabs hijack "Oceanic Airlines" flight #343, an American 747 bound for Washington DC. The terrorists want their leader released, or they will shoot over 400 passengers, one-by-one... "Executive Decision" features a great stunt, amid the usual clich&eacute;s. Herein, a stealth aircraft attaches itself to the hijacked plane so heroic Kurt Russell (as David Grant) and a group can secretly get on board. A cool, workable, idea - though some of the other, more minor, stuff is implausible. Nobody steps on any probes (they could have said the plane has security cameras and tap into them)... Leading the crew are engaging John Leguizamo (as Carlos "Rat" Lopez), straw-chewing Oliver Platt (as Dennis Cahill) and wire expert Joe Morton (as Campbell "Cappy" Matheny). Strange castaway Steven Seagal (as Austin Travis) is included for "box office" appeal, but it's difficult to explain the presence of Donald Trump's (then) newest wife. Pretty flight attendant Halle Berry (as Jean) is helpful... The film maintains excitement very well, but there is some turbulence in the production. Pieces of film sometimes appear too loose and others seem missing. For example, a hijacker in disguise is suddenly transformed into reality, hair and make-up looking perfect; we see a shot of him before and the disguise after, but no shot establishing him offing the disguise (even if the disguised actor was a stand-in, something could have been done). You're often not sure where you are, but it's still an entertaining ride. ****** Executive Decision (3/15/96) Stuart Baird ~ Kurt Russell, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt

    When terrorists hijack a 747 bound for Washington they demand the release of their group's leader who had recently been captured. Initial plans are to play ball with them until they land then deal with them but State Department analyst XXX Grant believes the terrorists are in position of a deadly nerve agent and their demands are just an excuse to get the plane in to Washington airspace. If this is correct there are only two options; blow the plane out of the sky or use a classified stealth plane to transfer an elite commando group led by Col. Travis onto the plane in midair! Grant goes along too as his knowledge of the terrorists may be needed. An accident mid-transfer leaves the team aboard the 747 with half their kit missing, no way to contact anybody and with important team members dead or injuredÂ… if they are to save everybody on board Grant will have to identify the lead terrorist and the person in charge of the bomb before the plane enters US airspace! This film has plenty of action and the times in between the action are very tense as the commandos could be discovered at any time as the move through the areas of the plane passengers never see. There are some major surprises including the death of somebody most viewers will expect to be one of the stars of the film! There are plenty of well known actors including Kurt Russell and Steven Seagal as Grant and Travis; Halle Berry as a helpful stewardess and David Suchet as the leader of the terrorists aboard the plane; other main characters are played by familiar faces too. The cast does a fine job and Director Stuart Baird keeps the tension high from start to finish. Inevitably there are a few clich&eacute; moments but one expects a few in films like this. If you like action thrillers then this one is well worth watching.

    Kurt Russell does it again! It is very rare to catch Kurt Russell making a bad film and it's no surprise to me that he makes this film just as exciting as the many others that he's done in the past. And it's not just him either; Russell is paired up with several other actors to make this movie good. Executive Decision (1996) is the story of when a small military group and a few civilians take on an impossible looking task when an airplane is hijacked by terrorists. There isn't much to say about Kurt Russell and his character, Dr. David Grant, because it's likable like any other character that he's done before. Because Grant's a civilian in this story, of course he's going to be much more nervous than his military counterparts. Two other civilians that play key roles in this story is engineer Dennis Cahil (Oliver Platt) and flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry). Platt is good making his character sound like he knows what he's talking about, until he's called upon to diffuse a bomb, but hey, I'd be nervous too if I was him. Halle Berry also plays her role quite accurately as a nervous but strong willed flight attendant. If the situation were for real, it would take a lot of guts to put herself in so much danger. John Leguizamo, BD Wong, Joe Morton, Whip Hubley and Steven Seagal play the military squad. All of which I commend for their believable and entertaining performances as troopers under the gun and under a lot of pressure. Even the actors who portrayed the terrorists did a good job at instilling fear in the plot. What specifically makes this film so good though is how continuously stressful the situation is and becomes as the plot runs it course. Plus, there are several times where the possibility of the covert operation being discovered by the terrorists. And if it's not this, it's the fact that there's the possibility of a bomb going off. In many peoples' opinion, the stakes are way too high and there are too many odds against them. And for a while, I was thinking that too! Adding to the suspense is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. In some ways it sounds like a premature attempt at the Small Soldiers (1998) theme, but either way it works well. My only complaint with Goldsmith is that he couldn't make one last track for the credits. Why? Which leads me to the problems I had with this film. The ending is good to this movie but the way it transitions in tone from high tension to relaxation is way too abrupt. I won't say much, because I don't want to give it away but how does playing a Frank Sinatra tune at the credits appropriate to the ending? It's like the main characters are just purposefully forgetting all the damage that occurred through the whole movie! Yeah,...everything's all happy-go-lucky. Then there's the whole issue with the innocent bystanders who die in this movie. Yes, this movie is rated R, not everyone lives (but I won't say who)! How did the Thomas brothers (Jim & John) forget to write in a scene where the people who were lost are given a respectful burial? Isn't that kind of important? And finally, if any viewer doesn't like constant whispering, then I would not recommend this film because for the most of the beginning, everyone's whispering. To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird.

    When terrorists hijack a 747 bound for Washington they demand the release of their group's leader who had recently been captured. Initial plans are to play ball with them until they land then deal with them but State Department analyst XXX Grant believes the terrorists are in position of a deadly nerve agent and their demands are just an excuse to get the plane in to Washington airspace. If this is correct there are only two options; blow the plane out of the sky or use a classified stealth plane to transfer an elite commando group led by Col. Travis onto the plane in midair! Grant goes along too as his knowledge of the terrorists may be needed. An accident mid-transfer leaves the team aboard the 747 with half their kit missing, no way to contact anybody and with important team members dead or injuredÂ… if they are to save everybody on board Grant will have to identify the lead terrorist and the person in charge of the bomb before the plane enters US airspace! This film has plenty of action and the times in between the action are very tense as the commandos could be discovered at any time as the move through the areas of the plane passengers never see. There are some major surprises including the death of somebody most viewers will expect to be one of the stars of the film! There are plenty of well known actors including Kurt Russell and Steven Seagal as Grant and Travis; Halle Berry as a helpful stewardess and David Suchet as the leader of the terrorists aboard the plane; other main characters are played by familiar faces too. The cast does a fine job and Director Stuart Baird keeps the tension high from start to finish. Inevitably there are a few clich&eacute; moments but one expects a few in films like this. If you like action thrillers then this one is well worth watching.

    Kurt Russell does it again! It is very rare to catch Kurt Russell making a bad film and it's no surprise to me that he makes this film just as exciting as the many others that he's done in the past. And it's not just him either; Russell is paired up with several other actors to make this movie good. Executive Decision (1996) is the story of when a small military group and a few civilians take on an impossible looking task when an airplane is hijacked by terrorists. There isn't much to say about Kurt Russell and his character, Dr. David Grant, because it's likable like any other character that he's done before. Because Grant's a civilian in this story, of course he's going to be much more nervous than his military counterparts. Two other civilians that play key roles in this story is engineer Dennis Cahil (Oliver Platt) and flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry). Platt is good making his character sound like he knows what he's talking about, until he's called upon to diffuse a bomb, but hey, I'd be nervous too if I was him. Halle Berry also plays her role quite accurately as a nervous but strong willed flight attendant. If the situation were for real, it would take a lot of guts to put herself in so much danger. John Leguizamo, BD Wong, Joe Morton, Whip Hubley and Steven Seagal play the military squad. All of which I commend for their believable and entertaining performances as troopers under the gun and under a lot of pressure. Even the actors who portrayed the terrorists did a good job at instilling fear in the plot. What specifically makes this film so good though is how continuously stressful the situation is and becomes as the plot runs it course. Plus, there are several times where the possibility of the covert operation being discovered by the terrorists. And if it's not this, it's the fact that there's the possibility of a bomb going off. In many peoples' opinion, the stakes are way too high and there are too many odds against them. And for a while, I was thinking that too! Adding to the suspense is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. In some ways it sounds like a premature attempt at the Small Soldiers (1998) theme, but either way it works well. My only complaint with Goldsmith is that he couldn't make one last track for the credits. Why? Which leads me to the problems I had with this film. The ending is good to this movie but the way it transitions in tone from high tension to relaxation is way too abrupt. I won't say much, because I don't want to give it away but how does playing a Frank Sinatra tune at the credits appropriate to the ending? It's like the main characters are just purposefully forgetting all the damage that occurred through the whole movie! Yeah,...everything's all happy-go-lucky. Then there's the whole issue with the innocent bystanders who die in this movie. Yes, this movie is rated R, not everyone lives (but I won't say who)! How did the Thomas brothers (Jim & John) forget to write in a scene where the people who were lost are given a respectful burial? Isn't that kind of important? And finally, if any viewer doesn't like constant whispering, then I would not recommend this film because for the most of the beginning, everyone's whispering. To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird. The suspense is really high in this film and all the actors play their parts really well. Just watch out for the ending, which seems a little out of place.

    A near actionless knock-off of 'Die Hard' in which intelligence analyst (Russell) and commando (Seagal) must sneak on board a high-jacked airliner to prevent the terrorists from detonating a bomb over Washington D.C. Meanwhile, the President is wondering whether or not he should avoid the risk altogether by having the plain shot down, civilians and all. It sounds exiting but it's really very uneventful. Apparenly, (spolier) Seagal's character was killed-off early because he was being a jerk on-set and everyone was tired of working with him. I guess you could call that an 'executive decision' on the part of the producer.

    This film has and incredibly far fletched plot. Right from the beginning of the production one sees technical gimmicks that somehow or other are too unbelievable. Not getting into the story I find it unbelievable that the jumbo jet takes off with Rolls Royce engines yet halfway across the Atlantic Ocean the jumbo is sporting Pratt and Whitney engines. That is quite a feat, being able to change engines on a heavy jet while in mid flight. For me that destroyed the credibility of this movie. No matter how good the rest of the special effects were this fatal flaw showed an oversight on the part of the technical consultant and is unbelievable for such a highly experienced director such as Stuart Baird.

    This film was amazing! All of the actors were brilliant and Kurt Russell should definitely stick to being a buisinessman who knows how to shoot. Also, David Suchet - seeing Hercules Poirot as a bad guy was undeniably a work of a genius. The storyline was great and realistic but now i'll get to the flaws. For starters Steven Seagal died during the epic mid-air transfer. :( That was their first mistake. It should never have happened. Next, with the amount of times Halle Berry had run-ins with Suchet she should have been shot through the head! Next, the simple fact that the terrorists took ages to check the service hatch was wrong. They should have checked straight away. And last but not least was the fiasco where the master terrorist got released from prison and put on a jet at the end. I don't object to that but when the pentagon found out that the plane had bee secured they should have immediately brought the plane back or shot it down. Anything to stop the terrorist from escaping. Anywy don't let the bad deter you from watching this film. Despite the flaws it was still a satisfyingly good watch. P.S. I know there are spoilers but they were necessary.

    I'm afraid to say that I didn't full attention to this film at all when it was on, but to be honest I'm really not that bothered, from what I could gather it looked a little dull for a film rated three stars out of five, from director Stuart Baird (U.S. Marshals, Star Trek: Nemesis). Basically terrorists led by Nagi Hassan (David Suchet) have hijacked a plane, flight 747 bound from Athens to Washington D.C., and they are demanding the release of their leader from prison in exchange for all the passengers on board. Dr. David Grant (Kurt Russell) discovers however that this is not their true plan, they have a bomb on the plane that when dropped will release a large amount of nerve gas on detonation. So with the help of Lt. Colonel Austin Travis (Razzie nominated Steven Seagal), Captain Rat (John Leguizamo) and bomb expert Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt), Grant and the small United States Army Special Forces team get themselves on board, unnoticed, and try to save everyone. At the same time, hostages including plane flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry) follow the instructions of their kidnappers, while trying to find a way to get help or spoil their plan. Also starring Joe Morton as Sergeant 'Cappy' Matheny, B.D. Wong as Sergeant Louie, Len Cariou as Secretary of Defense Charles White, Andreas Katsulas as El Sayed Jaffa and J.T. Walsh as Senator Mavros. I was so in and out of the film, I wasn't dozing off, I was just doing other stuff at the same time, so I even missed how Seagal sacrifices himself, it didn't look all that engaging or exciting, but when I did pay attention, it had its very, very tiny moments, a fair action thriller. Okay!

    Suspenseful nail-biter with a good Cast and an Editor turned Director debuting with an Action Movie that has less Action than most but relies on tight claustrophobic conditions to propel the Story of perils on a plane hijacked by a nut-job. He is of the "Belief" that destroying millions and millions of Men, Women, and Children because they are different will somehow make the World a better place. Get the straight-jacket! Good ol' Planet Earth has contended with such Evil since forever and the only thing that has changed is the amount of time it takes to wipe out so many with so little planning by a deluded, brain washed Megalomaniac. This is a thrilling ride and is worth a view. Thankfully, there are minimum explosions, minimum automatic weapon fire, but a maximum of pulse pounding scenarios. Just a bit different and at the same time the same and that results in a Movie that is exciting Entertainment.

    An Islamist terror cell hijacks a trans-Atlantic flight . They demand the release of El Sayed Jaffa who is held in custody and a daring rescue mission led by special forces officer Colonel Austin Travis and academic Dr David Grant do their best to thwart the terrorist plan EXECUTIVE DECISION is a well worn clich&eacute;d tale of terrorist nutjobs bringing death and destruction to the United States and it's up to some good old stock characters to stop them . The special forces team is composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino and an oriental making up a fine cross section of the American public same as Hollywood as a violent street gang of thugs composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino ... There's also a stewardess who cometh the hour cometh the ballsy heroine and of course the bad guy is despite being an Arab with theocratic leanings is played by a well regarded British actor In other words this is a clich&eacute;d movie where no clich&eacute;d stone is left unturned and yet another clich&eacute; raises its ugly head . And yet despite this EXECUTIVE DECISION disguises the clich&eacute;s very well . What helps tremendously is the way it pulls the rug out from the audiences feet where early on when a character played by a very well known actor is killed off early on . David Suchet plays the chief villain in a way only British actors seem capable of by making Nagi Hassan if not a sophisticated multi-layered three dimensional baddie then certainly not a one dimensional parody the character could have been This is a thriller produced between DIE HARD and 9/11 and is obviously the sort of movie that wouldn't be produced today . It's a film that was produced simply as enthralling popcorn entertainment rather than portent warning but as popcorn entertainment it works very well and disguises the numerous clich&eacute;s throughout the plotting

    One of a number of airborne riffs on Die Hard to come out at the time - Air Force One among them. This is up there with Air Force One on the loopy scale, what with it's 'F-117X Remora' modified stealth fighter that would not look amiss if it was called 'Thunderbird 7'. While there's nothing particularly surprising about it, it does provide effective entertainment, and does a good job of ratcheting up the tension level. Kurt Russell is a hero of the Jack Ryan mould, an intelligence desk jockey out of his depth when thrust into a crisis. Despite his feelings about the film, Steven Seagal isn't too bad as the combat team leader. John Leguizamo is as you'd expect. Halle Berry always has our sympathies as the brave stewardess, while David Suchet makes a truly terrifying villain, who's just as quick to execute one of his own men as he is any of the passengers. In the end, it's nothing special, but action fans ought to check it out.

    Two incidents occur; at first unrelated, they will be connected to a terrifying plot to bomb "half the Eastern Seaboard" of the United States. First, a US undercover team fails to recover a supply of the nerve toxin DZ-5, recently stolen from the Russians. Second, the US captures the world's "most feared and wanted terrorist." Of course, Islamists are furious. Led by dastardly David Suchet (as Nagi Hassan), a gang of Arabs hijack "Oceanic Airlines" flight #343, an American 747 bound for Washington DC. The terrorists want their leader released, or they will shoot over 400 passengers, one-by-one... "Executive Decision" features a great stunt, amid the usual clich&eacute;s. Herein, a stealth aircraft attaches itself to the hijacked plane so heroic Kurt Russell (as David Grant) and a group can secretly get on board. A cool, workable, idea - though some of the other, more minor, stuff is implausible. Nobody steps on any probes (they could have said the plane has security cameras and tap into them)... Leading the crew are engaging John Leguizamo (as Carlos "Rat" Lopez), straw-chewing Oliver Platt (as Dennis Cahill) and wire expert Joe Morton (as Campbell "Cappy" Matheny). Strange castaway Steven Seagal (as Austin Travis) is included for "box office" appeal, but it's difficult to explain the presence of Donald Trump's (then) newest wife. Pretty flight attendant Halle Berry (as Jean) is helpful... The film maintains excitement very well, but there is some turbulence in the production. Pieces of film sometimes appear too loose and others seem missing. For example, a hijacker in disguise is suddenly transformed into reality, hair and make-up looking perfect; we see a shot of him before and the disguise after, but no shot establishing him offing the disguise (even if the disguised actor was a stand-in, something could have been done). You're often not sure where you are, but it's still an entertaining ride. ****** Executive Decision (3/15/96) Stuart Baird ~ Kurt Russell, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt

    One of a number of airborne riffs on Die Hard to come out at the time - Air Force One among them. This is up there with Air Force One on the loopy scale, what with it's 'F-117X Remora' modified stealth fighter that would not look amiss if it was called 'Thunderbird 7'. While there's nothing particularly surprising about it, it does provide effective entertainment, and does a good job of ratcheting up the tension level. Kurt Russell is a hero of the Jack Ryan mould, an intelligence desk jockey out of his depth when thrust into a crisis. Despite his feelings about the film, Steven Seagal isn't too bad as the combat team leader. John Leguizamo is as you'd expect. Halle Berry always has our sympathies as the brave stewardess, while David Suchet makes a truly terrifying villain, who's just as quick to execute one of his own men as he is any of the passengers. In the end, it's nothing special, but action fans ought to check it out.

    Two incidents occur; at first unrelated, they will be connected to a terrifying plot to bomb "half the Eastern Seaboard" of the United States. First, a US undercover team fails to recover a supply of the nerve toxin DZ-5, recently stolen from the Russians. Second, the US captures the world's "most feared and wanted terrorist." Of course, Islamists are furious. Led by dastardly David Suchet (as Nagi Hassan), a gang of Arabs hijack "Oceanic Airlines" flight #343, an American 747 bound for Washington DC. The terrorists want their leader released, or they will shoot over 400 passengers, one-by-one... "Executive Decision" features a great stunt, amid the usual clich&eacute;s. Herein, a stealth aircraft attaches itself to the hijacked plane so heroic Kurt Russell (as David Grant) and a group can secretly get on board. A cool, workable, idea - though some of the other, more minor, stuff is implausible. Nobody steps on any probes (they could have said the plane has security cameras and tap into them)... Leading the crew are engaging John Leguizamo (as Carlos "Rat" Lopez), straw-chewing Oliver Platt (as Dennis Cahill) and wire expert Joe Morton (as Campbell "Cappy" Matheny). Strange castaway Steven Seagal (as Austin Travis) is included for "box office" appeal, but it's difficult to explain the presence of Donald Trump's (then) newest wife. Pretty flight attendant Halle Berry (as Jean) is helpful... The film maintains excitement very well, but there is some turbulence in the production. Pieces of film sometimes appear too loose and others seem missing. For example, a hijacker in disguise is suddenly transformed into reality, hair and make-up looking perfect; we see a shot of him before and the disguise after, but no shot establishing him offing the disguise (even if the disguised actor was a stand-in, something could have been done). You're often not sure where you are, but it's still an entertaining ride. ****** Executive Decision (3/15/96) Stuart Baird ~ Kurt Russell, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt

    When terrorists hijack a 747 bound for Washington they demand the release of their group's leader who had recently been captured. Initial plans are to play ball with them until they land then deal with them but State Department analyst XXX Grant believes the terrorists are in position of a deadly nerve agent and their demands are just an excuse to get the plane in to Washington airspace. If this is correct there are only two options; blow the plane out of the sky or use a classified stealth plane to transfer an elite commando group led by Col. Travis onto the plane in midair! Grant goes along too as his knowledge of the terrorists may be needed. An accident mid-transfer leaves the team aboard the 747 with half their kit missing, no way to contact anybody and with important team members dead or injuredÂ… if they are to save everybody on board Grant will have to identify the lead terrorist and the person in charge of the bomb before the plane enters US airspace! This film has plenty of action and the times in between the action are very tense as the commandos could be discovered at any time as the move through the areas of the plane passengers never see. There are some major surprises including the death of somebody most viewers will expect to be one of the stars of the film! There are plenty of well known actors including Kurt Russell and Steven Seagal as Grant and Travis; Halle Berry as a helpful stewardess and David Suchet as the leader of the terrorists aboard the plane; other main characters are played by familiar faces too. The cast does a fine job and Director Stuart Baird keeps the tension high from start to finish. Inevitably there are a few clich&eacute; moments but one expects a few in films like this. If you like action thrillers then this one is well worth watching.

    Kurt Russell does it again! It is very rare to catch Kurt Russell making a bad film and it's no surprise to me that he makes this film just as exciting as the many others that he's done in the past. And it's not just him either; Russell is paired up with several other actors to make this movie good. Executive Decision (1996) is the story of when a small military group and a few civilians take on an impossible looking task when an airplane is hijacked by terrorists. There isn't much to say about Kurt Russell and his character, Dr. David Grant, because it's likable like any other character that he's done before. Because Grant's a civilian in this story, of course he's going to be much more nervous than his military counterparts. Two other civilians that play key roles in this story is engineer Dennis Cahil (Oliver Platt) and flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry). Platt is good making his character sound like he knows what he's talking about, until he's called upon to diffuse a bomb, but hey, I'd be nervous too if I was him. Halle Berry also plays her role quite accurately as a nervous but strong willed flight attendant. If the situation were for real, it would take a lot of guts to put herself in so much danger. John Leguizamo, BD Wong, Joe Morton, Whip Hubley and Steven Seagal play the military squad. All of which I commend for their believable and entertaining performances as troopers under the gun and under a lot of pressure. Even the actors who portrayed the terrorists did a good job at instilling fear in the plot. What specifically makes this film so good though is how continuously stressful the situation is and becomes as the plot runs it course. Plus, there are several times where the possibility of the covert operation being discovered by the terrorists. And if it's not this, it's the fact that there's the possibility of a bomb going off. In many peoples' opinion, the stakes are way too high and there are too many odds against them. And for a while, I was thinking that too! Adding to the suspense is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. In some ways it sounds like a premature attempt at the Small Soldiers (1998) theme, but either way it works well. My only complaint with Goldsmith is that he couldn't make one last track for the credits. Why? Which leads me to the problems I had with this film. The ending is good to this movie but the way it transitions in tone from high tension to relaxation is way too abrupt. I won't say much, because I don't want to give it away but how does playing a Frank Sinatra tune at the credits appropriate to the ending? It's like the main characters are just purposefully forgetting all the damage that occurred through the whole movie! Yeah,...everything's all happy-go-lucky. Then there's the whole issue with the innocent bystanders who die in this movie. Yes, this movie is rated R, not everyone lives (but I won't say who)! How did the Thomas brothers (Jim & John) forget to write in a scene where the people who were lost are given a respectful burial? Isn't that kind of important? And finally, if any viewer doesn't like constant whispering, then I would not recommend this film because for the most of the beginning, everyone's whispering. To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird. The suspense is really high in this film and all the actors play their parts really well. Just watch out for the ending, which seems a little out of place.

    A near actionless knock-off of 'Die Hard' in which intelligence analyst (Russell) and commando (Seagal) must sneak on board a high-jacked airliner to prevent the terrorists from detonating a bomb over Washington D.C. Meanwhile, the President is wondering whether or not he should avoid the risk altogether by having the plain shot down, civilians and all. It sounds exiting but it's really very uneventful. Apparenly, (spolier) Seagal's character was killed-off early because he was being a jerk on-set and everyone was tired of working with him. I guess you could call that an 'executive decision' on the part of the producer.

    This film has and incredibly far fletched plot. Right from the beginning of the production one sees technical gimmicks that somehow or other are too unbelievable. Not getting into the story I find it unbelievable that the jumbo jet takes off with Rolls Royce engines yet halfway across the Atlantic Ocean the jumbo is sporting Pratt and Whitney engines. That is quite a feat, being able to change engines on a heavy jet while in mid flight. For me that destroyed the credibility of this movie. No matter how good the rest of the special effects were this fatal flaw showed an oversight on the part of the technical consultant and is unbelievable for such a highly experienced director such as Stuart Baird.

    This film was amazing! All of the actors were brilliant and Kurt Russell should definitely stick to being a buisinessman who knows how to shoot. Also, David Suchet - seeing Hercules Poirot as a bad guy was undeniably a work of a genius. The storyline was great and realistic but now i'll get to the flaws. For starters Steven Seagal died during the epic mid-air transfer. :( That was their first mistake. It should never have happened. Next, with the amount of times Halle Berry had run-ins with Suchet she should have been shot through the head! Next, the simple fact that the terrorists took ages to check the service hatch was wrong. They should have checked straight away. And last but not least was the fiasco where the master terrorist got released from prison and put on a jet at the end. I don't object to that but when the pentagon found out that the plane had bee secured they should have immediately brought the plane back or shot it down. Anything to stop the terrorist from escaping. Anywy don't let the bad deter you from watching this film. Despite the flaws it was still a satisfyingly good watch. P.S. I know there are spoilers but they were necessary.

    I'm afraid to say that I didn't full attention to this film at all when it was on, but to be honest I'm really not that bothered, from what I could gather it looked a little dull for a film rated three stars out of five, from director Stuart Baird (U.S. Marshals, Star Trek: Nemesis). Basically terrorists led by Nagi Hassan (David Suchet) have hijacked a plane, flight 747 bound from Athens to Washington D.C., and they are demanding the release of their leader from prison in exchange for all the passengers on board. Dr. David Grant (Kurt Russell) discovers however that this is not their true plan, they have a bomb on the plane that when dropped will release a large amount of nerve gas on detonation. So with the help of Lt. Colonel Austin Travis (Razzie nominated Steven Seagal), Captain Rat (John Leguizamo) and bomb expert Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt), Grant and the small United States Army Special Forces team get themselves on board, unnoticed, and try to save everyone. At the same time, hostages including plane flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry) follow the instructions of their kidnappers, while trying to find a way to get help or spoil their plan. Also starring Joe Morton as Sergeant 'Cappy' Matheny, B.D. Wong as Sergeant Louie, Len Cariou as Secretary of Defense Charles White, Andreas Katsulas as El Sayed Jaffa and J.T. Walsh as Senator Mavros. I was so in and out of the film, I wasn't dozing off, I was just doing other stuff at the same time, so I even missed how Seagal sacrifices himself, it didn't look all that engaging or exciting, but when I did pay attention, it had its very, very tiny moments, a fair action thriller. Okay!

    Suspenseful nail-biter with a good Cast and an Editor turned Director debuting with an Action Movie that has less Action than most but relies on tight claustrophobic conditions to propel the Story of perils on a plane hijacked by a nut-job. He is of the "Belief" that destroying millions and millions of Men, Women, and Children because they are different will somehow make the World a better place. Get the straight-jacket! Good ol' Planet Earth has contended with such Evil since forever and the only thing that has changed is the amount of time it takes to wipe out so many with so little planning by a deluded, brain washed Megalomaniac. This is a thrilling ride and is worth a view. Thankfully, there are minimum explosions, minimum automatic weapon fire, but a maximum of pulse pounding scenarios. Just a bit different and at the same time the same and that results in a Movie that is exciting Entertainment.

    An Islamist terror cell hijacks a trans-Atlantic flight . They demand the release of El Sayed Jaffa who is held in custody and a daring rescue mission led by special forces officer Colonel Austin Travis and academic Dr David Grant do their best to thwart the terrorist plan EXECUTIVE DECISION is a well worn clich&eacute;d tale of terrorist nutjobs bringing death and destruction to the United States and it's up to some good old stock characters to stop them . The special forces team is composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino and an oriental making up a fine cross section of the American public same as Hollywood as a violent street gang of thugs composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino ... There's also a stewardess who cometh the hour cometh the ballsy heroine and of course the bad guy is despite being an Arab with theocratic leanings is played by a well regarded British actor In other words this is a clich&eacute;d movie where no clich&eacute;d stone is left unturned and yet another clich&eacute; raises its ugly head . And yet despite this EXECUTIVE DECISION disguises the clich&eacute;s very well . What helps tremendously is the way it pulls the rug out from the audiences feet where early on when a character played by a very well known actor is killed off early on . David Suchet plays the chief villain in a way only British actors seem capable of by making Nagi Hassan if not a sophisticated multi-layered three dimensional baddie then certainly not a one dimensional parody the character could have been This is a thriller produced between DIE HARD and 9/11 and is obviously the sort of movie that wouldn't be produced today . It's a film that was produced simply as enthralling popcorn entertainment rather than portent warning but as popcorn entertainment it works very well and disguises the numerous clich&eacute;s throughout the plotting

Dr. David Grant (Kurt Russell) discovers however that this is not their true plan, they have a bomb on the plane that when dropped will release a large amount of nerve gas on detonation. So with the help of Lt. Colonel Austin Travis (Razzie nominated Steven Seagal), Captain Rat (John Leguizamo) and bomb expert Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt), Grant and the small United States Army Special Forces team get themselves on board, unnoticed, and try to save everyone. At the same time, hostages including plane flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry) follow the instructions of their kidnappers, while trying to find a way to get help or spoil their plan. Also starring Joe Morton as Sergeant 'Cappy' Matheny, B.D. Wong as Sergeant Louie, Len Cariou as Secretary of Defense Charles White, Andreas Katsulas as El Sayed Jaffa and J.T. Walsh as Senator Mavros. I was so in and out of the film, I wasn't dozing off, I was just doing other stuff at the same time, so I even missed how Seagal sacrifices himself, it didn't look all that engaging or exciting, but when I did pay attention, it had its very, very tiny moments, a fair action thriller. Okay!

    Suspenseful nail-biter with a good Cast and an Editor turned Director debuting with an Action Movie that has less Action than most but relies on tight claustrophobic conditions to propel the Story of perils on a plane hijacked by a nut-job. He is of the "Belief" that destroying millions and millions of Men, Women, and Children because they are different will somehow make the World a better place. Get the straight-jacket! Good ol' Planet Earth has contended with such Evil since forever and the only thing that has changed is the amount of time it takes to wipe out so many with so little planning by a deluded, brain washed Megalomaniac. This is a thrilling ride and is worth a view. Thankfully, there are minimum explosions, minimum automatic weapon fire, but a maximum of pulse pounding scenarios. Just a bit different and at the same time the same and that results in a Movie that is exciting Entertainment.

    An Islamist terror cell hijacks a trans-Atlantic flight . They demand the release of El Sayed Jaffa who is held in custody and a daring rescue mission led by special forces officer Colonel Austin Travis and academic Dr David Grant do their best to thwart the terrorist plan EXECUTIVE DECISION is a well worn clich&eacute;d tale of terrorist nutjobs bringing death and destruction to the United States and it's up to some good old stock characters to stop them . The special forces team is composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino and an oriental making up a fine cross section of the American public same as Hollywood as a violent street gang of thugs composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino ... There's also a stewardess who cometh the hour cometh the ballsy heroine and of course the bad guy is despite being an Arab with theocratic leanings is played by a well regarded British actor In other words this is a clich&eacute;d movie where no clich&eacute;d stone is left unturned and yet another clich&eacute; raises its ugly head . And yet despite this EXECUTIVE DECISION disguises the clich&eacute;s very well . What helps tremendously is the way it pulls the rug out from the audiences feet where early on when a character played by a very well known actor is killed off early on . David Suchet plays the chief villain in a way only British actors seem capable of by making Nagi Hassan if not a sophisticated multi-layered three dimensional baddie then certainly not a one dimensional parody the character could have been This is a thriller produced between DIE HARD and 9/11 and is obviously the sort of movie that wouldn't be produced today . It's a film that was produced simply as enthralling popcorn entertainment rather than portent warning but as popcorn entertainment it works very well and disguises the numerous clich&eacute;s throughout the plotting

    One of a number of airborne riffs on Die Hard to come out at the time - Air Force One among them. This is up there with Air Force One on the loopy scale, what with it's 'F-117X Remora' modified stealth fighter that would not look amiss if it was called 'Thunderbird 7'. While there's nothing particularly surprising about it, it does provide effective entertainment, and does a good job of ratcheting up the tension level. Kurt Russell is a hero of the Jack Ryan mould, an intelligence desk jockey out of his depth when thrust into a crisis. Despite his feelings about the film, Steven Seagal isn't too bad as the combat team leader. John Leguizamo is as you'd expect. Halle Berry always has our sympathies as the brave stewardess, while David Suchet makes a truly terrifying villain, who's just as quick to execute one of his own men as he is any of the passengers. In the end, it's nothing special, but action fans ought to check it out.

    Two incidents occur; at first unrelated, they will be connected to a terrifying plot to bomb "half the Eastern Seaboard" of the United States. First, a US undercover team fails to recover a supply of the nerve toxin DZ-5, recently stolen from the Russians. Second, the US captures the world's "most feared and wanted terrorist." Of course, Islamists are furious. Led by dastardly David Suchet (as Nagi Hassan), a gang of Arabs hijack "Oceanic Airlines" flight #343, an American 747 bound for Washington DC. The terrorists want their leader released, or they will shoot over 400 passengers, one-by-one... "Executive Decision" features a great stunt, amid the usual clich&eacute;s. Herein, a stealth aircraft attaches itself to the hijacked plane so heroic Kurt Russell (as David Grant) and a group can secretly get on board. A cool, workable, idea - though some of the other, more minor, stuff is implausible. Nobody steps on any probes (they could have said the plane has security cameras and tap into them)... Leading the crew are engaging John Leguizamo (as Carlos "Rat" Lopez), straw-chewing Oliver Platt (as Dennis Cahill) and wire expert Joe Morton (as Campbell "Cappy" Matheny). Strange castaway Steven Seagal (as Austin Travis) is included for "box office" appeal, but it's difficult to explain the presence of Donald Trump's (then) newest wife. Pretty flight attendant Halle Berry (as Jean) is helpful... The film maintains excitement very well, but there is some turbulence in the production. Pieces of film sometimes appear too loose and others seem missing. For example, a hijacker in disguise is suddenly transformed into reality, hair and make-up looking perfect; we see a shot of him before and the disguise after, but no shot establishing him offing the disguise (even if the disguised actor was a stand-in, something could have been done). You're often not sure where you are, but it's still an entertaining ride. ****** Executive Decision (3/15/96) Stuart Baird ~ Kurt Russell, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt

    When terrorists hijack a 747 bound for Washington they demand the release of their group's leader who had recently been captured. Initial plans are to play ball with them until they land then deal with them but State Department analyst XXX Grant believes the terrorists are in position of a deadly nerve agent and their demands are just an excuse to get the plane in to Washington airspace. If this is correct there are only two options; blow the plane out of the sky or use a classified stealth plane to transfer an elite commando group led by Col. Travis onto the plane in midair! Grant goes along too as his knowledge of the terrorists may be needed. An accident mid-transfer leaves the team aboard the 747 with half their kit missing, no way to contact anybody and with important team members dead or injuredÂ… if they are to save everybody on board Grant will have to identify the lead terrorist and the person in charge of the bomb before the plane enters US airspace! This film has plenty of action and the times in between the action are very tense as the commandos could be discovered at any time as the move through the areas of the plane passengers never see. There are some major surprises including the death of somebody most viewers will expect to be one of the stars of the film! There are plenty of well known actors including Kurt Russell and Steven Seagal as Grant and Travis; Halle Berry as a helpful stewardess and David Suchet as the leader of the terrorists aboard the plane; other main characters are played by familiar faces too. The cast does a fine job and Director Stuart Baird keeps the tension high from start to finish. Inevitably there are a few clich&eacute; moments but one expects a few in films like this. If you like action thrillers then this one is well worth watching.

    Kurt Russell does it again! It is very rare to catch Kurt Russell making a bad film and it's no surprise to me that he makes this film just as exciting as the many others that he's done in the past. And it's not just him either; Russell is paired up with several other actors to make this movie good. Executive Decision (1996) is the story of when a small military group and a few civilians take on an impossible looking task when an airplane is hijacked by terrorists. There isn't much to say about Kurt Russell and his character, Dr. David Grant, because it's likable like any other character that he's done before. Because Grant's a civilian in this story, of course he's going to be much more nervous than his military counterparts. Two other civilians that play key roles in this story is engineer Dennis Cahil (Oliver Platt) and flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry). Platt is good making his character sound like he knows what he's talking about, until he's called upon to diffuse a bomb, but hey, I'd be nervous too if I was him. Halle Berry also plays her role quite accurately as a nervous but strong willed flight attendant. If the situation were for real, it would take a lot of guts to put herself in so much danger. John Leguizamo, BD Wong, Joe Morton, Whip Hubley and Steven Seagal play the military squad. All of which I commend for their believable and entertaining performances as troopers under the gun and under a lot of pressure. Even the actors who portrayed the terrorists did a good job at instilling fear in the plot. What specifically makes this film so good though is how continuously stressful the situation is and becomes as the plot runs it course. Plus, there are several times where the possibility of the covert operation being discovered by the terrorists. And if it's not this, it's the fact that there's the possibility of a bomb going off. In many peoples' opinion, the stakes are way too high and there are too many odds against them. And for a while, I was thinking that too! Adding to the suspense is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. In some ways it sounds like a premature attempt at the Small Soldiers (1998) theme, but either way it works well. My only complaint with Goldsmith is that he couldn't make one last track for the credits. Why? Which leads me to the problems I had with this film. The ending is good to this movie but the way it transitions in tone from high tension to relaxation is way too abrupt. I won't say much, because I don't want to give it away but how does playing a Frank Sinatra tune at the credits appropriate to the ending? It's like the main characters are just purposefully forgetting all the damage that occurred through the whole movie! Yeah,...everything's all happy-go-lucky. Then there's the whole issue with the innocent bystanders who die in this movie. Yes, this movie is rated R, not everyone lives (but I won't say who)! How did the Thomas brothers (Jim & John) forget to write in a scene where the people who were lost are given a respectful burial? Isn't that kind of important? And finally, if any viewer doesn't like constant whispering, then I would not recommend this film because for the most of the beginning, everyone's whispering. To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird. The suspense is really high in this film and all the actors play their parts really well. Just watch out for the ending, which seems a little out of place.

    A near actionless knock-off of 'Die Hard' in which intelligence analyst (Russell) and commando (Seagal) must sneak on board a high-jacked airliner to prevent the terrorists from detonating a bomb over Washington D.C. Meanwhile, the President is wondering whether or not he should avoid the risk altogether by having the plain shot down, civilians and all. It sounds exiting but it's really very uneventful. Apparenly, (spolier) Seagal's character was killed-off early because he was being a jerk on-set and everyone was tired of working with him. I guess you could call that an 'executive decision' on the part of the producer.

    This film has and incredibly far fletched plot. Right from the beginning of the production one sees technical gimmicks that somehow or other are too unbelievable. Not getting into the story I find it unbelievable that the jumbo jet takes off with Rolls Royce engines yet halfway across the Atlantic Ocean the jumbo is sporting Pratt and Whitney engines. That is quite a feat, being able to change engines on a heavy jet while in mid flight. For me that destroyed the credibility of this movie. No matter how good the rest of the special effects were this fatal flaw showed an oversight on the part of the technical consultant and is unbelievable for such a highly experienced director such as Stuart Baird.

    This film was amazing! All of the actors were brilliant and Kurt Russell should definitely stick to being a buisinessman who knows how to shoot. Also, David Suchet - seeing Hercules Poirot as a bad guy was undeniably a work of a genius. The storyline was great and realistic but now i'll get to the flaws. For starters Steven Seagal died during the epic mid-air transfer. :( That was their first mistake. It should never have happened. Next, with the amount of times Halle Berry had run-ins with Suchet she should have been shot through the head! Next, the simple fact that the terrorists took ages to check the service hatch was wrong. They should have checked straight away. And last but not least was the fiasco where the master terrorist got released from prison and put on a jet at the end. I don't object to that but when the pentagon found out that the plane had bee secured they should have immediately brought the plane back or shot it down. Anything to stop the terrorist from escaping. Anywy don't let the bad deter you from watching this film. Despite the flaws it was still a satisfyingly good watch. P.S. I know there are spoilers but they were necessary.

To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird. The suspense is really high in this film and all the actors play their parts really well. Just watch out for the ending, which seems a little out of place.

    A near actionless knock-off of 'Die Hard' in which intelligence analyst (Russell) and commando (Seagal) must sneak on board a high-jacked airliner to prevent the terrorists from detonating a bomb over Washington D.C. Meanwhile, the President is wondering whether or not he should avoid the risk altogether by having the plain shot down, civilians and all. It sounds exiting but it's really very uneventful. Apparenly, (spolier) Seagal's character was killed-off early because he was being a jerk on-set and everyone was tired of working with him. I guess you could call that an 'executive decision' on the part of the producer.

    This film has and incredibly far fletched plot. Right from the beginning of the production one sees technical gimmicks that somehow or other are too unbelievable. Not getting into the story I find it unbelievable that the jumbo jet takes off with Rolls Royce engines yet halfway across the Atlantic Ocean the jumbo is sporting Pratt and Whitney engines. That is quite a feat, being able to change engines on a heavy jet while in mid flight. For me that destroyed the credibility of this movie. No matter how good the rest of the special effects were this fatal flaw showed an oversight on the part of the technical consultant and is unbelievable for such a highly experienced director such as Stuart Baird.

    This film was amazing! All of the actors were brilliant and Kurt Russell should definitely stick to being a buisinessman who knows how to shoot. Also, David Suchet - seeing Hercules Poirot as a bad guy was undeniably a work of a genius. The storyline was great and realistic but now i'll get to the flaws. For starters Steven Seagal died during the epic mid-air transfer. :( That was their first mistake. It should never have happened. Next, with the amount of times Halle Berry had run-ins with Suchet she should have been shot through the head! Next, the simple fact that the terrorists took ages to check the service hatch was wrong. They should have checked straight away. And last but not least was the fiasco where the master terrorist got released from prison and put on a jet at the end. I don't object to that but when the pentagon found out that the plane had bee secured they should have immediately brought the plane back or shot it down. Anything to stop the terrorist from escaping. Anywy don't let the bad deter you from watching this film. Despite the flaws it was still a satisfyingly good watch. P.S. I know there are spoilers but they were necessary.

    I'm afraid to say that I didn't full attention to this film at all when it was on, but to be honest I'm really not that bothered, from what I could gather it looked a little dull for a film rated three stars out of five, from director Stuart Baird (U.S. Marshals, Star Trek: Nemesis). Basically terrorists led by Nagi Hassan (David Suchet) have hijacked a plane, flight 747 bound from Athens to Washington D.C., and they are demanding the release of their leader from prison in exchange for all the passengers on board. Dr. David Grant (Kurt Russell) discovers however that this is not their true plan, they have a bomb on the plane that when dropped will release a large amount of nerve gas on detonation. So with the help of Lt. Colonel Austin Travis (Razzie nominated Steven Seagal), Captain Rat (John Leguizamo) and bomb expert Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt), Grant and the small United States Army Special Forces team get themselves on board, unnoticed, and try to save everyone. At the same time, hostages including plane flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry) follow the instructions of their kidnappers, while trying to find a way to get help or spoil their plan. Also starring Joe Morton as Sergeant 'Cappy' Matheny, B.D. Wong as Sergeant Louie, Len Cariou as Secretary of Defense Charles White, Andreas Katsulas as El Sayed Jaffa and J.T. Walsh as Senator Mavros. I was so in and out of the film, I wasn't dozing off, I was just doing other stuff at the same time, so I even missed how Seagal sacrifices himself, it didn't look all that engaging or exciting, but when I did pay attention, it had its very, very tiny moments, a fair action thriller. Okay!

    Suspenseful nail-biter with a good Cast and an Editor turned Director debuting with an Action Movie that has less Action than most but relies on tight claustrophobic conditions to propel the Story of perils on a plane hijacked by a nut-job. He is of the "Belief" that destroying millions and millions of Men, Women, and Children because they are different will somehow make the World a better place. Get the straight-jacket! Good ol' Planet Earth has contended with such Evil since forever and the only thing that has changed is the amount of time it takes to wipe out so many with so little planning by a deluded, brain washed Megalomaniac. This is a thrilling ride and is worth a view. Thankfully, there are minimum explosions, minimum automatic weapon fire, but a maximum of pulse pounding scenarios. Just a bit different and at the same time the same and that results in a Movie that is exciting Entertainment.

    An Islamist terror cell hijacks a trans-Atlantic flight . They demand the release of El Sayed Jaffa who is held in custody and a daring rescue mission led by special forces officer Colonel Austin Travis and academic Dr David Grant do their best to thwart the terrorist plan EXECUTIVE DECISION is a well worn clich&eacute;d tale of terrorist nutjobs bringing death and destruction to the United States and it's up to some good old stock characters to stop them . The special forces team is composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino and an oriental making up a fine cross section of the American public same as Hollywood as a violent street gang of thugs composed of a white guy , a black guy , a Latino ... There's also a stewardess who cometh the hour cometh the ballsy heroine and of course the bad guy is despite being an Arab with theocratic leanings is played by a well regarded British actor In other words this is a clich&eacute;d movie where no clich&eacute;d stone is left unturned and yet another clich&eacute; raises its ugly head . And yet despite this EXECUTIVE DECISION disguises the clich&eacute;s very well . What helps tremendously is the way it pulls the rug out from the audiences feet where early on when a character played by a very well known actor is killed off early on . David Suchet plays the chief villain in a way only British actors seem capable of by making Nagi Hassan if not a sophisticated multi-layered three dimensional baddie then certainly not a one dimensional parody the character could have been This is a thriller produced between DIE HARD and 9/11 and is obviously the sort of movie that wouldn't be produced today . It's a film that was produced simply as enthralling popcorn entertainment rather than portent warning but as popcorn entertainment it works very well and disguises the numerous clich&eacute;s throughout the plotting

    One of a number of airborne riffs on Die Hard to come out at the time - Air Force One among them. This is up there with Air Force One on the loopy scale, what with it's 'F-117X Remora' modified stealth fighter that would not look amiss if it was called 'Thunderbird 7'. While there's nothing particularly surprising about it, it does provide effective entertainment, and does a good job of ratcheting up the tension level. Kurt Russell is a hero of the Jack Ryan mould, an intelligence desk jockey out of his depth when thrust into a crisis. Despite his feelings about the film, Steven Seagal isn't too bad as the combat team leader. John Leguizamo is as you'd expect. Halle Berry always has our sympathies as the brave stewardess, while David Suchet makes a truly terrifying villain, who's just as quick to execute one of his own men as he is any of the passengers. In the end, it's nothing special, but action fans ought to check it out.

    Two incidents occur; at first unrelated, they will be connected to a terrifying plot to bomb "half the Eastern Seaboard" of the United States. First, a US undercover team fails to recover a supply of the nerve toxin DZ-5, recently stolen from the Russians. Second, the US captures the world's "most feared and wanted terrorist." Of course, Islamists are furious. Led by dastardly David Suchet (as Nagi Hassan), a gang of Arabs hijack "Oceanic Airlines" flight #343, an American 747 bound for Washington DC. The terrorists want their leader released, or they will shoot over 400 passengers, one-by-one... "Executive Decision" features a great stunt, amid the usual clich&eacute;s. Herein, a stealth aircraft attaches itself to the hijacked plane so heroic Kurt Russell (as David Grant) and a group can secretly get on board. A cool, workable, idea - though some of the other, more minor, stuff is implausible. Nobody steps on any probes (they could have said the plane has security cameras and tap into them)... Leading the crew are engaging John Leguizamo (as Carlos "Rat" Lopez), straw-chewing Oliver Platt (as Dennis Cahill) and wire expert Joe Morton (as Campbell "Cappy" Matheny). Strange castaway Steven Seagal (as Austin Travis) is included for "box office" appeal, but it's difficult to explain the presence of Donald Trump's (then) newest wife. Pretty flight attendant Halle Berry (as Jean) is helpful... The film maintains excitement very well, but there is some turbulence in the production. Pieces of film sometimes appear too loose and others seem missing. For example, a hijacker in disguise is suddenly transformed into reality, hair and make-up looking perfect; we see a shot of him before and the disguise after, but no shot establishing him offing the disguise (even if the disguised actor was a stand-in, something could have been done). You're often not sure where you are, but it's still an entertaining ride. ****** Executive Decision (3/15/96) Stuart Baird ~ Kurt Russell, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt

    When terrorists hijack a 747 bound for Washington they demand the release of their group's leader who had recently been captured. Initial plans are to play ball with them until they land then deal with them but State Department analyst XXX Grant believes the terrorists are in position of a deadly nerve agent and their demands are just an excuse to get the plane in to Washington airspace. If this is correct there are only two options; blow the plane out of the sky or use a classified stealth plane to transfer an elite commando group led by Col. Travis onto the plane in midair! Grant goes along too as his knowledge of the terrorists may be needed. An accident mid-transfer leaves the team aboard the 747 with half their kit missing, no way to contact anybody and with important team members dead or injuredÂ… if they are to save everybody on board Grant will have to identify the lead terrorist and the person in charge of the bomb before the plane enters US airspace! This film has plenty of action and the times in between the action are very tense as the commandos could be discovered at any time as the move through the areas of the plane passengers never see. There are some major surprises including the death of somebody most viewers will expect to be one of the stars of the film! There are plenty of well known actors including Kurt Russell and Steven Seagal as Grant and Travis; Halle Berry as a helpful stewardess and David Suchet as the leader of the terrorists aboard the plane; other main characters are played by familiar faces too. The cast does a fine job and Director Stuart Baird keeps the tension high from start to finish. Inevitably there are a few clich&eacute; moments but one expects a few in films like this. If you like action thrillers then this one is well worth watching.

    Kurt Russell does it again! It is very rare to catch Kurt Russell making a bad film and it's no surprise to me that he makes this film just as exciting as the many others that he's done in the past. And it's not just him either; Russell is paired up with several other actors to make this movie good. Executive Decision (1996) is the story of when a small military group and a few civilians take on an impossible looking task when an airplane is hijacked by terrorists. There isn't much to say about Kurt Russell and his character, Dr. David Grant, because it's likable like any other character that he's done before. Because Grant's a civilian in this story, of course he's going to be much more nervous than his military counterparts. Two other civilians that play key roles in this story is engineer Dennis Cahil (Oliver Platt) and flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry). Platt is good making his character sound like he knows what he's talking about, until he's called upon to diffuse a bomb, but hey, I'd be nervous too if I was him. Halle Berry also plays her role quite accurately as a nervous but strong willed flight attendant. If the situation were for real, it would take a lot of guts to put herself in so much danger. John Leguizamo, BD Wong, Joe Morton, Whip Hubley and Steven Seagal play the military squad. All of which I commend for their believable and entertaining performances as troopers under the gun and under a lot of pressure. Even the actors who portrayed the terrorists did a good job at instilling fear in the plot. What specifically makes this film so good though is how continuously stressful the situation is and becomes as the plot runs it course. Plus, there are several times where the possibility of the covert operation being discovered by the terrorists. And if it's not this, it's the fact that there's the possibility of a bomb going off. In many peoples' opinion, the stakes are way too high and there are too many odds against them. And for a while, I was thinking that too! Adding to the suspense is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. In some ways it sounds like a premature attempt at the Small Soldiers (1998) theme, but either way it works well. My only complaint with Goldsmith is that he couldn't make one last track for the credits. Why? Which leads me to the problems I had with this film. The ending is good to this movie but the way it transitions in tone from high tension to relaxation is way too abrupt. I won't say much, because I don't want to give it away but how does playing a Frank Sinatra tune at the credits appropriate to the ending? It's like the main characters are just purposefully forgetting all the damage that occurred through the whole movie! Yeah,...everything's all happy-go-lucky. Then there's the whole issue with the innocent bystanders who die in this movie. Yes, this movie is rated R, not everyone lives (but I won't say who)! How did the Thomas brothers (Jim & John) forget to write in a scene where the people who were lost are given a respectful burial? Isn't that kind of important? And finally, if any viewer doesn't like constant whispering, then I would not recommend this film because for the most of the beginning, everyone's whispering. To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird.
