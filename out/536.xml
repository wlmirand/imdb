    Amazing realistic account of a girl who loses her mother but knows that she lives forever. Everyone has their own experiences with God and their own doubts, and she is passed back and forth a little, between believers and non-believers, most of which stand against her at some point. But her faith stays true to herself... ...and she eventually gets to get on with her life. Really realistic portrayal of how God communicates with different people and how some believers in God don't accept that and yet some non-believers can. From my own real life experiences I can confirm this to be possibly a completely true story, even the ending. And how believing it can leave you at odds with what the world might believe. Tried not to spoil the film for you, so watch it and be happy!

    I can't believe this came out 13 years ago. I feel like I just read the raves about the central performance like... four years ago. I've been meaning to see it. The movie concerns itself with how a four year old deals with the death of her mother. As anyone can tell you, the main child performance is excellent and remarkable. As hard as it is for an adult to come to terms with death, it must be heartbreaking to watch your child attempt to deal with it. But the movie has some big problems. I was surprised that after the early scenes which have at most one or two other actors in them, that adults go missing for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, this leaves the movie to present a certain type of "all children" scene over and over. For about ninety-five percent of its running time, toddling children are shown playing and hopelessly trying to make sense of death. It stays in that place for just too long. 40 minutes of the kids trying to comprehend super-natural rules for the dead, feels like an hour and a half. The kids can offer no insight; just verisimilitude, a lonely conceit that requires some support. For most of its length, Ponette is crying or confused. It just doesn't develop. I wish I could have seen Ponette interact with adults around her, in even the most rudimentary plot. Who are these awful parents who leave a toddler to fend for herself in wrestling with death? Wherever the movie goes, there is no shaking its belief that the answer to its dramatic problem is more talking. Having chosen such a small scale to encounter this material, it's not a surprise when the movie has no ending. It culminates in a gratuitous, conventional and sentimental wish-fulfillment scene filmed literally; it is not a fantasy as some insist, because a child's mind cannot manufacture the details we witness of her mothers return. It's just cheap. Both Spirit of the Beehive and The 400 Blows go more interesting places with material concerning childhood.

    It's evident and it deserves to be mentioned. When Jacques Doillon films children (un Sac De Billes, 1975) or teenagers (la Dr&ocirc;lesse, 1979, Le Petit Criminel, 1990), it's what he does best and especially when he pores over the dark sides of childhood and adolescence like rejection, misunderstanding, lack of love or the death of dear close relatives. "Ponette" revolves around the latest of these things. This cute 4 year old little girl lost her mother (Marie Trintignant,a sinister omen for her tragic fate some years later) and is persuaded she will see her again. So, she embarks on a long waiting which makes her father (Xavier Beauvois) and the grown-ups incensed. Her aunt (Claire Nebout) tries to provide her solace with the help of religious creeds but does she really believe in them? At the start of a new school year, she is sent at boarding school with her cousins and in a small church, asks God to talk to her mother. Then, in a graveyard in front of her mother's grave, a miracle happens. The first thing that springs to mind after the viewing is that you would like to hail Doillon for the remarkable work he has provided with the children. He said that he listened many conversations between children for months before rewriting them in dialogs and that's the main reason why his film has a larger than life vibe. Sometimes, you even wonder if you don't watch a documentary. Working with children on a film set is very hard to do but it's evident here that Doillon did everything possible to prepare his very young actors mentally to his cinematographic demands. So, little Victoire Thivisol and her partners really live their texts and it's the world perceived with children's eyes that is one of the real motors of the film. In another extent, Doillon walks away with the honors of a tricky topic: how can the life of a beloved human being can be perceived by her children? The Scottish Peter Mullan will bring his own answer in his moody "Orphans" (1997) and here, Ponette thinks she will see her mother again because she is seduced by the religious tenets her aunt tells to her. And when her mother appears beside her in the graveyard, it's a real foray into the fantastic without the unpleasant impression of a break in tone because the little girl is the only one to experiment this. During their short moment together her mother tells her: "I won't be able to stay with you but before I definitely leave, promise me one thing: don't complain, savor life as much as you can". We aren't very far from one of the key lines in John Frankenheimer's "Birdman of Alcatraz" (1962): "the first duty of life is to live" and it's the message Doillon left in his work. Ponette is bound to have understood the lesson and to follow this piece of advice. Perhaps you will keep it in your heart too after the viewing. So, from a murky starting point, Doillon manages to create a piece of work with a startling realism and an uplifting message. If you're sensitive to these features, "Ponette" will leave you elated. Highly recommended and I would advise you to watch it several times because very young children are often difficult to decipher in their lines. So, be patient and you will be rewarded.

    This is one of my favorite films of all time. It deals in a beautiful and complete manner with the way children perceive and process grief. The child in the lead role, Victoria Thivisol is astonishing and the rest of the cast are intuitive, strong, and poignant. The director is adept at letting the children in the film express the nuances of childhood: tenderness, confusion, mean-spiritedness, trust, humor, and deep sadness. This is a difficult and beautiful film to watch but please trust me when I say that it is a complete circle...it doesn't strand the viewer in a world of grief. This film is a gorgeous, difficult, complex poem.

    I have wanted to see this movie for a very long time. At the time it was released, my own Mother had suddenly died and I knew that it would have been too intense for me to watch. Now, it is almost 11 years later and I have finally watched it and this is quite simply one of the most true to life portrayals of grief and the journey it becomes for really anyone. I was Ponettes age when my father died and I can completely relate to her reactions, her agony and the confusion she portrayed. I can remember asking constantly when Daddy was coming back and not really accepting the answers that people were telling me. I also recall praying and talking to my father when I was alone in my room, begging him to come back and see me when no one else was around. I even had a dream about my father that was amazingly close to Ponettes interaction with her mother. This rang so true for me that I couldn't believe the writer of this story connected things in such a realistic way. Victoire Thivisol is shockingly real in this role. I cannot believe she was only 4 years old when this was filmed! It's a fascinating study of a shields emotional response to such a tragic event and quite honestly, I am at a total loss of words as to how to describe the power of this movie. I can only tell you that if you are looking for something intense and engrossing, this would be your movie. I really appreciated the feeling it left me with at the end too.....that life is not always easy and predictable but that humans are remarkably resilient beings who can actually grow in wonderful ways from the events that challenge us the most.

    This is a beautiful film. Watching it now as an adult I understand that there may have been some question of abuse. How can a little child know the difference between what's real and what's not to such an extent? It is truly moving to watch her cry in the prayer scene. Whatever your thoughts about whether or not this child should have been directed to perform this role, you cannot deny that it is a profoundly affecting portrait of childhood grief. A lot of people have complained that the ending is not conclusive enough, but I for one thought it was perfect. In life, things aren't usually wrapped up in a neat little package. All the actors in this film - especially the children - do an amazing job. One of my favorite films for many years.

    This movie is fantastic. What you can get from watching this movie cannot be described, which is a sort of power you can feel, which is something pure that grown-ups have lost. It's been ten years since its release. But it's still powerful when I watch it today. My hear is grabbed by the little girl. She is confused by her mother's death; she doesn't accept the reality; she believes she would see the mom again. She lives in pain which others are not able to understand. No one understands her; no one can help her; her father even thinks she's crazy. But what she feels and expects is precious, which has been lost by adults. Victoire Thivisol's acting is incredible. I never thought a 4-year-old could perform at such a level. She's great.

    Ponette is the story of a young French girl (4 years old) who's mother suddenly dies. It's a tough situation to explain to someone this young what exactly that means, and even more so when it's someone so close to them. The father, unsure of how to explain to Ponette that her mom is in fact, not coming back, and unable to convince her that the visions she keeps having of her mother being around every now and then, he sends her away for a while to live with friends and to cope with her loss as best as the adults and young friends around her can help her do. Victoire Thivisol, as the young Ponette, does a great job. I hadn't thought about it before that, as another view points out, this was not the fake sorrow of an actress with glycerine tears and such, all of the performance was real. And, although the story is interesting in that you see how a young kid might actually react to the death of someone they know and love, and how others might help them to cope with that, I was annoyed that about three quarters of the movie was Ponette crying over one thing or another. I suppose this is quite unsympathetic on my part to think that, damn, this kid is crying again? In all, I say that this film is for an audience that particularly enjoys its emotional dramas. Ponette has a lot to offer there. For others, the story may become either repetitive or just altogether dull to sit through, as at least one viewer has already expressed.

    It is absolutely amazing to see the star of Ponette as she acts. This child appears to be about four years-old and gives an incredible performance. The only problem is, that the script itself is a bit flat and my wife and I kept wondering "where is the father--why did he abandon this little girl?!" This and many other unanswered questions bothered me throughout the film. In addition, although the subject matter is novel (a very young child searching to understand her mother's death), it just stopped being interesting after a while. Then, when the movie did change tone at the very end, it became pretty weird, though not entirely unsatisfying. Overall, the acting is fine but it just didn't arouse my interest.

    Although I found this to be one of the most affecting films that I have seen, I was, nevertheless, astounded at the real depth of feeling shown by the young children in this film. Victoire Thivisol carries absolute sincerity in her portrayal of the recently bereaved young girl, with a realism beyond belief when one considers her tender age. The other children also played their parts with a conviction that would be considered commendable in mature actors with many more years of experience to draw on. As has been noted elsewhere, the graveside apparition of Marie Trintignant as Ponette's mother does seem a fanciful afterthought to give the story a kind of closure, but it is hard to see how the film could have been brought to a conclusion without a similar contrivance. Not a film for the overly sentimental, and I include myself. After watching the film, I bought the DVD, but I,m still waiting the right time to rewatch it.

The only problem is, that the script itself is a bit flat and my wife and I kept wondering "where is the father--why did he abandon this little girl?!" This and many other unanswered questions bothered me throughout the film. In addition, although the subject matter is novel (a very young child searching to understand her mother's death), it just stopped being interesting after a while. Then, when the movie did change tone at the very end, it became pretty weird, though not entirely unsatisfying. Overall, the acting is fine but it just didn't arouse my interest.

    Although I found this to be one of the most affecting films that I have seen, I was, nevertheless, astounded at the real depth of feeling shown by the young children in this film. Victoire Thivisol carries absolute sincerity in her portrayal of the recently bereaved young girl, with a realism beyond belief when one considers her tender age. The other children also played their parts with a conviction that would be considered commendable in mature actors with many more years of experience to draw on. As has been noted elsewhere, the graveside apparition of Marie Trintignant as Ponette's mother does seem a fanciful afterthought to give the story a kind of closure, but it is hard to see how the film could have been brought to a conclusion without a similar contrivance. Not a film for the overly sentimental, and I include myself. After watching the film, I bought the DVD, but I,m still waiting the right time to rewatch it.

    Amazing realistic account of a girl who loses her mother but knows that she lives forever. Everyone has their own experiences with God and their own doubts, and she is passed back and forth a little, between believers and non-believers, most of which stand against her at some point. But her faith stays true to herself... ...and she eventually gets to get on with her life. Really realistic portrayal of how God communicates with different people and how some believers in God don't accept that and yet some non-believers can. From my own real life experiences I can confirm this to be possibly a completely true story, even the ending. And how believing it can leave you at odds with what the world might believe. Tried not to spoil the film for you, so watch it and be happy!

    I can't believe this came out 13 years ago. I feel like I just read the raves about the central performance like... four years ago. I've been meaning to see it. The movie concerns itself with how a four year old deals with the death of her mother. As anyone can tell you, the main child performance is excellent and remarkable. As hard as it is for an adult to come to terms with death, it must be heartbreaking to watch your child attempt to deal with it. But the movie has some big problems. I was surprised that after the early scenes which have at most one or two other actors in them, that adults go missing for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, this leaves the movie to present a certain type of "all children" scene over and over. For about ninety-five percent of its running time, toddling children are shown playing and hopelessly trying to make sense of death. It stays in that place for just too long. 40 minutes of the kids trying to comprehend super-natural rules for the dead, feels like an hour and a half. The kids can offer no insight; just verisimilitude, a lonely conceit that requires some support. For most of its length, Ponette is crying or confused. It just doesn't develop. I wish I could have seen Ponette interact with adults around her, in even the most rudimentary plot. Who are these awful parents who leave a toddler to fend for herself in wrestling with death? Wherever the movie goes, there is no shaking its belief that the answer to its dramatic problem is more talking. Having chosen such a small scale to encounter this material, it's not a surprise when the movie has no ending. It culminates in a gratuitous, conventional and sentimental wish-fulfillment scene filmed literally; it is not a fantasy as some insist, because a child's mind cannot manufacture the details we witness of her mothers return. It's just cheap. Both Spirit of the Beehive and The 400 Blows go more interesting places with material concerning childhood.

    It's evident and it deserves to be mentioned. When Jacques Doillon films children (un Sac De Billes, 1975) or teenagers (la Dr&ocirc;lesse, 1979, Le Petit Criminel, 1990), it's what he does best and especially when he pores over the dark sides of childhood and adolescence like rejection, misunderstanding, lack of love or the death of dear close relatives. "Ponette" revolves around the latest of these things. This cute 4 year old little girl lost her mother (Marie Trintignant,a sinister omen for her tragic fate some years later) and is persuaded she will see her again. So, she embarks on a long waiting which makes her father (Xavier Beauvois) and the grown-ups incensed. Her aunt (Claire Nebout) tries to provide her solace with the help of religious creeds but does she really believe in them? At the start of a new school year, she is sent at boarding school with her cousins and in a small church, asks God to talk to her mother. Then, in a graveyard in front of her mother's grave, a miracle happens. The first thing that springs to mind after the viewing is that you would like to hail Doillon for the remarkable work he has provided with the children. He said that he listened many conversations between children for months before rewriting them in dialogs and that's the main reason why his film has a larger than life vibe. Sometimes, you even wonder if you don't watch a documentary. Working with children on a film set is very hard to do but it's evident here that Doillon did everything possible to prepare his very young actors mentally to his cinematographic demands. So, little Victoire Thivisol and her partners really live their texts and it's the world perceived with children's eyes that is one of the real motors of the film. In another extent, Doillon walks away with the honors of a tricky topic: how can the life of a beloved human being can be perceived by her children? The Scottish Peter Mullan will bring his own answer in his moody "Orphans" (1997) and here, Ponette thinks she will see her mother again because she is seduced by the religious tenets her aunt tells to her. And when her mother appears beside her in the graveyard, it's a real foray into the fantastic without the unpleasant impression of a break in tone because the little girl is the only one to experiment this. During their short moment together her mother tells her: "I won't be able to stay with you but before I definitely leave, promise me one thing: don't complain, savor life as much as you can". We aren't very far from one of the key lines in John Frankenheimer's "Birdman of Alcatraz" (1962): "the first duty of life is to live" and it's the message Doillon left in his work. Ponette is bound to have understood the lesson and to follow this piece of advice. Perhaps you will keep it in your heart too after the viewing. So, from a murky starting point, Doillon manages to create a piece of work with a startling realism and an uplifting message. If you're sensitive to these features, "Ponette" will leave you elated. Highly recommended and I would advise you to watch it several times because very young children are often difficult to decipher in their lines. So, be patient and you will be rewarded.

    This is one of my favorite films of all time. It deals in a beautiful and complete manner with the way children perceive and process grief. The child in the lead role, Victoria Thivisol is astonishing and the rest of the cast are intuitive, strong, and poignant. The director is adept at letting the children in the film express the nuances of childhood: tenderness, confusion, mean-spiritedness, trust, humor, and deep sadness. This is a difficult and beautiful film to watch but please trust me when I say that it is a complete circle...it doesn't strand the viewer in a world of grief. This film is a gorgeous, difficult, complex poem.

    I have wanted to see this movie for a very long time. At the time it was released, my own Mother had suddenly died and I knew that it would have been too intense for me to watch. Now, it is almost 11 years later and I have finally watched it and this is quite simply one of the most true to life portrayals of grief and the journey it becomes for really anyone. I was Ponettes age when my father died and I can completely relate to her reactions, her agony and the confusion she portrayed. I can remember asking constantly when Daddy was coming back and not really accepting the answers that people were telling me. I also recall praying and talking to my father when I was alone in my room, begging him to come back and see me when no one else was around. I even had a dream about my father that was amazingly close to Ponettes interaction with her mother. This rang so true for me that I couldn't believe the writer of this story connected things in such a realistic way. Victoire Thivisol is shockingly real in this role. I cannot believe she was only 4 years old when this was filmed! It's a fascinating study of a shields emotional response to such a tragic event and quite honestly, I am at a total loss of words as to how to describe the power of this movie. I can only tell you that if you are looking for something intense and engrossing, this would be your movie. I really appreciated the feeling it left me with at the end too.....that life is not always easy and predictable but that humans are remarkably resilient beings who can actually grow in wonderful ways from the events that challenge us the most.

    This is a beautiful film. Watching it now as an adult I understand that there may have been some question of abuse. How can a little child know the difference between what's real and what's not to such an extent? It is truly moving to watch her cry in the prayer scene. Whatever your thoughts about whether or not this child should have been directed to perform this role, you cannot deny that it is a profoundly affecting portrait of childhood grief. A lot of people have complained that the ending is not conclusive enough, but I for one thought it was perfect. In life, things aren't usually wrapped up in a neat little package. All the actors in this film - especially the children - do an amazing job. One of my favorite films for many years.

    This movie is fantastic. What you can get from watching this movie cannot be described, which is a sort of power you can feel, which is something pure that grown-ups have lost. It's been ten years since its release. But it's still powerful when I watch it today. My hear is grabbed by the little girl. She is confused by her mother's death; she doesn't accept the reality; she believes she would see the mom again. She lives in pain which others are not able to understand. No one understands her; no one can help her; her father even thinks she's crazy. But what she feels and expects is precious, which has been lost by adults. Victoire Thivisol's acting is incredible. I never thought a 4-year-old could perform at such a level. She's great.

    Ponette is the story of a young French girl (4 years old) who's mother suddenly dies. It's a tough situation to explain to someone this young what exactly that means, and even more so when it's someone so close to them. The father, unsure of how to explain to Ponette that her mom is in fact, not coming back, and unable to convince her that the visions she keeps having of her mother being around every now and then, he sends her away for a while to live with friends and to cope with her loss as best as the adults and young friends around her can help her do. Victoire Thivisol, as the young Ponette, does a great job. I hadn't thought about it before that, as another view points out, this was not the fake sorrow of an actress with glycerine tears and such, all of the performance was real. And, although the story is interesting in that you see how a young kid might actually react to the death of someone they know and love, and how others might help them to cope with that, I was annoyed that about three quarters of the movie was Ponette crying over one thing or another. I suppose this is quite unsympathetic on my part to think that, damn, this kid is crying again? In all, I say that this film is for an audience that particularly enjoys its emotional dramas. Ponette has a lot to offer there. For others, the story may become either repetitive or just altogether dull to sit through, as at least one viewer has already expressed.

    It is absolutely amazing to see the star of Ponette as she acts. This child appears to be about four years-old and gives an incredible performance. The only problem is, that the script itself is a bit flat and my wife and I kept wondering "where is the father--why did he abandon this little girl?!" This and many other unanswered questions bothered me throughout the film. In addition, although the subject matter is novel (a very young child searching to understand her mother's death), it just stopped being interesting after a while. Then, when the movie did change tone at the very end, it became pretty weird, though not entirely unsatisfying. Overall, the acting is fine but it just didn't arouse my interest.

    Although I found this to be one of the most affecting films that I have seen, I was, nevertheless, astounded at the real depth of feeling shown by the young children in this film. Victoire Thivisol carries absolute sincerity in her portrayal of the recently bereaved young girl, with a realism beyond belief when one considers her tender age. The other children also played their parts with a conviction that would be considered commendable in mature actors with many more years of experience to draw on. As has been noted elsewhere, the graveside apparition of Marie Trintignant as Ponette's mother does seem a fanciful afterthought to give the story a kind of closure, but it is hard to see how the film could have been brought to a conclusion without a similar contrivance. Not a film for the overly sentimental, and I include myself. After watching the film, I bought the DVD, but I,m still waiting the right time to rewatch it.

    Amazing realistic account of a girl who loses her mother but knows that she lives forever. Everyone has their own experiences with God and their own doubts, and she is passed back and forth a little, between believers and non-believers, most of which stand against her at some point. But her faith stays true to herself... ...and she eventually gets to get on with her life. Really realistic portrayal of how God communicates with different people and how some believers in God don't accept that and yet some non-believers can. From my own real life experiences I can confirm this to be possibly a completely true story, even the ending. And how believing it can leave you at odds with what the world might believe. Tried not to spoil the film for you, so watch it and be happy!

    I can't believe this came out 13 years ago. I feel like I just read the raves about the central performance like... four years ago. I've been meaning to see it. The movie concerns itself with how a four year old deals with the death of her mother. As anyone can tell you, the main child performance is excellent and remarkable. As hard as it is for an adult to come to terms with death, it must be heartbreaking to watch your child attempt to deal with it. But the movie has some big problems. I was surprised that after the early scenes which have at most one or two other actors in them, that adults go missing for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, this leaves the movie to present a certain type of "all children" scene over and over. For about ninety-five percent of its running time, toddling children are shown playing and hopelessly trying to make sense of death. It stays in that place for just too long. 40 minutes of the kids trying to comprehend super-natural rules for the dead, feels like an hour and a half. The kids can offer no insight; just verisimilitude, a lonely conceit that requires some support. For most of its length, Ponette is crying or confused. It just doesn't develop. I wish I could have seen Ponette interact with adults around her, in even the most rudimentary plot. Who are these awful parents who leave a toddler to fend for herself in wrestling with death? Wherever the movie goes, there is no shaking its belief that the answer to its dramatic problem is more talking. Having chosen such a small scale to encounter this material, it's not a surprise when the movie has no ending. It culminates in a gratuitous, conventional and sentimental wish-fulfillment scene filmed literally; it is not a fantasy as some insist, because a child's mind cannot manufacture the details we witness of her mothers return. It's just cheap. Both Spirit of the Beehive and The 400 Blows go more interesting places with material concerning childhood.

    It's evident and it deserves to be mentioned. When Jacques Doillon films children (un Sac De Billes, 1975) or teenagers (la Dr&ocirc;lesse, 1979, Le Petit Criminel, 1990), it's what he does best and especially when he pores over the dark sides of childhood and adolescence like rejection, misunderstanding, lack of love or the death of dear close relatives. "Ponette" revolves around the latest of these things. This cute 4 year old little girl lost her mother (Marie Trintignant,a sinister omen for her tragic fate some years later) and is persuaded she will see her again. So, she embarks on a long waiting which makes her father (Xavier Beauvois) and the grown-ups incensed. Her aunt (Claire Nebout) tries to provide her solace with the help of religious creeds but does she really believe in them? At the start of a new school year, she is sent at boarding school with her cousins and in a small church, asks God to talk to her mother. Then, in a graveyard in front of her mother's grave, a miracle happens. The first thing that springs to mind after the viewing is that you would like to hail Doillon for the remarkable work he has provided with the children. He said that he listened many conversations between children for months before rewriting them in dialogs and that's the main reason why his film has a larger than life vibe. Sometimes, you even wonder if you don't watch a documentary. Working with children on a film set is very hard to do but it's evident here that Doillon did everything possible to prepare his very young actors mentally to his cinematographic demands. So, little Victoire Thivisol and her partners really live their texts and it's the world perceived with children's eyes that is one of the real motors of the film. In another extent, Doillon walks away with the honors of a tricky topic: how can the life of a beloved human being can be perceived by her children? The Scottish Peter Mullan will bring his own answer in his moody "Orphans" (1997) and here, Ponette thinks she will see her mother again because she is seduced by the religious tenets her aunt tells to her. And when her mother appears beside her in the graveyard, it's a real foray into the fantastic without the unpleasant impression of a break in tone because the little girl is the only one to experiment this. During their short moment together her mother tells her: "I won't be able to stay with you but before I definitely leave, promise me one thing: don't complain, savor life as much as you can". We aren't very far from one of the key lines in John Frankenheimer's "Birdman of Alcatraz" (1962): "the first duty of life is to live" and it's the message Doillon left in his work. Ponette is bound to have understood the lesson and to follow this piece of advice. Perhaps you will keep it in your heart too after the viewing. So, from a murky starting point, Doillon manages to create a piece of work with a startling realism and an uplifting message. If you're sensitive to these features, "Ponette" will leave you elated. Highly recommended and I would advise you to watch it several times because very young children are often difficult to decipher in their lines. So, be patient and you will be rewarded.

    This is one of my favorite films of all time. It deals in a beautiful and complete manner with the way children perceive and process grief. The child in the lead role, Victoria Thivisol is astonishing and the rest of the cast are intuitive, strong, and poignant. The director is adept at letting the children in the film express the nuances of childhood: tenderness, confusion, mean-spiritedness, trust, humor, and deep sadness. This is a difficult and beautiful film to watch but please trust me when I say that it is a complete circle...it doesn't strand the viewer in a world of grief. This film is a gorgeous, difficult, complex poem.

    I have wanted to see this movie for a very long time. At the time it was released, my own Mother had suddenly died and I knew that it would have been too intense for me to watch. Now, it is almost 11 years later and I have finally watched it and this is quite simply one of the most true to life portrayals of grief and the journey it becomes for really anyone. I was Ponettes age when my father died and I can completely relate to her reactions, her agony and the confusion she portrayed. I can remember asking constantly when Daddy was coming back and not really accepting the answers that people were telling me. I also recall praying and talking to my father when I was alone in my room, begging him to come back and see me when no one else was around. I even had a dream about my father that was amazingly close to Ponettes interaction with her mother. This rang so true for me that I couldn't believe the writer of this story connected things in such a realistic way. Victoire Thivisol is shockingly real in this role. I cannot believe she was only 4 years old when this was filmed! It's a fascinating study of a shields emotional response to such a tragic event and quite honestly, I am at a total loss of words as to how to describe the power of this movie. I can only tell you that if you are looking for something intense and engrossing, this would be your movie. I really appreciated the feeling it left me with at the end too.....that life is not always easy and predictable but that humans are remarkably resilient beings who can actually grow in wonderful ways from the events that challenge us the most.

    This is a beautiful film. Watching it now as an adult I understand that there may have been some question of abuse. How can a little child know the difference between what's real and what's not to such an extent? It is truly moving to watch her cry in the prayer scene. Whatever your thoughts about whether or not this child should have been directed to perform this role, you cannot deny that it is a profoundly affecting portrait of childhood grief. A lot of people have complained that the ending is not conclusive enough, but I for one thought it was perfect. In life, things aren't usually wrapped up in a neat little package. All the actors in this film - especially the children - do an amazing job. One of my favorite films for many years.

    This movie is fantastic. What you can get from watching this movie cannot be described, which is a sort of power you can feel, which is something pure that grown-ups have lost. It's been ten years since its release. But it's still powerful when I watch it today. My hear is grabbed by the little girl. She is confused by her mother's death; she doesn't accept the reality; she believes she would see the mom again. She lives in pain which others are not able to understand. No one understands her; no one can help her; her father even thinks she's crazy. But what she feels and expects is precious, which has been lost by adults. Victoire Thivisol's acting is incredible. I never thought a 4-year-old could perform at such a level. She's great.

    Ponette is the story of a young French girl (4 years old) who's mother suddenly dies. It's a tough situation to explain to someone this young what exactly that means, and even more so when it's someone so close to them. The father, unsure of how to explain to Ponette that her mom is in fact, not coming back, and unable to convince her that the visions she keeps having of her mother being around every now and then, he sends her away for a while to live with friends and to cope with her loss as best as the adults and young friends around her can help her do. Victoire Thivisol, as the young Ponette, does a great job. I hadn't thought about it before that, as another view points out, this was not the fake sorrow of an actress with glycerine tears and such, all of the performance was real. And, although the story is interesting in that you see how a young kid might actually react to the death of someone they know and love, and how others might help them to cope with that, I was annoyed that about three quarters of the movie was Ponette crying over one thing or another. I suppose this is quite unsympathetic on my part to think that, damn, this kid is crying again? In all, I say that this film is for an audience that particularly enjoys its emotional dramas. Ponette has a lot to offer there. For others, the story may become either repetitive or just altogether dull to sit through, as at least one viewer has already expressed.

    It is absolutely amazing to see the star of Ponette as she acts. This child appears to be about four years-old and gives an incredible performance. The only problem is, that the script itself is a bit flat and my wife and I kept wondering "where is the father--why did he abandon this little girl?!" This and many other unanswered questions bothered me throughout the film. In addition, although the subject matter is novel (a very young child searching to understand her mother's death), it just stopped being interesting after a while. Then, when the movie did change tone at the very end, it became pretty weird, though not entirely unsatisfying. Overall, the acting is fine but it just didn't arouse my interest.
