    The zany rude humor that whipped up gales of laughter in the riotous "Naked Gun" trilogy wanes in the shallow but mildly funny "High School High," a spoof of recent high school sagas such as "Dangerous Minds" and "The Substitute." Scenarists David Zucker of "Airplane," Robert LoCash of "BASEketball," and Pat Proft of "Brain Donors" aren't as successful with this half-baked entry. The comedy in "High School High" seems virtually colorless. Although it boasts more jokes per screen minute than "Airplane" and "Top Secret" or the "Naked Gun" trilogy, this production manages at least to amuse, even though it cannot intoxicate. Weasel-faced comedian Jon Lovitz of "City Slickers 2") plays Richard Clark, a sympathetic but na&iuml;ve educator who quits teaching history at a 'rich kids' academy to work in a poverty stricken ghetto school. Clark gets more than he bargained for at the inner city Marion Barry High School. No sooner has he climbed out of his car than the same vehicle mysteriously vanishes. Initially, Clark is blind to the rampant crime, gang, and drug problems afflicting the school. He is horrified to see Principal Evelyn Doyle (Louise Fletcher of "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest") hitting students with a baseball bat. While Clark fumbles with his own foes, Griff McReynolds (Mekhi Phifer of "Clockers") is coming back to finish school after a year in juvenile detention. McReynolds wants to go straight, but a gang of drug runners refuses to let him off the hook. Before these bad boys can convert McReynolds to their cause, they have to discredit Clark. Word-plays and sight gags constitute the best of what little comedy punctuates "High School High." The funniest scenes include a send-up of the Russian roulette duel in "The Deer Hunter," an attempted rape in the school library, and Clark's rain-splattered expulsion. Actor-turned-director Hart Bochner concerns himself more with the plot turns than the humor. Bochner doesn't develop his mise-en-scene as imaginatively as Zucker did in his "Naked Gun" movies. Zucker exploited every inch of a scene, with gags on the periphery. When Bochner tries to imitate Zucker, he fails miserably at the task. Bochner shoots the background out of focus where the action occurs so audiences have a hard time spotting students failing down stairs because they wear their pants too low. Blaming Bochner entirely for these shortcomings in this marginal comedy would be to overlook the writers' slack contribution. Indeed, "High School High" features a couple of truly inventive gags, but the movie suffers because there is not enough funny stuff. The writers stretch jokes and ides far beyond their limits, and "High School High" looks like a labored sit-com. The cast performs with deadpan brilliance, but their characters are rarely inspired or loony. Zucker, LoCash, and Proft should be ashamed that it took three of them to pen what little drivel "High School High" has.

    Richard Clark (Jon Lovitz- of SNL fame) is a bumbling, caring and out of touch prep school teacher who feels like he should be doing more. He leaves his prestigious position as head of his department for Marion Barry High School, a fictional crime riddled inner city haven for the worst of the worst. Richard aims to help students get a better life out of their rough neighborhoods, but with hilarious results. Along the way Richard has help with class from secretar- err...I mean administrative assistant Victoria Chapel (Tia Carrera- Wayne's World, True Lies) and former thug turned good guy Griff (Mekhi Phiffer- 8 Mile) to help Marion Barry be the best or quite possibly the best...umm maybe.

    I think that if I approach a movie full of cynicism then I will probably enjoy it much more than if I do not. In the case of this movie, High School High, I expected it to be as stupid and as sucky as was Spy Hard, which is in a similar vein. I guess the difference here is that this movie is made by the same people who created Hot Shots and Flying High. Highschool High is a send up of movies about rough highschools where a dedicated teacher comes along and changes all of the students around. Such movies I have seen in vague memories, and one that comes to mind is The Principle. Basically the major character is the son of the principle of a prep-school, but the students hate him. He decides that he wants to go out on his own and takes a job at Berry High (the joke becomes apparent at the end of the movie) which is the roughest school in the States. I guess the theme of this movie is you can do anything if you put your mind to it, and just because society says that you are something, does not mean that you have to fall into that mould. The humour is simply taking the believability to the point of stupidity. I will not say absurdity, as that is a particular type of humour where one laughs at the pointlessness of life. It is a far more intelligent humour, and for an example of absurd humour, I would direct you to a French Movie called News from the Good Lord. In this movie, the humour is far less intelligent, and is aimed at the lowest common denominator. I am not saying that the humour is bad, just that it is not intelligent. This is an okay movie, and I would simply say that it is only worth watching to shut ones' mind off.

    John Lovitz is very likable and very funny in this spoof of an inner city high school. The story is familiar, new, naive, fish out of water teacher, is eventually accepted because of his commitment to his students. "High School High", like most spoofs is a hit or miss affair. Some of the gags fall flat, but the film totally redeems itself with several hilarious moments. Stereotypes are on parade, but that of course is the purpose of a spoof, and things move rather quickly, so even the misses are easily forgiven. John Lovitz carries the film, but the supporting cast is quite good also. Bottom line, this is better than 95% of the similar parodies "National Lampoon" spits out, and is recommended of it's type. - MERK

    It's the same old story about a teacher who moves to an inner-city school to teach unruly kids, who of course, aren't interested in learning or being friendly. But in a comedy? It doesn't exactly work. But, I did enjoy the movie. Jon Lovitz is a funny guy, but he is miscast as the teacher. But in spite of that, he makes the movie fun to watch. He would probably be unbelievable as the teacher if this were a drama. And I don't mean 'unbelievable' in a good way. The movie has it's predicable moments, of course. But there's one moment where I didn't expect to see the principal. See if you can (or can't) figure it out. **1/2 out of ****

    It wasn't until fairly recently when I first knew this 1996 comedy existed. It's a parody of movies about teachers who get jobs at corrupt schools and try to make a difference. I was only ten years old when this came out, and it's a PG-13 rated film. When I first came across a copy of it in the video store over a decade later, I saw that the lead role was played by Jon Lovitz, a comedian I was familiar with. The film was also written by David Zucker, Robert LoCash, and Pat Proft, and I had previously seen comedies which they were involved in. Before seeing "High School High", I knew it wasn't a very popular spoof movie, but there was still a chance I could find laughs in it, especially with Lovitz in the starring role, and I did. However, unsurprisingly, most of these laughs were small ones, and in the end, I was not left very pleased by the movie. Richard Clark is a teacher who leaves Wellington Academy with another teaching job waiting for him at Marion Barry High School. Unfortunately, he quickly learns that working here will not be a pleasant experience, as this is a very dangerous school full of crime, where the students in general are deeply troubled and constantly get poor marks, and it doesn't look like they have a bright future ahead of them. After arriving at the school on his first day, Clark soon meets the hotheaded principal, Evelyn Doyle, and his first conversation with her turns out to be an embarrassing one, but he then meets an administrative assistant named Victoria Chapell, and falls in love with her. Despite how much trouble Clark's class puts him through, he remains determined to somehow guide them in a different direction, and has his new girlfriend to help him, but obviously, he's going to face more than one problem along the way! Around the time I started watching this high school movie spoof, I certainly wasn't always keeping a straight face, but it didn't exactly look that promising. The first part that made me laugh fully might have been the protagonist, on his first day teaching at Marion Barry High, getting rivals to shake hands in the hall, and unfortunately, not too many gags made me laugh that hard after that. There are some fairly unimpressive sight gags and I didn't really like most of the characters. There certainly were a number of scenes that made me at least smile or laugh just a little, which may not have been the case without a talented comedian like Jon Lovitz in the starring role, and eventually found at least one touching moment. For this, I feel I COULD be giving "High School High" a 6/10 instead of a 5, but definitely no higher than that. I won't advise people to avoid this movie at all costs, but can understand why it doesn't even come close to having the same kind of reputation as "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun".

    Man, you people are harsh. I didn't think this movie was bad at all. Heck, the first time I saw I fell in love with its stupidity. Before I start the review I'll explain my rating. I would have given this movie nine stars but I had to do my part to bring up the rating by giving it ten stars. 5.6? 6.0 is better rating for this movie. At any rate... The plot is that Richard Clark(Jon Lovitz) leaves Wellington Academy to go teach at Marion Barry High School against his father's best wishes. Richard believes that he can make a difference there and on his way he falls for a gorgeous teacher called Victoria Chappell(Tia Carrere). High School High was a spoof on those troubled high school kids movies like Dangerous Minds, Lean On Me and Stand And Deliver. Unlike the crap that passes for parody(like anything by Seltzer and Friedberg) HSH hits all of its targets and actually has a story tied to the spoof. Compare that with spoofs that are just about picking on pop culture and meaningless gags. Jon Lovitz was hysterical and as a comedic actor, he never got enough credit. Tia Carrere was gorgeous as well as funny and Louise Fletcher was funny too as the irascible school principal. Mekhi Phifer as well as the supporting cast add to the laughs too. If you can appreciate parodies that aren't extremely gross you might like this one. I feel its one of the most underrated spoofs ever produced by the Zucker Brothers. Two thumbs up.

    Back when there were real comedies in Hollywood. It is lovely. The best about it is that it isn't a parody. It's a comedy concerning a teacher-with-underachiever-students, having little spoofs of some movies here and there. The formula is familiar since Blackboard Jungle (1955), and To Sir with Love (1967). Actually, this kind of movies don't stop. It never has a time of prosperity, maybe due to the fact that teaching is a continuing exam, since the circumstances are always changing, bringing new generations with new ways to deal with them. Ironically, the same year of (High School High) witnessed also (To Sir, with Love II) the TV sequel, and close movies like (The Substitute), and (Eddie). It doesn't pick clips from previous movies and toy with them as movies, from the same year, did such as (Spy Hard) and (Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood). It shows an easy yet well-made story. Some perfect slapstick, lines, puns, and simple parody comedy. And the result didn't contain things like being forced, bad taste, toilet humor, or all what I watch in the comedies of today! The cast did a fine job, especially the minor parts. It's only Louise Fletcher who didn't amuse me, giving a one-note sullen face all along. The thing about Jon Lovitz is that he's Jon Lovitz in every movie or TV show. That's not a bad thing at all, but maybe it affected his career in a bad way. Although I love the guy, I even watched the movie more than once to savor him better, but sometimes his confused moves do bug. The twist of the Principal being the bad guy, who forged her students' results, was wild. Yet I can accept it as a far try to present a satire agrees with this movie's farcical time and general innocence. So accordingly when a school reaches being that bad, and stays as that, then the Principal must be a real *criminal* ! It's one small movie (it's even less than 90 minutes). But there are plenty of good dialogs (I love "Where The Hell is Our Dinner ?!!" the most), and detailed scenes (look at how the school was shown at the start). I can't forget the final encounter of the "new" students with their Principal in which they got to beat her by their hard study and right answers; see, this movie is constructively motivational on a deep level yet in its own way ! Even at one point the movie delivers a sad scene in a very special way; and I mean the moment of Richard Clark leaving the school, feeling the failure, with a rain over his head only, namely departing "under a cloud" literally. I love the genius blues melody in the background, the serious  rarely seen  performance of Lovitz, and the smart lines during it. Some criticized it as a predictable, formulaic...Well, so most of the comedies, rather most of Hollywood movies. However the question would be did the amount of entertainment manage to rule or not? And this time it did. So it's predictable, formulaic, yet clever and seductive to watch. I miss this kind of comedies. Now I can't find anything but teens trash, stupid family movies, and disastrous parodies like (Disaster Movie) !

    High School High is a comedy that seems to pull in several directions. On one hand, it wants to be a traditional Zucker-Abrams-Zucker movie, with surreal, non-sensical gags coming at every moment. These movies, like Airplane and Scary Movie are more like cartoons, because they never for a moment resemble real life. You don't end up caring what happens to the characters. On the other hand, it wants to be serious at times, like many romantic comedies, where you get emotionally invested with the people and the story. These two styles don't cohere. I guess the problem is that the movie does too good of a job getting you to like the characters and wanting them to succeed. Jon Lovitz as a dedicated teacher who turns his community around was halfway believable. As I stated earlier, however, parts of the movie seem to clash with each other. They are just too different in tone. The formulaic ending doesn't help much either. I enjoyed High School High, and there are PLENTY of genuinely funny moments. I just think they needed to decide what kind of movie they were making and stick to it.

    High School High is a very decent spoof comedy written by comedic geniuses Pat Proft and David Zucker. You recognize all these ordinary high school dramas like Dangerous Minds, The Substitute, High School Confidential and many others. And off-course there's many very absurd scenes that is very common to screenplays by Zucker. Also you can enjoy performance of Jon Lovitz. His character Richard Clark isn't stupid and clumsy like we know all Leslie Nielsens characters but just naive. At the same time Lovitz doesn't leave a strike that he is taking it all too seriously. Louise Fletcher's and Tia Carrere's performances were in full seriousness at the same time. They both played like in usual roles in usual high school films. High School High is a bit underrated but might not be as brilliant than the other films by Zucker/Craft but still it has it's moments.

There certainly were a number of scenes that made me at least smile or laugh just a little, which may not have been the case without a talented comedian like Jon Lovitz in the starring role, and eventually found at least one touching moment. For this, I feel I COULD be giving "High School High" a 6/10 instead of a 5, but definitely no higher than that. I won't advise people to avoid this movie at all costs, but can understand why it doesn't even come close to having the same kind of reputation as "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun".

    Man, you people are harsh. I didn't think this movie was bad at all. Heck, the first time I saw I fell in love with its stupidity. Before I start the review I'll explain my rating. I would have given this movie nine stars but I had to do my part to bring up the rating by giving it ten stars. 5.6? 6.0 is better rating for this movie. At any rate... The plot is that Richard Clark(Jon Lovitz) leaves Wellington Academy to go teach at Marion Barry High School against his father's best wishes. Richard believes that he can make a difference there and on his way he falls for a gorgeous teacher called Victoria Chappell(Tia Carrere). High School High was a spoof on those troubled high school kids movies like Dangerous Minds, Lean On Me and Stand And Deliver. Unlike the crap that passes for parody(like anything by Seltzer and Friedberg) HSH hits all of its targets and actually has a story tied to the spoof. Compare that with spoofs that are just about picking on pop culture and meaningless gags. Jon Lovitz was hysterical and as a comedic actor, he never got enough credit. Tia Carrere was gorgeous as well as funny and Louise Fletcher was funny too as the irascible school principal. Mekhi Phifer as well as the supporting cast add to the laughs too. If you can appreciate parodies that aren't extremely gross you might like this one. I feel its one of the most underrated spoofs ever produced by the Zucker Brothers. Two thumbs up.

    Back when there were real comedies in Hollywood. It is lovely. The best about it is that it isn't a parody. It's a comedy concerning a teacher-with-underachiever-students, having little spoofs of some movies here and there. The formula is familiar since Blackboard Jungle (1955), and To Sir with Love (1967). Actually, this kind of movies don't stop. It never has a time of prosperity, maybe due to the fact that teaching is a continuing exam, since the circumstances are always changing, bringing new generations with new ways to deal with them. Ironically, the same year of (High School High) witnessed also (To Sir, with Love II) the TV sequel, and close movies like (The Substitute), and (Eddie). It doesn't pick clips from previous movies and toy with them as movies, from the same year, did such as (Spy Hard) and (Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood). It shows an easy yet well-made story. Some perfect slapstick, lines, puns, and simple parody comedy. And the result didn't contain things like being forced, bad taste, toilet humor, or all what I watch in the comedies of today! The cast did a fine job, especially the minor parts. It's only Louise Fletcher who didn't amuse me, giving a one-note sullen face all along. The thing about Jon Lovitz is that he's Jon Lovitz in every movie or TV show. That's not a bad thing at all, but maybe it affected his career in a bad way. Although I love the guy, I even watched the movie more than once to savor him better, but sometimes his confused moves do bug. The twist of the Principal being the bad guy, who forged her students' results, was wild. Yet I can accept it as a far try to present a satire agrees with this movie's farcical time and general innocence. So accordingly when a school reaches being that bad, and stays as that, then the Principal must be a real *criminal* ! It's one small movie (it's even less than 90 minutes). But there are plenty of good dialogs (I love "Where The Hell is Our Dinner ?!!" the most), and detailed scenes (look at how the school was shown at the start). I can't forget the final encounter of the "new" students with their Principal in which they got to beat her by their hard study and right answers; see, this movie is constructively motivational on a deep level yet in its own way ! Even at one point the movie delivers a sad scene in a very special way; and I mean the moment of Richard Clark leaving the school, feeling the failure, with a rain over his head only, namely departing "under a cloud" literally. I love the genius blues melody in the background, the serious  rarely seen  performance of Lovitz, and the smart lines during it. Some criticized it as a predictable, formulaic...Well, so most of the comedies, rather most of Hollywood movies. However the question would be did the amount of entertainment manage to rule or not? And this time it did. So it's predictable, formulaic, yet clever and seductive to watch. I miss this kind of comedies. Now I can't find anything but teens trash, stupid family movies, and disastrous parodies like (Disaster Movie) !

    High School High is a comedy that seems to pull in several directions. On one hand, it wants to be a traditional Zucker-Abrams-Zucker movie, with surreal, non-sensical gags coming at every moment. These movies, like Airplane and Scary Movie are more like cartoons, because they never for a moment resemble real life. You don't end up caring what happens to the characters. On the other hand, it wants to be serious at times, like many romantic comedies, where you get emotionally invested with the people and the story. These two styles don't cohere. I guess the problem is that the movie does too good of a job getting you to like the characters and wanting them to succeed. Jon Lovitz as a dedicated teacher who turns his community around was halfway believable. As I stated earlier, however, parts of the movie seem to clash with each other. They are just too different in tone. The formulaic ending doesn't help much either. I enjoyed High School High, and there are PLENTY of genuinely funny moments. I just think they needed to decide what kind of movie they were making and stick to it.

    High School High is a very decent spoof comedy written by comedic geniuses Pat Proft and David Zucker. You recognize all these ordinary high school dramas like Dangerous Minds, The Substitute, High School Confidential and many others. And off-course there's many very absurd scenes that is very common to screenplays by Zucker. Also you can enjoy performance of Jon Lovitz. His character Richard Clark isn't stupid and clumsy like we know all Leslie Nielsens characters but just naive. At the same time Lovitz doesn't leave a strike that he is taking it all too seriously. Louise Fletcher's and Tia Carrere's performances were in full seriousness at the same time. They both played like in usual roles in usual high school films. High School High is a bit underrated but might not be as brilliant than the other films by Zucker/Craft but still it has it's moments.

    The zany rude humor that whipped up gales of laughter in the riotous "Naked Gun" trilogy wanes in the shallow but mildly funny "High School High," a spoof of recent high school sagas such as "Dangerous Minds" and "The Substitute." Scenarists David Zucker of "Airplane," Robert LoCash of "BASEketball," and Pat Proft of "Brain Donors" aren't as successful with this half-baked entry. The comedy in "High School High" seems virtually colorless. Although it boasts more jokes per screen minute than "Airplane" and "Top Secret" or the "Naked Gun" trilogy, this production manages at least to amuse, even though it cannot intoxicate. Weasel-faced comedian Jon Lovitz of "City Slickers 2") plays Richard Clark, a sympathetic but na&iuml;ve educator who quits teaching history at a 'rich kids' academy to work in a poverty stricken ghetto school. Clark gets more than he bargained for at the inner city Marion Barry High School. No sooner has he climbed out of his car than the same vehicle mysteriously vanishes. Initially, Clark is blind to the rampant crime, gang, and drug problems afflicting the school. He is horrified to see Principal Evelyn Doyle (Louise Fletcher of "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest") hitting students with a baseball bat. While Clark fumbles with his own foes, Griff McReynolds (Mekhi Phifer of "Clockers") is coming back to finish school after a year in juvenile detention. McReynolds wants to go straight, but a gang of drug runners refuses to let him off the hook. Before these bad boys can convert McReynolds to their cause, they have to discredit Clark. Word-plays and sight gags constitute the best of what little comedy punctuates "High School High." The funniest scenes include a send-up of the Russian roulette duel in "The Deer Hunter," an attempted rape in the school library, and Clark's rain-splattered expulsion. Actor-turned-director Hart Bochner concerns himself more with the plot turns than the humor. Bochner doesn't develop his mise-en-scene as imaginatively as Zucker did in his "Naked Gun" movies. Zucker exploited every inch of a scene, with gags on the periphery. When Bochner tries to imitate Zucker, he fails miserably at the task. Bochner shoots the background out of focus where the action occurs so audiences have a hard time spotting students failing down stairs because they wear their pants too low. Blaming Bochner entirely for these shortcomings in this marginal comedy would be to overlook the writers' slack contribution. Indeed, "High School High" features a couple of truly inventive gags, but the movie suffers because there is not enough funny stuff. The writers stretch jokes and ides far beyond their limits, and "High School High" looks like a labored sit-com. The cast performs with deadpan brilliance, but their characters are rarely inspired or loony. Zucker, LoCash, and Proft should be ashamed that it took three of them to pen what little drivel "High School High" has.

    Richard Clark (Jon Lovitz- of SNL fame) is a bumbling, caring and out of touch prep school teacher who feels like he should be doing more. He leaves his prestigious position as head of his department for Marion Barry High School, a fictional crime riddled inner city haven for the worst of the worst. Richard aims to help students get a better life out of their rough neighborhoods, but with hilarious results. Along the way Richard has help with class from secretar- err...I mean administrative assistant Victoria Chapel (Tia Carrera- Wayne's World, True Lies) and former thug turned good guy Griff (Mekhi Phiffer- 8 Mile) to help Marion Barry be the best or quite possibly the best...umm maybe.

    I think that if I approach a movie full of cynicism then I will probably enjoy it much more than if I do not. In the case of this movie, High School High, I expected it to be as stupid and as sucky as was Spy Hard, which is in a similar vein. I guess the difference here is that this movie is made by the same people who created Hot Shots and Flying High. Highschool High is a send up of movies about rough highschools where a dedicated teacher comes along and changes all of the students around. Such movies I have seen in vague memories, and one that comes to mind is The Principle. Basically the major character is the son of the principle of a prep-school, but the students hate him. He decides that he wants to go out on his own and takes a job at Berry High (the joke becomes apparent at the end of the movie) which is the roughest school in the States. I guess the theme of this movie is you can do anything if you put your mind to it, and just because society says that you are something, does not mean that you have to fall into that mould. The humour is simply taking the believability to the point of stupidity. I will not say absurdity, as that is a particular type of humour where one laughs at the pointlessness of life. It is a far more intelligent humour, and for an example of absurd humour, I would direct you to a French Movie called News from the Good Lord. In this movie, the humour is far less intelligent, and is aimed at the lowest common denominator. I am not saying that the humour is bad, just that it is not intelligent. This is an okay movie, and I would simply say that it is only worth watching to shut ones' mind off.

    John Lovitz is very likable and very funny in this spoof of an inner city high school. The story is familiar, new, naive, fish out of water teacher, is eventually accepted because of his commitment to his students. "High School High", like most spoofs is a hit or miss affair. Some of the gags fall flat, but the film totally redeems itself with several hilarious moments. Stereotypes are on parade, but that of course is the purpose of a spoof, and things move rather quickly, so even the misses are easily forgiven. John Lovitz carries the film, but the supporting cast is quite good also. Bottom line, this is better than 95% of the similar parodies "National Lampoon" spits out, and is recommended of it's type. - MERK

    It's the same old story about a teacher who moves to an inner-city school to teach unruly kids, who of course, aren't interested in learning or being friendly. But in a comedy? It doesn't exactly work. But, I did enjoy the movie. Jon Lovitz is a funny guy, but he is miscast as the teacher. But in spite of that, he makes the movie fun to watch. He would probably be unbelievable as the teacher if this were a drama. And I don't mean 'unbelievable' in a good way. The movie has it's predicable moments, of course. But there's one moment where I didn't expect to see the principal. See if you can (or can't) figure it out. **1/2 out of ****

    It wasn't until fairly recently when I first knew this 1996 comedy existed. It's a parody of movies about teachers who get jobs at corrupt schools and try to make a difference. I was only ten years old when this came out, and it's a PG-13 rated film. When I first came across a copy of it in the video store over a decade later, I saw that the lead role was played by Jon Lovitz, a comedian I was familiar with. The film was also written by David Zucker, Robert LoCash, and Pat Proft, and I had previously seen comedies which they were involved in. Before seeing "High School High", I knew it wasn't a very popular spoof movie, but there was still a chance I could find laughs in it, especially with Lovitz in the starring role, and I did. However, unsurprisingly, most of these laughs were small ones, and in the end, I was not left very pleased by the movie. Richard Clark is a teacher who leaves Wellington Academy with another teaching job waiting for him at Marion Barry High School. Unfortunately, he quickly learns that working here will not be a pleasant experience, as this is a very dangerous school full of crime, where the students in general are deeply troubled and constantly get poor marks, and it doesn't look like they have a bright future ahead of them. After arriving at the school on his first day, Clark soon meets the hotheaded principal, Evelyn Doyle, and his first conversation with her turns out to be an embarrassing one, but he then meets an administrative assistant named Victoria Chapell, and falls in love with her. Despite how much trouble Clark's class puts him through, he remains determined to somehow guide them in a different direction, and has his new girlfriend to help him, but obviously, he's going to face more than one problem along the way! Around the time I started watching this high school movie spoof, I certainly wasn't always keeping a straight face, but it didn't exactly look that promising. The first part that made me laugh fully might have been the protagonist, on his first day teaching at Marion Barry High, getting rivals to shake hands in the hall, and unfortunately, not too many gags made me laugh that hard after that. There are some fairly unimpressive sight gags and I didn't really like most of the characters. There certainly were a number of scenes that made me at least smile or laugh just a little, which may not have been the case without a talented comedian like Jon Lovitz in the starring role, and eventually found at least one touching moment. For this, I feel I COULD be giving "High School High" a 6/10 instead of a 5, but definitely no higher than that. I won't advise people to avoid this movie at all costs, but can understand why it doesn't even come close to having the same kind of reputation as "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun".

    I think that if I approach a movie full of cynicism then I will probably enjoy it much more than if I do not. In the case of this movie, High School High, I expected it to be as stupid and as sucky as was Spy Hard, which is in a similar vein. I guess the difference here is that this movie is made by the same people who created Hot Shots and Flying High. Highschool High is a send up of movies about rough highschools where a dedicated teacher comes along and changes all of the students around. Such movies I have seen in vague memories, and one that comes to mind is The Principle. Basically the major character is the son of the principle of a prep-school, but the students hate him. He decides that he wants to go out on his own and takes a job at Berry High (the joke becomes apparent at the end of the movie) which is the roughest school in the States. I guess the theme of this movie is you can do anything if you put your mind to it, and just because society says that you are something, does not mean that you have to fall into that mould. The humour is simply taking the believability to the point of stupidity. I will not say absurdity, as that is a particular type of humour where one laughs at the pointlessness of life. It is a far more intelligent humour, and for an example of absurd humour, I would direct you to a French Movie called News from the Good Lord. In this movie, the humour is far less intelligent, and is aimed at the lowest common denominator. I am not saying that the humour is bad, just that it is not intelligent. This is an okay movie, and I would simply say that it is only worth watching to shut ones' mind off.

    John Lovitz is very likable and very funny in this spoof of an inner city high school. The story is familiar, new, naive, fish out of water teacher, is eventually accepted because of his commitment to his students. "High School High", like most spoofs is a hit or miss affair. Some of the gags fall flat, but the film totally redeems itself with several hilarious moments. Stereotypes are on parade, but that of course is the purpose of a spoof, and things move rather quickly, so even the misses are easily forgiven. John Lovitz carries the film, but the supporting cast is quite good also. Bottom line, this is better than 95% of the similar parodies "National Lampoon" spits out, and is recommended of it's type. - MERK

    It's the same old story about a teacher who moves to an inner-city school to teach unruly kids, who of course, aren't interested in learning or being friendly. But in a comedy? It doesn't exactly work. But, I did enjoy the movie. Jon Lovitz is a funny guy, but he is miscast as the teacher. But in spite of that, he makes the movie fun to watch. He would probably be unbelievable as the teacher if this were a drama. And I don't mean 'unbelievable' in a good way. The movie has it's predicable moments, of course. But there's one moment where I didn't expect to see the principal. See if you can (or can't) figure it out. **1/2 out of ****

    A spoof with a number of mildly amusing parts and a good comedian in the starring role, but it still isn't really that high

    It wasn't until fairly recently when I first knew this 1996 comedy existed. It's a parody of movies about teachers who get jobs at corrupt schools and try to make a difference. I was only ten years old when this came out, and it's a PG-13 rated film. When I first came across a copy of it in the video store over a decade later, I saw that the lead role was played by Jon Lovitz, a comedian I was familiar with. The film was also written by David Zucker, Robert LoCash, and Pat Proft, and I had previously seen comedies which they were involved in. Before seeing "High School High", I knew it wasn't a very popular spoof movie, but there was still a chance I could find laughs in it, especially with Lovitz in the starring role, and I did. However, unsurprisingly, most of these laughs were small ones, and in the end, I was not left very pleased by the movie. Richard Clark is a teacher who leaves Wellington Academy with another teaching job waiting for him at Marion Barry High School. Unfortunately, he quickly learns that working here will not be a pleasant experience, as this is a very dangerous school full of crime, where the students in general are deeply troubled and constantly get poor marks, and it doesn't look like they have a bright future ahead of them. After arriving at the school on his first day, Clark soon meets the hotheaded principal, Evelyn Doyle, and his first conversation with her turns out to be an embarrassing one, but he then meets an administrative assistant named Victoria Chapell, and falls in love with her. Despite how much trouble Clark's class puts him through, he remains determined to somehow guide them in a different direction, and has his new girlfriend to help him, but obviously, he's going to face more than one problem along the way! Around the time I started watching this high school movie spoof, I certainly wasn't always keeping a straight face, but it didn't exactly look that promising. The first part that made me laugh fully might have been the protagonist, on his first day teaching at Marion Barry High, getting rivals to shake hands in the hall, and unfortunately, not too many gags made me laugh that hard after that. There are some fairly unimpressive sight gags and I didn't really like most of the characters. There certainly were a number of scenes that made me at least smile or laugh just a little, which may not have been the case without a talented comedian like Jon Lovitz in the starring role, and eventually found at least one touching moment. For this, I feel I COULD be giving "High School High" a 6/10 instead of a 5, but definitely no higher than that. I won't advise people to avoid this movie at all costs, but can understand why it doesn't even come close to having the same kind of reputation as "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun".

    Man, you people are harsh. I didn't think this movie was bad at all. Heck, the first time I saw I fell in love with its stupidity. Before I start the review I'll explain my rating. I would have given this movie nine stars but I had to do my part to bring up the rating by giving it ten stars. 5.6? 6.0 is better rating for this movie. At any rate... The plot is that Richard Clark(Jon Lovitz) leaves Wellington Academy to go teach at Marion Barry High School against his father's best wishes. Richard believes that he can make a difference there and on his way he falls for a gorgeous teacher called Victoria Chappell(Tia Carrere). High School High was a spoof on those troubled high school kids movies like Dangerous Minds, Lean On Me and Stand And Deliver. Unlike the crap that passes for parody(like anything by Seltzer and Friedberg) HSH hits all of its targets and actually has a story tied to the spoof. Compare that with spoofs that are just about picking on pop culture and meaningless gags. Jon Lovitz was hysterical and as a comedic actor, he never got enough credit. Tia Carrere was gorgeous as well as funny and Louise Fletcher was funny too as the irascible school principal. Mekhi Phifer as well as the supporting cast add to the laughs too. If you can appreciate parodies that aren't extremely gross you might like this one. I feel its one of the most underrated spoofs ever produced by the Zucker Brothers. Two thumbs up.

    Back when there were real comedies in Hollywood. It is lovely. The best about it is that it isn't a parody. It's a comedy concerning a teacher-with-underachiever-students, having little spoofs of some movies here and there. The formula is familiar since Blackboard Jungle (1955), and To Sir with Love (1967). Actually, this kind of movies don't stop. It never has a time of prosperity, maybe due to the fact that teaching is a continuing exam, since the circumstances are always changing, bringing new generations with new ways to deal with them. Ironically, the same year of (High School High) witnessed also (To Sir, with Love II) the TV sequel, and close movies like (The Substitute), and (Eddie). It doesn't pick clips from previous movies and toy with them as movies, from the same year, did such as (Spy Hard) and (Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood). It shows an easy yet well-made story. Some perfect slapstick, lines, puns, and simple parody comedy. And the result didn't contain things like being forced, bad taste, toilet humor, or all what I watch in the comedies of today! The cast did a fine job, especially the minor parts. It's only Louise Fletcher who didn't amuse me, giving a one-note sullen face all along. The thing about Jon Lovitz is that he's Jon Lovitz in every movie or TV show. That's not a bad thing at all, but maybe it affected his career in a bad way. Although I love the guy, I even watched the movie more than once to savor him better, but sometimes his confused moves do bug. The twist of the Principal being the bad guy, who forged her students' results, was wild. Yet I can accept it as a far try to present a satire agrees with this movie's farcical time and general innocence. So accordingly when a school reaches being that bad, and stays as that, then the Principal must be a real *criminal* ! It's one small movie (it's even less than 90 minutes). But there are plenty of good dialogs (I love "Where The Hell is Our Dinner ?!!" the most), and detailed scenes (look at how the school was shown at the start). I can't forget the final encounter of the "new" students with their Principal in which they got to beat her by their hard study and right answers; see, this movie is constructively motivational on a deep level yet in its own way ! Even at one point the movie delivers a sad scene in a very special way; and I mean the moment of Richard Clark leaving the school, feeling the failure, with a rain over his head only, namely departing "under a cloud" literally. I love the genius blues melody in the background, the serious  rarely seen  performance of Lovitz, and the smart lines during it. Some criticized it as a predictable, formulaic...Well, so most of the comedies, rather most of Hollywood movies. However the question would be did the amount of entertainment manage to rule or not? And this time it did. So it's predictable, formulaic, yet clever and seductive to watch. I miss this kind of comedies. Now I can't find anything but teens trash, stupid family movies, and disastrous parodies like (Disaster Movie) !

    High School High is a comedy that seems to pull in several directions. On one hand, it wants to be a traditional Zucker-Abrams-Zucker movie, with surreal, non-sensical gags coming at every moment. These movies, like Airplane and Scary Movie are more like cartoons, because they never for a moment resemble real life. You don't end up caring what happens to the characters. On the other hand, it wants to be serious at times, like many romantic comedies, where you get emotionally invested with the people and the story. These two styles don't cohere. I guess the problem is that the movie does too good of a job getting you to like the characters and wanting them to succeed. Jon Lovitz as a dedicated teacher who turns his community around was halfway believable. As I stated earlier, however, parts of the movie seem to clash with each other. They are just too different in tone. The formulaic ending doesn't help much either. I enjoyed High School High, and there are PLENTY of genuinely funny moments. I just think they needed to decide what kind of movie they were making and stick to it.

    High School High is a very decent spoof comedy written by comedic geniuses Pat Proft and David Zucker. You recognize all these ordinary high school dramas like Dangerous Minds, The Substitute, High School Confidential and many others. And off-course there's many very absurd scenes that is very common to screenplays by Zucker. Also you can enjoy performance of Jon Lovitz. His character Richard Clark isn't stupid and clumsy like we know all Leslie Nielsens characters but just naive. At the same time Lovitz doesn't leave a strike that he is taking it all too seriously. Louise Fletcher's and Tia Carrere's performances were in full seriousness at the same time. They both played like in usual roles in usual high school films. High School High is a bit underrated but might not be as brilliant than the other films by Zucker/Craft but still it has it's moments.
