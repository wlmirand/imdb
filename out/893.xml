  The incredibly rich, but miserable New York couple, Brad and Caroline Sexton, got framed by their accountant, and fled from the IRS to the one place where noone would look for them: Amish country. Now they've got to do their best to blend in, and learn how to love all over again.

    Very enjoyable film indeed! Just imagine the shock of finding yourself, accustomed from birth as a limousine liberal, iPhone user, city dweller (Manhattan), huge luxury Penthouse, Armani wardrobe, all of a sudden thrown amid an Amish community, android users for sure (if not older generation devices as to make them Luddites from a bygone era) and put to pound over rural handwork from past times --as Amish do-- with such intensity as to make you forget your previous and recent big economic and legal problems. The situations are hilarious and Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley go through them with flying colors, both superb comedians. Their situation within that community lasts only a few weeks, and during that time they changed a lot from their previously artificial, secluded by money (plenty of it) Manhattan Walled Life of the Ultra Rich to become appreciative of humane qualities that they've forgotten living the "glamorous" type of life of the Limitless Credit Card world. Inconsequential movie, maybe, but very funny?: YES INDEED!!

    Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley star in this as Brad and Caroline Sexton, an unhappy but high-rolling couple who suddenly find themselves in trouble with the IRS and flee to an Amish community to hide out in by posing as their distant relatives and being accepted into the fold. If that sounds vaguely familiar, it's because it is. This is basically a comedy remake of 1985's "Witness," in which Harrison Ford hid out in an Amish community to escape the corrupt cops pursuing him. The comedy was mixed. There was what I would consider to be some pretty typical farm humour (things like Brad being dragged on the ground behind a plow horse) but there was nothing outrageously funny. The film did a good job of portraying the change that the Amish community begins to make in the Sextons' life as they begin to rediscover their love for each other and as they start to buy into the Amish version of morality - simplicity, hard work and honesty. The Amish community really didn't come across to me as especially authentic. Mind you, it also wasn't a parody. There was no disrespect for the Amish; it just seemed to lack a degree of authenticity, at least to me. Allen and Alley did a good job of portraying the Sextons' change of heart, but they had no real spark with each other in my opinion. The movie is nothing to write home about, and in a handful of places - especially some of the early scenes between Brad and Caroline - it's a bit crude. It's passable - but nothing more to be honest. (4/10)

    I grew up in Chilliwack (google it!) in the sixties. Lot's of Mennonites there, good people, though they didn't wear the black clothes. This movie reminds me of my hometown, striking me as quite accurate in its portrayal of Mennonites and small town life. Richer or Poorer, in which a pair of high flying New Yorkers flee to Amish country and hide from the IRS, is funny and serious at the same time, with a terrific message (it's kind of like "Field of Dreams" in that way). If you're Canadian, move to a Chilliwack; if you're American, move to a Lynden WA. And slow down, make some friends, and live. PS: the one point demerit is for one instance of the "F" word. Otherwise this movie is pretty "family-friendly."

    My 3 kids love it, 10,13 and 15. My wife and I like it. It's nice to just watch a plain fun movie. its a breath of fresh air. Some movie and shows setup the funny parts so much their not funny. I am telling on my self now but it is a movie about our families life. Sold everything in New York moved and bought a farm in Virginia. People are much nicer down here. It's a slower pace and people even open the doors for you. I even have started saying "Yawl". I know nothing about farming but the people in the community helped us with out charging a dime. But all good things must come to an end. So many people have moved down here from up North. Had a man come up to me last summer, said I had to cut my grass it was ruining his property value. He was head of home owners assoc. and he was going to write a citation. He lived at the closet house to house about a mile and half away. The grass he wanted me to cut was the front 100 acres, It was a hay field. I told him he was trespassing and to kindly leave property. Funny thing he had just moved down here not 6 months ago, from not even 2 miles from wear we lived in the city. point is, he needs to watch this movie

    Okay, so most of this movie is not plausible, such as a lot of what happens once Brad and Caroline manage to convince an Amish family that they are relatives, but we'll let that one go for now. This is Tim Allen, as Brad, and Kirstie Alley as Caroline, and they are not two of our better actors out there now. But what they do, for the most part, is entertaining, if not predictable. And that is what this movie is: entertaining and predictable. The plot centers around a couple, who we learn early on cannot stand each other, and the fact that their financial manager has been cheating them on their taxes. We'll let it also go that a smart business person would not check his or her own taxes before signing. Then we have an armed IRS agent, obviously a nut-case, who goes after Brad and Caroline with a passion, and the couple somehow manages to end up in the same cab in their escape from New York (sorry, could not resist). They end up in PA and convince an Amish family that they are relatives, and thus are allowed to stay. We find out later why this man allowed them to stay, which also is not plausible, but a gap had to be filled in, and I guess that this was the best the writers could come up with at the time. This is your typical fish-out-of-water story, and some of the jokes are funny as are Allen's facial expressions. He does do that well. His little speech to Big John is actually very funny, as are most of the scenes with this horse. Sanders as Samuel Yoder was okay, but he did not behave the way we all know the Amish do, and that did not sit too well with me. So, if you can set aside the fact that what happens really would never happen, and this includes running away from the IRS, then just sit back and enjoy the ride.

    I simply "happened upon" this flick one afternoon when I had a couple of hours free which I hadn't expected. I never was a fan of either of the leads' television respective series. Tim Allen's appeal was lost on me, and I frankly found Kirstie Alley downright annoying. So this movie was a total surprise for me. When I tuned-in, I expected I'd probably switch channel within two minutes, but got interested and enjoyed it throughout. Neither lead displayed the least bit of "ham," nor gnawed any scenery, as I would have expected. Their performances were both excellent, their chemistry on-screen complete, and the supporting cast were plausible where appropriate and provided some comic hi-jinks, likewise. One of those thoroughly warm and pleasant films, which flies under the proverbial "radar," and appears with little notoriety.. It's a fine presentation which I'd also view again when opportunity presents.

    This movie is great and I can't understand why it didn't do better at the box office. It's a fun film with lots of laughs - also heartwarming how this totally foreign and initially irritating environment at the Yoder farm leads the Sexton's from chaos in their lives to stability in their marriage. Yes, some of it is far-fetched and highly unrealistic, but folks, it's a FILM! Why must everything be reality these days?! Reality can really suck sometimes and an escape with a movie like this is just the ticket to two hours worth of wishing life could really be like this. I thought the actors portraying the Yoder family performed extremely well and were immediately likable. I am a Pennsylvanian and have been to the "Amish Country" countless times. I know this film was shot on location in Maryland, but it really does closely resemble the Amish Farmlands in Lancaster County, PA. Who cares what the critics thought in 1997. This film is a favorite!

    I think this is the best movies of the 90's. Great humor from Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley. Who knew? Also, the comedy great Tim Allen used his line from Toy Story "I come in peace." Has anyone noticed that yet? This is the best Tim Allen performance I've seen so far. Thanks and also I'd like to say that they should do a sequel of this movie somehow. I first watched this movie about 2 years ago and fell in love with it immediately. Kirstie Alley always does her best to keep herself looking so good in movies I think. I definitely would recommend this movie to my friends and to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. Keep up the good work Tim Allen.

    Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley made one of the most mismatched couples I have ever seen, but that was the beauty of this movie, and the key to why it was so funny. They played off of each other very well. I also liked the fact that it didn't bash religion the way a lot of movies do nowadays, and that it won out at the end of the day. My only complaint about this movie was the scene where they spent the night sleeping in a cow pasture. Kirstie Alley was either very distracted or had to have her nose cut off not to notice until early the next morning that she was sleeping in cow manure. Whoever wrote that script obviously didn't spend much time in the country. To him (or her), I say if you're standing or sleeping in the middle of cow manure, you would notice it right away. Kirstie Alley is a Kansas girl. I'm surprised she didn't take the writers to task over this. Otherwise, this was a pretty upbeat, pretty funny movie. (I guess Big John was saying in horsease "I don't think so, Tim."). Seven out of ten for this one.

    This movie strikes me as the reverse of Tim Allen's Home Improvement. There, Tim's the over the top ham and his sidekick Al is the tempering force trying to contain him. Here, the Amish do the job and they are the greater force that really tone him down while still giving him plenty of opportunities to be funny. The theme of materialism getting into the way of relationships is needed in 2006 even more than in 1997 when this movie was released. It would be well for everyone to re-watch it now to realize that materialism has gotten totally out of control in today's world. Another thing that makes this movie enjoyable is that it isn't frantic like most comedies are. Too many try to emulate the Marx Brothers. In the frantic lives we do lead today to sustain our materialism, it is nice to have something slower paced yet still not bore you to death.

This is basically a comedy remake of 1985's "Witness," in which Harrison Ford hid out in an Amish community to escape the corrupt cops pursuing him. The comedy was mixed. There was what I would consider to be some pretty typical farm humour (things like Brad being dragged on the ground behind a plow horse) but there was nothing outrageously funny. The film did a good job of portraying the change that the Amish community begins to make in the Sextons' life as they begin to rediscover their love for each other and as they start to buy into the Amish version of morality - simplicity, hard work and honesty. The Amish community really didn't come across to me as especially authentic. Mind you, it also wasn't a parody. There was no disrespect for the Amish; it just seemed to lack a degree of authenticity, at least to me. Allen and Alley did a good job of portraying the Sextons' change of heart, but they had no real spark with each other in my opinion. The movie is nothing to write home about, and in a handful of places - especially some of the early scenes between Brad and Caroline - it's a bit crude. It's passable - but nothing more to be honest. (4/10)

    I grew up in Chilliwack (google it!) in the sixties. Lot's of Mennonites there, good people, though they didn't wear the black clothes. This movie reminds me of my hometown, striking me as quite accurate in its portrayal of Mennonites and small town life. Richer or Poorer, in which a pair of high flying New Yorkers flee to Amish country and hide from the IRS, is funny and serious at the same time, with a terrific message (it's kind of like "Field of Dreams" in that way). If you're Canadian, move to a Chilliwack; if you're American, move to a Lynden WA. And slow down, make some friends, and live. PS: the one point demerit is for one instance of the "F" word. Otherwise this movie is pretty "family-friendly."

    My 3 kids love it, 10,13 and 15. My wife and I like it. It's nice to just watch a plain fun movie. its a breath of fresh air. Some movie and shows setup the funny parts so much their not funny. I am telling on my self now but it is a movie about our families life. Sold everything in New York moved and bought a farm in Virginia. People are much nicer down here. It's a slower pace and people even open the doors for you. I even have started saying "Yawl". I know nothing about farming but the people in the community helped us with out charging a dime. But all good things must come to an end. So many people have moved down here from up North. Had a man come up to me last summer, said I had to cut my grass it was ruining his property value. He was head of home owners assoc. and he was going to write a citation. He lived at the closet house to house about a mile and half away. The grass he wanted me to cut was the front 100 acres, It was a hay field. I told him he was trespassing and to kindly leave property. Funny thing he had just moved down here not 6 months ago, from not even 2 miles from wear we lived in the city. point is, he needs to watch this movie

    Okay, so most of this movie is not plausible, such as a lot of what happens once Brad and Caroline manage to convince an Amish family that they are relatives, but we'll let that one go for now. This is Tim Allen, as Brad, and Kirstie Alley as Caroline, and they are not two of our better actors out there now. But what they do, for the most part, is entertaining, if not predictable. And that is what this movie is: entertaining and predictable. The plot centers around a couple, who we learn early on cannot stand each other, and the fact that their financial manager has been cheating them on their taxes. We'll let it also go that a smart business person would not check his or her own taxes before signing. Then we have an armed IRS agent, obviously a nut-case, who goes after Brad and Caroline with a passion, and the couple somehow manages to end up in the same cab in their escape from New York (sorry, could not resist). They end up in PA and convince an Amish family that they are relatives, and thus are allowed to stay. We find out later why this man allowed them to stay, which also is not plausible, but a gap had to be filled in, and I guess that this was the best the writers could come up with at the time. This is your typical fish-out-of-water story, and some of the jokes are funny as are Allen's facial expressions. He does do that well. His little speech to Big John is actually very funny, as are most of the scenes with this horse. Sanders as Samuel Yoder was okay, but he did not behave the way we all know the Amish do, and that did not sit too well with me. So, if you can set aside the fact that what happens really would never happen, and this includes running away from the IRS, then just sit back and enjoy the ride.

    I simply "happened upon" this flick one afternoon when I had a couple of hours free which I hadn't expected. I never was a fan of either of the leads' television respective series. Tim Allen's appeal was lost on me, and I frankly found Kirstie Alley downright annoying. So this movie was a total surprise for me. When I tuned-in, I expected I'd probably switch channel within two minutes, but got interested and enjoyed it throughout. Neither lead displayed the least bit of "ham," nor gnawed any scenery, as I would have expected. Their performances were both excellent, their chemistry on-screen complete, and the supporting cast were plausible where appropriate and provided some comic hi-jinks, likewise. One of those thoroughly warm and pleasant films, which flies under the proverbial "radar," and appears with little notoriety.. It's a fine presentation which I'd also view again when opportunity presents.

    This movie is great and I can't understand why it didn't do better at the box office. It's a fun film with lots of laughs - also heartwarming how this totally foreign and initially irritating environment at the Yoder farm leads the Sexton's from chaos in their lives to stability in their marriage. Yes, some of it is far-fetched and highly unrealistic, but folks, it's a FILM! Why must everything be reality these days?! Reality can really suck sometimes and an escape with a movie like this is just the ticket to two hours worth of wishing life could really be like this. I thought the actors portraying the Yoder family performed extremely well and were immediately likable. I am a Pennsylvanian and have been to the "Amish Country" countless times. I know this film was shot on location in Maryland, but it really does closely resemble the Amish Farmlands in Lancaster County, PA. Who cares what the critics thought in 1997. This film is a favorite!

    I think this is the best movies of the 90's. Great humor from Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley. Who knew? Also, the comedy great Tim Allen used his line from Toy Story "I come in peace." Has anyone noticed that yet? This is the best Tim Allen performance I've seen so far. Thanks and also I'd like to say that they should do a sequel of this movie somehow. I first watched this movie about 2 years ago and fell in love with it immediately. Kirstie Alley always does her best to keep herself looking so good in movies I think. I definitely would recommend this movie to my friends and to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. Keep up the good work Tim Allen.

    Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley made one of the most mismatched couples I have ever seen, but that was the beauty of this movie, and the key to why it was so funny. They played off of each other very well. I also liked the fact that it didn't bash religion the way a lot of movies do nowadays, and that it won out at the end of the day. My only complaint about this movie was the scene where they spent the night sleeping in a cow pasture. Kirstie Alley was either very distracted or had to have her nose cut off not to notice until early the next morning that she was sleeping in cow manure. Whoever wrote that script obviously didn't spend much time in the country. To him (or her), I say if you're standing or sleeping in the middle of cow manure, you would notice it right away. Kirstie Alley is a Kansas girl. I'm surprised she didn't take the writers to task over this. Otherwise, this was a pretty upbeat, pretty funny movie. (I guess Big John was saying in horsease "I don't think so, Tim."). Seven out of ten for this one.

    This movie strikes me as the reverse of Tim Allen's Home Improvement. There, Tim's the over the top ham and his sidekick Al is the tempering force trying to contain him. Here, the Amish do the job and they are the greater force that really tone him down while still giving him plenty of opportunities to be funny. The theme of materialism getting into the way of relationships is needed in 2006 even more than in 1997 when this movie was released. It would be well for everyone to re-watch it now to realize that materialism has gotten totally out of control in today's world. Another thing that makes this movie enjoyable is that it isn't frantic like most comedies are. Too many try to emulate the Marx Brothers. In the frantic lives we do lead today to sustain our materialism, it is nice to have something slower paced yet still not bore you to death.

    Very enjoyable film indeed! Just imagine the shock of finding yourself, accustomed from birth as a limousine liberal, iPhone user, city dweller (Manhattan), huge luxury Penthouse, Armani wardrobe, all of a sudden thrown amid an Amish community, android users for sure (if not older generation devices as to make them Luddites from a bygone era) and put to pound over rural handwork from past times --as Amish do-- with such intensity as to make you forget your previous and recent big economic and legal problems. The situations are hilarious and Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley go through them with flying colors, both superb comedians. Their situation within that community lasts only a few weeks, and during that time they changed a lot from their previously artificial, secluded by money (plenty of it) Manhattan Walled Life of the Ultra Rich to become appreciative of humane qualities that they've forgotten living the "glamorous" type of life of the Limitless Credit Card world. Inconsequential movie, maybe, but very funny?: YES INDEED!!
