    Paul Newman & Robert Redford reunite for this Academy Award winning film directed by George Roy Hill about two con men who team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend by "stinging" a mob boss(played by Robert Shaw). Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period. Wouldn't go so far as giving it the best picture award, however, since it is just a good film, not in any way a great one, though it was a big hit at the time.

    I wish films today were made like the ones back in the 1970's because we would get high-quality films that decade got such as this film, The Sting. This film really surprised me because I was expecting a period-piece drama with some action but instead I got a film that is quite funny despite some dramatic moments. This film confused me at times and it will require a second viewing, but that doesn't stop me from really liking this film. George Roy Hill's film is about how two con men, one older and the other young, who team up to set up a big con against a mob boss who murdered a mutual friend of theirs. This film is well-acted. Robert Redford was a young stud back in the day and he shows some fierceness in this role. Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors ever and this film is an example why. However, I really like Charles Durning's performance as the detective. It was funny to see him act like he's boss. Overall, this is a very good con film and it's full of twists and surprises which will come at very unexpecting moments. Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

    Like Chariots of Fire, The Sting is an undeserving Best Picture winner that owes it's enormous success to its score. In this case, Scott Joplin adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. Inspired by the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)which also featured a popular, Oscar-winning theme, The Sting reunites the director and the 2 stars with diminishing results. Butch Cassidy was diverting, had some charm, and was nice to look at, but The Sting is cloying, claustrophobic, and its charm calculated, and at 129 minutes it seems interminable because nothing in this film about an elaborate con involving good-hearted crooks seems to matter. As for movies dealing with cons, I prefer A Big Hand for a Little Lady, Trick Baby, House of Games, Felini's Il Bidone ("The Swindlers") and even Harry in Your Pocket which was released in 1973 the same year The Sting was named Best Picture while Badlands, Sleeper, Payday, The Homecoming, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Paper Moon, The Last Detail and Serpico were not even nominated for Best Picture

    The Sting succeeds on two levels. It succeeds with it's plot and it succeeds with it's characters. This is a rare feat, since most movies fail on both. The mere suggestion that it's possible to win at gambling is horrendous to many people. But to win by cheating is even more of a crime. However, to those of us who have lost a small sum on a pony or a hand of cards, The Sting is a smug rebuke at the bookies. Paul Newman carries this movie. His pool shooting character Fast Eddie in The Color Of Money, and jail bird, egg-swallowing Luke have matured into an experienced, confident hustler. We don't think of Paul Newman as the king of crime, but he has more cinematic criminal form than Marlon Brando. Paul Newman is the acceptable version of the criminal world, a role taken over by Tom Hanks in Road To Perdition. The movie is about cause and effect. If you do A then B will happen. And it never fails. It's also about making words fail...I've explained that in my review of Titanic. Of course in the real world, something, many things would have gone wrong with the plan in The Sting. Somebody would have sneezed, resulting in a moustache falling off, revealing the entire scam. The whole idea works on the thinnest of error margins. It's quite frightening how the concept of The Sting solidified itself in the real world of finance with the scandals of Enron and the sale of sub-prime mortgage CDO's to unsuspecting investors. The Sting shows how easily people can be fooled by the promise of making a quick buck. A movie to watch once, probably twice, but three times is once too many.

    The Sting is an ideal example of a fun, forgettable comedy. It's reasonably entertaining, it's pretty clever, and it's well acted. It's no masterpiece, and the twists and characters may feel overused now, but The Sting is still a decent way to spend 2 hours. Master con man, Johnny Hooker seeks revenge and reward to scam Doyle Lonnegan, a gang leader who killed Hooker's long time crime partner. Hooker gets the help of Henry Gondorff and others to make this elaborate scheme work. The plot may be paper thin, but The Sting manages to stretch itself to a rather unreasonable 2 hours. Certainly a sub-plot or two could've been removed and shaved off at least half an hour. Despite the length, The Sting is (mostly) entertaining from beginning to end. Production values are high. Cinematography is good, costumes are good, etc. It's hard to pick out a flaw in a movie like this. It's far from perfect, but The Sting makes few stumbles (though the script certainly could've been better). Acting is top notch. Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff pulls off the character well, and Robert Redford completely fades into the role of Johnny Hooker. Robert Shaw portrays a very interesting villain as well. The score (adapted by Marvin Hamlisch) is upbeat and jazzy. Clearly influenced by "The Entertainer," Hamlisch's score is a high point in the film. Besides the fact that's it late and I'm ready to turn in, I find myself with absurdly little to say about The Sting. I was entertained for the better part of 2 hours, and I will be checking out the score. What caused The Sting to be received with such acclaim is beyond me, but there are worse ways to spend a couple hours.

    When Film Fanatics, Critics, and Movie lovers discuss the great Directors, the name George Roy Hill is hardly ever mentioned. Even though he did make two of the most successful and popular Movies ever, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and this overrated Blockbuster. This is not an oversight. It is an insight. While those two mega-hits are above average and entertaining, they hardly can be regarded as groundbreaking Art or Cinema Masterpieces. Artistic achievement and popularity, at times, can be completely out of sync. This is an attractively flat looking, vaguely interesting, audience friendly Movie with high production values and is delivered by Professional Craftsmen, but it is rather unremarkable and has an inoffensive charm that was an against the grain of late 60's and early 70's trend of gritty realism that must have been a breath of fresh air for audiences and Academy voters that were enamored by its sweetness. Nothing here is a turnoff but it is hardly much of a turn on. It remains what it was. Not much more than an entertaining fluff piece with handsome Movie Stars and a slightly engaging story. Kind of a throwback to an era when life was less complicated or it seemed that way at the Movies. It was the Silent Majority that made this a Hit. The Counter Culture was less impressed and in retrospect, they were right.

    I was very pleased with myself, having avoided absolutely everything about this Best Picture-winning classic. I have never seen a Paul Newman film before, and was disappointed by Redford as Gatsby. I didn't even know what this film was about. Absolutely nothing. And it made the film that much better. The Sting is about con men performing 'the long con' on a shady banker, as revenge for a former partner. With throwback title cards we are walked through the process, which comes down to an elaborate gambling hoax. It was a bit frustrating to not know what was going on though. Not even the surface-level plan. And for a modern audience, 'straight poker' is a bit alien. Nonetheless, comprehending the plot is the most thinking you'll have to do during The Sting. Don't expect a life-changing moral or social criticism: entertainment is the goal of this slick, 30's set robbery. Take it at face value, enjoy the genius writing and oh-so-cool leads, fall for every hook and have a few laughs: The Sting is lots of fun, 40 years on. 8.5/10

    Directed by George Roy Hill, "The Sting" is one of the best movies of the 70s and in my opinion cinema history. Justifiably it was winner of Best Picture. It features an outstanding cast, competent settings, costumes, and best of all an exciting storyline. You could point to several stand-out scenes, but my personal favorite was the train set-up with Newman and Shaw. I thought Newman completely nailed it in every respect. Watching cheater Lonigan (Robert Shaw) fume and get cheated at cards with flamboyant and snide Newman was acting at it's all around finest and most entertaining from all involved. This movie is a classic in all regards. It may be easy to guess what's going on but that doesn't really detract from it. Highly Recommended

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own. For one thing, con men here are hunks, come with perfect hair and look like they haven't gone hungry a single day in their lives. And when they groom they look better than a young Bill Clinton. Neither anybody seems to be wanting for a job or going destitute as you don't see scenes so common in movies like Grapes of Wrath, Sullivan's Travels, or even in Stooges shorts, of crowded soup kitchens, lines for the unemployed, etc. Everything and everybody looks slick, clean cut, here and you don't even see any hint of racial segregation or discrimination. Murphy's Law never seems to apply here either: everything goes well for the good guys, even the impossible--escaping hero can pry open a manhole's cover with bare hands and bad guy never bothers to check gambling den between visits, etc. Despite all that the plot is well structured, impeccable in his logic and internal consistencyas long as you don't look too closely--so you may sit and watch TS as you would do with an amusing chess or tennis match. The plot: small time con man Hooker(Redford) unknowingly hits big time hoodlum Lonnegan (Shaw) with a $11.000 loss, along his partner Luther (R.E. Jones), who gets killed as the result. Hooker must run for his life and he comes to seek shelter with retired con man and Luther's good friend Gondorff (Newman) to whom he'll entice to get revenge on Lonnegan by hitting him with a big sting. Most of TS is dedicated to show how such sting unfolds, along with some other subplots, mainly of a corrupt cop who's after Hooker and about some professional assassin hired to kill him too. The FBI also seems implicated, as Special agent Polk (Elcar) sets his sights on Gondorff. Now, all this together put has created confusion for some, so let's go over the essentials. The mechanics of the sting is quite simple: Gondorff's gambling parlor is fake; it only works when Lonnegan visits. When this last arrives at the restaurant, at the time agreed upon, J.J. (Walston) starts scanning the wire for horse races that have just ended, checking the odds of the winner and then he "broadcasts" the race. He must pick a winner with the lowest possible odds so the money to be paid to Lonnegan will be a minimum. When he finds the race, he gives it to Kid Twist (Gould), in the 2nd floor room, and Kid gives it to Lonnegan, who runs to make his bet. Initially they had planned to do it only once but Lonnegan still wants another try, now for $15.000. Even worse, he wants to meet Hooker's man in the wire office. In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those "gamblers" as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan. That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question: how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question: If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them. The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing. And there is of course the well known ragtime piece by Joplin as score. In all, pure, 100%, entertainment. 7/10.

    The Sting is a gem of a movie. Set in 1930's Chicago, this well-told yarn about confidence men at the historical height of the con game features Paul Newman and Robert Redford at the pinnacle of their on screen chemistry. Redford plays Johnny Hooker, the younger, wider-eyed half of the duo, while Newman is Henry Gondorff, the grizzled, worldly mentor. The first con we see Hooker pull off is with his long-time guide and friend, Luther Coleman (played nicely by Robert Earl Jones). The victim of their con turns out to be an employee of Irish mobster Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), who has Luther killed. By Luther's former recommendation, Hooker hooks up with Gondorff to learn the "big con" so that he can take his revenge on Lonnegan for Luther's murder. We are enticed into identifying with these gentler forms of organized criminals, who are pitted against a richer, more connected organized criminal of the vicious, violent kind: "a guy who'd kill a grifter over a chunk of money wouldn't support him for two days." The third segment of this three-part society contains the accomplished, legitimate members, to which the mobsters have closer ties, it would seem, than the less egregiously illegitimate grifters. When Hooker attempts to woo a local bartender, he uses their common outsider status as an inducement: "I'm just like you. It's two in the morning, and I don't know nobody." At first, much of the enjoyment of The Sting comes from being included in the setup of Lonnegan, so dryly played by Shaw that we can't help but root for the colorful cast of con artists to take him down. Eventually, the filmmakers start withholding information about just how the final con is supposed to go down, and it becomes apparent that we have only partly been let in on the full expanse of the big sting. In a sense, we are as much of a mark as Doyle Lonnegan. The film earns our confidence just as Hooker and Gondorff earn Lonnegan's, and the trick is on both of us. When the big event finally comes off, we are as surprised as we are relieved, and the combined effect is extremely satisfying.

Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

Not even the surface-level plan. And for a modern audience, 'straight poker' is a bit alien. Nonetheless, comprehending the plot is the most thinking you'll have to do during The Sting. Don't expect a life-changing moral or social criticism: entertainment is the goal of this slick, 30's set robbery. Take it at face value, enjoy the genius writing and oh-so-cool leads, fall for every hook and have a few laughs: The Sting is lots of fun, 40 years on. 8.5/10

    Directed by George Roy Hill, "The Sting" is one of the best movies of the 70s and in my opinion cinema history. Justifiably it was winner of Best Picture. It features an outstanding cast, competent settings, costumes, and best of all an exciting storyline. You could point to several stand-out scenes, but my personal favorite was the train set-up with Newman and Shaw. I thought Newman completely nailed it in every respect. Watching cheater Lonigan (Robert Shaw) fume and get cheated at cards with flamboyant and snide Newman was acting at it's all around finest and most entertaining from all involved. This movie is a classic in all regards. It may be easy to guess what's going on but that doesn't really detract from it. Highly Recommended

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own. For one thing, con men here are hunks, come with perfect hair and look like they haven't gone hungry a single day in their lives. And when they groom they look better than a young Bill Clinton. Neither anybody seems to be wanting for a job or going destitute as you don't see scenes so common in movies like Grapes of Wrath, Sullivan's Travels, or even in Stooges shorts, of crowded soup kitchens, lines for the unemployed, etc. Everything and everybody looks slick, clean cut, here and you don't even see any hint of racial segregation or discrimination. Murphy's Law never seems to apply here either: everything goes well for the good guys, even the impossible--escaping hero can pry open a manhole's cover with bare hands and bad guy never bothers to check gambling den between visits, etc. Despite all that the plot is well structured, impeccable in his logic and internal consistencyas long as you don't look too closely--so you may sit and watch TS as you would do with an amusing chess or tennis match. The plot: small time con man Hooker(Redford) unknowingly hits big time hoodlum Lonnegan (Shaw) with a $11.000 loss, along his partner Luther (R.E. Jones), who gets killed as the result. Hooker must run for his life and he comes to seek shelter with retired con man and Luther's good friend Gondorff (Newman) to whom he'll entice to get revenge on Lonnegan by hitting him with a big sting. Most of TS is dedicated to show how such sting unfolds, along with some other subplots, mainly of a corrupt cop who's after Hooker and about some professional assassin hired to kill him too. The FBI also seems implicated, as Special agent Polk (Elcar) sets his sights on Gondorff. Now, all this together put has created confusion for some, so let's go over the essentials. The mechanics of the sting is quite simple: Gondorff's gambling parlor is fake; it only works when Lonnegan visits. When this last arrives at the restaurant, at the time agreed upon, J.J. (Walston) starts scanning the wire for horse races that have just ended, checking the odds of the winner and then he "broadcasts" the race. He must pick a winner with the lowest possible odds so the money to be paid to Lonnegan will be a minimum. When he finds the race, he gives it to Kid Twist (Gould), in the 2nd floor room, and Kid gives it to Lonnegan, who runs to make his bet. Initially they had planned to do it only once but Lonnegan still wants another try, now for $15.000. Even worse, he wants to meet Hooker's man in the wire office. In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those "gamblers" as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan. That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question: how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question: If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them. The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing. And there is of course the well known ragtime piece by Joplin as score. In all, pure, 100%, entertainment. 7/10.

    The Sting is a gem of a movie. Set in 1930's Chicago, this well-told yarn about confidence men at the historical height of the con game features Paul Newman and Robert Redford at the pinnacle of their on screen chemistry. Redford plays Johnny Hooker, the younger, wider-eyed half of the duo, while Newman is Henry Gondorff, the grizzled, worldly mentor. The first con we see Hooker pull off is with his long-time guide and friend, Luther Coleman (played nicely by Robert Earl Jones). The victim of their con turns out to be an employee of Irish mobster Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), who has Luther killed. By Luther's former recommendation, Hooker hooks up with Gondorff to learn the "big con" so that he can take his revenge on Lonnegan for Luther's murder. We are enticed into identifying with these gentler forms of organized criminals, who are pitted against a richer, more connected organized criminal of the vicious, violent kind: "a guy who'd kill a grifter over a chunk of money wouldn't support him for two days." The third segment of this three-part society contains the accomplished, legitimate members, to which the mobsters have closer ties, it would seem, than the less egregiously illegitimate grifters. When Hooker attempts to woo a local bartender, he uses their common outsider status as an inducement: "I'm just like you. It's two in the morning, and I don't know nobody." At first, much of the enjoyment of The Sting comes from being included in the setup of Lonnegan, so dryly played by Shaw that we can't help but root for the colorful cast of con artists to take him down. Eventually, the filmmakers start withholding information about just how the final con is supposed to go down, and it becomes apparent that we have only partly been let in on the full expanse of the big sting. In a sense, we are as much of a mark as Doyle Lonnegan. The film earns our confidence just as Hooker and Gondorff earn Lonnegan's, and the trick is on both of us. When the big event finally comes off, we are as surprised as we are relieved, and the combined effect is extremely satisfying.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford reunite for this Academy Award winning film directed by George Roy Hill about two con men who team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend by "stinging" a mob boss(played by Robert Shaw). Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period. Wouldn't go so far as giving it the best picture award, however, since it is just a good film, not in any way a great one, though it was a big hit at the time.

    I wish films today were made like the ones back in the 1970's because we would get high-quality films that decade got such as this film, The Sting. This film really surprised me because I was expecting a period-piece drama with some action but instead I got a film that is quite funny despite some dramatic moments. This film confused me at times and it will require a second viewing, but that doesn't stop me from really liking this film. George Roy Hill's film is about how two con men, one older and the other young, who team up to set up a big con against a mob boss who murdered a mutual friend of theirs. This film is well-acted. Robert Redford was a young stud back in the day and he shows some fierceness in this role. Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors ever and this film is an example why. However, I really like Charles Durning's performance as the detective. It was funny to see him act like he's boss. Overall, this is a very good con film and it's full of twists and surprises which will come at very unexpecting moments. Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

    Like Chariots of Fire, The Sting is an undeserving Best Picture winner that owes it's enormous success to its score. In this case, Scott Joplin adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. Inspired by the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)which also featured a popular, Oscar-winning theme, The Sting reunites the director and the 2 stars with diminishing results. Butch Cassidy was diverting, had some charm, and was nice to look at, but The Sting is cloying, claustrophobic, and its charm calculated, and at 129 minutes it seems interminable because nothing in this film about an elaborate con involving good-hearted crooks seems to matter. As for movies dealing with cons, I prefer A Big Hand for a Little Lady, Trick Baby, House of Games, Felini's Il Bidone ("The Swindlers") and even Harry in Your Pocket which was released in 1973 the same year The Sting was named Best Picture while Badlands, Sleeper, Payday, The Homecoming, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Paper Moon, The Last Detail and Serpico were not even nominated for Best Picture

    The Sting succeeds on two levels. It succeeds with it's plot and it succeeds with it's characters. This is a rare feat, since most movies fail on both. The mere suggestion that it's possible to win at gambling is horrendous to many people. But to win by cheating is even more of a crime. However, to those of us who have lost a small sum on a pony or a hand of cards, The Sting is a smug rebuke at the bookies. Paul Newman carries this movie. His pool shooting character Fast Eddie in The Color Of Money, and jail bird, egg-swallowing Luke have matured into an experienced, confident hustler. We don't think of Paul Newman as the king of crime, but he has more cinematic criminal form than Marlon Brando. Paul Newman is the acceptable version of the criminal world, a role taken over by Tom Hanks in Road To Perdition. The movie is about cause and effect. If you do A then B will happen. And it never fails. It's also about making words fail...I've explained that in my review of Titanic. Of course in the real world, something, many things would have gone wrong with the plan in The Sting. Somebody would have sneezed, resulting in a moustache falling off, revealing the entire scam. The whole idea works on the thinnest of error margins. It's quite frightening how the concept of The Sting solidified itself in the real world of finance with the scandals of Enron and the sale of sub-prime mortgage CDO's to unsuspecting investors. The Sting shows how easily people can be fooled by the promise of making a quick buck. A movie to watch once, probably twice, but three times is once too many.

    The Sting is an ideal example of a fun, forgettable comedy. It's reasonably entertaining, it's pretty clever, and it's well acted. It's no masterpiece, and the twists and characters may feel overused now, but The Sting is still a decent way to spend 2 hours. Master con man, Johnny Hooker seeks revenge and reward to scam Doyle Lonnegan, a gang leader who killed Hooker's long time crime partner. Hooker gets the help of Henry Gondorff and others to make this elaborate scheme work. The plot may be paper thin, but The Sting manages to stretch itself to a rather unreasonable 2 hours. Certainly a sub-plot or two could've been removed and shaved off at least half an hour. Despite the length, The Sting is (mostly) entertaining from beginning to end. Production values are high. Cinematography is good, costumes are good, etc. It's hard to pick out a flaw in a movie like this. It's far from perfect, but The Sting makes few stumbles (though the script certainly could've been better). Acting is top notch. Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff pulls off the character well, and Robert Redford completely fades into the role of Johnny Hooker. Robert Shaw portrays a very interesting villain as well. The score (adapted by Marvin Hamlisch) is upbeat and jazzy. Clearly influenced by "The Entertainer," Hamlisch's score is a high point in the film. Besides the fact that's it late and I'm ready to turn in, I find myself with absurdly little to say about The Sting. I was entertained for the better part of 2 hours, and I will be checking out the score. What caused The Sting to be received with such acclaim is beyond me, but there are worse ways to spend a couple hours.

    When Film Fanatics, Critics, and Movie lovers discuss the great Directors, the name George Roy Hill is hardly ever mentioned. Even though he did make two of the most successful and popular Movies ever, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and this overrated Blockbuster. This is not an oversight. It is an insight. While those two mega-hits are above average and entertaining, they hardly can be regarded as groundbreaking Art or Cinema Masterpieces. Artistic achievement and popularity, at times, can be completely out of sync. This is an attractively flat looking, vaguely interesting, audience friendly Movie with high production values and is delivered by Professional Craftsmen, but it is rather unremarkable and has an inoffensive charm that was an against the grain of late 60's and early 70's trend of gritty realism that must have been a breath of fresh air for audiences and Academy voters that were enamored by its sweetness. Nothing here is a turnoff but it is hardly much of a turn on. It remains what it was. Not much more than an entertaining fluff piece with handsome Movie Stars and a slightly engaging story. Kind of a throwback to an era when life was less complicated or it seemed that way at the Movies. It was the Silent Majority that made this a Hit. The Counter Culture was less impressed and in retrospect, they were right.

    I was very pleased with myself, having avoided absolutely everything about this Best Picture-winning classic. I have never seen a Paul Newman film before, and was disappointed by Redford as Gatsby. I didn't even know what this film was about. Absolutely nothing. And it made the film that much better. The Sting is about con men performing 'the long con' on a shady banker, as revenge for a former partner. With throwback title cards we are walked through the process, which comes down to an elaborate gambling hoax. It was a bit frustrating to not know what was going on though.

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own.

Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

    Like Chariots of Fire, The Sting is an undeserving Best Picture winner that owes it's enormous success to its score. In this case, Scott Joplin adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. Inspired by the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)which also featured a popular, Oscar-winning theme, The Sting reunites the director and the 2 stars with diminishing results. Butch Cassidy was diverting, had some charm, and was nice to look at, but The Sting is cloying, claustrophobic, and its charm calculated, and at 129 minutes it seems interminable because nothing in this film about an elaborate con involving good-hearted crooks seems to matter. As for movies dealing with cons, I prefer A Big Hand for a Little Lady, Trick Baby, House of Games, Felini's Il Bidone ("The Swindlers") and even Harry in Your Pocket which was released in 1973 the same year The Sting was named Best Picture while Badlands, Sleeper, Payday, The Homecoming, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Paper Moon, The Last Detail and Serpico were not even nominated for Best Picture

    The Sting succeeds on two levels. It succeeds with it's plot and it succeeds with it's characters. This is a rare feat, since most movies fail on both. The mere suggestion that it's possible to win at gambling is horrendous to many people. But to win by cheating is even more of a crime. However, to those of us who have lost a small sum on a pony or a hand of cards, The Sting is a smug rebuke at the bookies. Paul Newman carries this movie. His pool shooting character Fast Eddie in The Color Of Money, and jail bird, egg-swallowing Luke have matured into an experienced, confident hustler. We don't think of Paul Newman as the king of crime, but he has more cinematic criminal form than Marlon Brando. Paul Newman is the acceptable version of the criminal world, a role taken over by Tom Hanks in Road To Perdition. The movie is about cause and effect. If you do A then B will happen. And it never fails. It's also about making words fail...I've explained that in my review of Titanic. Of course in the real world, something, many things would have gone wrong with the plan in The Sting. Somebody would have sneezed, resulting in a moustache falling off, revealing the entire scam. The whole idea works on the thinnest of error margins. It's quite frightening how the concept of The Sting solidified itself in the real world of finance with the scandals of Enron and the sale of sub-prime mortgage CDO's to unsuspecting investors. The Sting shows how easily people can be fooled by the promise of making a quick buck. A movie to watch once, probably twice, but three times is once too many.

    The Sting is an ideal example of a fun, forgettable comedy. It's reasonably entertaining, it's pretty clever, and it's well acted. It's no masterpiece, and the twists and characters may feel overused now, but The Sting is still a decent way to spend 2 hours. Master con man, Johnny Hooker seeks revenge and reward to scam Doyle Lonnegan, a gang leader who killed Hooker's long time crime partner. Hooker gets the help of Henry Gondorff and others to make this elaborate scheme work. The plot may be paper thin, but The Sting manages to stretch itself to a rather unreasonable 2 hours. Certainly a sub-plot or two could've been removed and shaved off at least half an hour. Despite the length, The Sting is (mostly) entertaining from beginning to end. Production values are high. Cinematography is good, costumes are good, etc. It's hard to pick out a flaw in a movie like this. It's far from perfect, but The Sting makes few stumbles (though the script certainly could've been better). Acting is top notch. Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff pulls off the character well, and Robert Redford completely fades into the role of Johnny Hooker. Robert Shaw portrays a very interesting villain as well. The score (adapted by Marvin Hamlisch) is upbeat and jazzy. Clearly influenced by "The Entertainer," Hamlisch's score is a high point in the film. Besides the fact that's it late and I'm ready to turn in, I find myself with absurdly little to say about The Sting. I was entertained for the better part of 2 hours, and I will be checking out the score. What caused The Sting to be received with such acclaim is beyond me, but there are worse ways to spend a couple hours.

    When Film Fanatics, Critics, and Movie lovers discuss the great Directors, the name George Roy Hill is hardly ever mentioned. Even though he did make two of the most successful and popular Movies ever, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and this overrated Blockbuster. This is not an oversight. It is an insight. While those two mega-hits are above average and entertaining, they hardly can be regarded as groundbreaking Art or Cinema Masterpieces. Artistic achievement and popularity, at times, can be completely out of sync. This is an attractively flat looking, vaguely interesting, audience friendly Movie with high production values and is delivered by Professional Craftsmen, but it is rather unremarkable and has an inoffensive charm that was an against the grain of late 60's and early 70's trend of gritty realism that must have been a breath of fresh air for audiences and Academy voters that were enamored by its sweetness. Nothing here is a turnoff but it is hardly much of a turn on. It remains what it was. Not much more than an entertaining fluff piece with handsome Movie Stars and a slightly engaging story. Kind of a throwback to an era when life was less complicated or it seemed that way at the Movies. It was the Silent Majority that made this a Hit. The Counter Culture was less impressed and in retrospect, they were right.

    I was very pleased with myself, having avoided absolutely everything about this Best Picture-winning classic. I have never seen a Paul Newman film before, and was disappointed by Redford as Gatsby. I didn't even know what this film was about. Absolutely nothing. And it made the film that much better. The Sting is about con men performing 'the long con' on a shady banker, as revenge for a former partner. With throwback title cards we are walked through the process, which comes down to an elaborate gambling hoax. It was a bit frustrating to not know what was going on though. Not even the surface-level plan. And for a modern audience, 'straight poker' is a bit alien. Nonetheless, comprehending the plot is the most thinking you'll have to do during The Sting. Don't expect a life-changing moral or social criticism: entertainment is the goal of this slick, 30's set robbery. Take it at face value, enjoy the genius writing and oh-so-cool leads, fall for every hook and have a few laughs: The Sting is lots of fun, 40 years on. 8.5/10

    Directed by George Roy Hill, "The Sting" is one of the best movies of the 70s and in my opinion cinema history. Justifiably it was winner of Best Picture. It features an outstanding cast, competent settings, costumes, and best of all an exciting storyline. You could point to several stand-out scenes, but my personal favorite was the train set-up with Newman and Shaw. I thought Newman completely nailed it in every respect. Watching cheater Lonigan (Robert Shaw) fume and get cheated at cards with flamboyant and snide Newman was acting at it's all around finest and most entertaining from all involved. This movie is a classic in all regards. It may be easy to guess what's going on but that doesn't really detract from it. Highly Recommended

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own. For one thing, con men here are hunks, come with perfect hair and look like they haven't gone hungry a single day in their lives. And when they groom they look better than a young Bill Clinton. Neither anybody seems to be wanting for a job or going destitute as you don't see scenes so common in movies like Grapes of Wrath, Sullivan's Travels, or even in Stooges shorts, of crowded soup kitchens, lines for the unemployed, etc. Everything and everybody looks slick, clean cut, here and you don't even see any hint of racial segregation or discrimination. Murphy's Law never seems to apply here either: everything goes well for the good guys, even the impossible--escaping hero can pry open a manhole's cover with bare hands and bad guy never bothers to check gambling den between visits, etc. Despite all that the plot is well structured, impeccable in his logic and internal consistencyas long as you don't look too closely--so you may sit and watch TS as you would do with an amusing chess or tennis match. The plot: small time con man Hooker(Redford) unknowingly hits big time hoodlum Lonnegan (Shaw) with a $11.000 loss, along his partner Luther (R.E. Jones), who gets killed as the result. Hooker must run for his life and he comes to seek shelter with retired con man and Luther's good friend Gondorff (Newman) to whom he'll entice to get revenge on Lonnegan by hitting him with a big sting. Most of TS is dedicated to show how such sting unfolds, along with some other subplots, mainly of a corrupt cop who's after Hooker and about some professional assassin hired to kill him too. The FBI also seems implicated, as Special agent Polk (Elcar) sets his sights on Gondorff. Now, all this together put has created confusion for some, so let's go over the essentials. The mechanics of the sting is quite simple: Gondorff's gambling parlor is fake; it only works when Lonnegan visits. When this last arrives at the restaurant, at the time agreed upon, J.J. (Walston) starts scanning the wire for horse races that have just ended, checking the odds of the winner and then he "broadcasts" the race. He must pick a winner with the lowest possible odds so the money to be paid to Lonnegan will be a minimum. When he finds the race, he gives it to Kid Twist (Gould), in the 2nd floor room, and Kid gives it to Lonnegan, who runs to make his bet. Initially they had planned to do it only once but Lonnegan still wants another try, now for $15.000. Even worse, he wants to meet Hooker's man in the wire office. In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those "gamblers" as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan. That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question: how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question: If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them. The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing. And there is of course the well known ragtime piece by Joplin as score. In all, pure, 100%, entertainment. 7/10.

    The Sting is a gem of a movie. Set in 1930's Chicago, this well-told yarn about confidence men at the historical height of the con game features Paul Newman and Robert Redford at the pinnacle of their on screen chemistry. Redford plays Johnny Hooker, the younger, wider-eyed half of the duo, while Newman is Henry Gondorff, the grizzled, worldly mentor. The first con we see Hooker pull off is with his long-time guide and friend, Luther Coleman (played nicely by Robert Earl Jones). The victim of their con turns out to be an employee of Irish mobster Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), who has Luther killed. By Luther's former recommendation, Hooker hooks up with Gondorff to learn the "big con" so that he can take his revenge on Lonnegan for Luther's murder. We are enticed into identifying with these gentler forms of organized criminals, who are pitted against a richer, more connected organized criminal of the vicious, violent kind: "a guy who'd kill a grifter over a chunk of money wouldn't support him for two days." The third segment of this three-part society contains the accomplished, legitimate members, to which the mobsters have closer ties, it would seem, than the less egregiously illegitimate grifters. When Hooker attempts to woo a local bartender, he uses their common outsider status as an inducement: "I'm just like you. It's two in the morning, and I don't know nobody." At first, much of the enjoyment of The Sting comes from being included in the setup of Lonnegan, so dryly played by Shaw that we can't help but root for the colorful cast of con artists to take him down. Eventually, the filmmakers start withholding information about just how the final con is supposed to go down, and it becomes apparent that we have only partly been let in on the full expanse of the big sting. In a sense, we are as much of a mark as Doyle Lonnegan. The film earns our confidence just as Hooker and Gondorff earn Lonnegan's, and the trick is on both of us. When the big event finally comes off, we are as surprised as we are relieved, and the combined effect is extremely satisfying.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford reunite for this Academy Award winning film directed by George Roy Hill about two con men who team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend by "stinging" a mob boss(played by Robert Shaw). Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period. Wouldn't go so far as giving it the best picture award, however, since it is just a good film, not in any way a great one, though it was a big hit at the time.

    I wish films today were made like the ones back in the 1970's because we would get high-quality films that decade got such as this film, The Sting. This film really surprised me because I was expecting a period-piece drama with some action but instead I got a film that is quite funny despite some dramatic moments. This film confused me at times and it will require a second viewing, but that doesn't stop me from really liking this film. George Roy Hill's film is about how two con men, one older and the other young, who team up to set up a big con against a mob boss who murdered a mutual friend of theirs. This film is well-acted. Robert Redford was a young stud back in the day and he shows some fierceness in this role. Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors ever and this film is an example why. However, I really like Charles Durning's performance as the detective. It was funny to see him act like he's boss. Overall, this is a very good con film and it's full of twists and surprises which will come at very unexpecting moments. Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those "gamblers" as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan. That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question: how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question: If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them. The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing. And there is of course the well known ragtime piece by Joplin as score. In all, pure, 100%, entertainment. 7/10.

    The Sting is a gem of a movie. Set in 1930's Chicago, this well-told yarn about confidence men at the historical height of the con game features Paul Newman and Robert Redford at the pinnacle of their on screen chemistry. Redford plays Johnny Hooker, the younger, wider-eyed half of the duo, while Newman is Henry Gondorff, the grizzled, worldly mentor. The first con we see Hooker pull off is with his long-time guide and friend, Luther Coleman (played nicely by Robert Earl Jones). The victim of their con turns out to be an employee of Irish mobster Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), who has Luther killed. By Luther's former recommendation, Hooker hooks up with Gondorff to learn the "big con" so that he can take his revenge on Lonnegan for Luther's murder. We are enticed into identifying with these gentler forms of organized criminals, who are pitted against a richer, more connected organized criminal of the vicious, violent kind: "a guy who'd kill a grifter over a chunk of money wouldn't support him for two days." The third segment of this three-part society contains the accomplished, legitimate members, to which the mobsters have closer ties, it would seem, than the less egregiously illegitimate grifters. When Hooker attempts to woo a local bartender, he uses their common outsider status as an inducement: "I'm just like you. It's two in the morning, and I don't know nobody." At first, much of the enjoyment of The Sting comes from being included in the setup of Lonnegan, so dryly played by Shaw that we can't help but root for the colorful cast of con artists to take him down. Eventually, the filmmakers start withholding information about just how the final con is supposed to go down, and it becomes apparent that we have only partly been let in on the full expanse of the big sting. In a sense, we are as much of a mark as Doyle Lonnegan. The film earns our confidence just as Hooker and Gondorff earn Lonnegan's, and the trick is on both of us. When the big event finally comes off, we are as surprised as we are relieved, and the combined effect is extremely satisfying.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford reunite for this Academy Award winning film directed by George Roy Hill about two con men who team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend by "stinging" a mob boss(played by Robert Shaw). Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period. Wouldn't go so far as giving it the best picture award, however, since it is just a good film, not in any way a great one, though it was a big hit at the time.

    I wish films today were made like the ones back in the 1970's because we would get high-quality films that decade got such as this film, The Sting. This film really surprised me because I was expecting a period-piece drama with some action but instead I got a film that is quite funny despite some dramatic moments. This film confused me at times and it will require a second viewing, but that doesn't stop me from really liking this film. George Roy Hill's film is about how two con men, one older and the other young, who team up to set up a big con against a mob boss who murdered a mutual friend of theirs. This film is well-acted. Robert Redford was a young stud back in the day and he shows some fierceness in this role. Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors ever and this film is an example why. However, I really like Charles Durning's performance as the detective. It was funny to see him act like he's boss. Overall, this is a very good con film and it's full of twists and surprises which will come at very unexpecting moments. Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

    Like Chariots of Fire, The Sting is an undeserving Best Picture winner that owes it's enormous success to its score. In this case, Scott Joplin adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. Inspired by the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)which also featured a popular, Oscar-winning theme, The Sting reunites the director and the 2 stars with diminishing results. Butch Cassidy was diverting, had some charm, and was nice to look at, but The Sting is cloying, claustrophobic, and its charm calculated, and at 129 minutes it seems interminable because nothing in this film about an elaborate con involving good-hearted crooks seems to matter. As for movies dealing with cons, I prefer A Big Hand for a Little Lady, Trick Baby, House of Games, Felini's Il Bidone ("The Swindlers") and even Harry in Your Pocket which was released in 1973 the same year The Sting was named Best Picture while Badlands, Sleeper, Payday, The Homecoming, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Paper Moon, The Last Detail and Serpico were not even nominated for Best Picture

    The Sting succeeds on two levels. It succeeds with it's plot and it succeeds with it's characters. This is a rare feat, since most movies fail on both. The mere suggestion that it's possible to win at gambling is horrendous to many people. But to win by cheating is even more of a crime. However, to those of us who have lost a small sum on a pony or a hand of cards, The Sting is a smug rebuke at the bookies. Paul Newman carries this movie. His pool shooting character Fast Eddie in The Color Of Money, and jail bird, egg-swallowing Luke have matured into an experienced, confident hustler. We don't think of Paul Newman as the king of crime, but he has more cinematic criminal form than Marlon Brando. Paul Newman is the acceptable version of the criminal world, a role taken over by Tom Hanks in Road To Perdition. The movie is about cause and effect. If you do A then B will happen. And it never fails. It's also about making words fail...I've explained that in my review of Titanic. Of course in the real world, something, many things would have gone wrong with the plan in The Sting. Somebody would have sneezed, resulting in a moustache falling off, revealing the entire scam. The whole idea works on the thinnest of error margins. It's quite frightening how the concept of The Sting solidified itself in the real world of finance with the scandals of Enron and the sale of sub-prime mortgage CDO's to unsuspecting investors. The Sting shows how easily people can be fooled by the promise of making a quick buck. A movie to watch once, probably twice, but three times is once too many.

    The Sting is an ideal example of a fun, forgettable comedy. It's reasonably entertaining, it's pretty clever, and it's well acted. It's no masterpiece, and the twists and characters may feel overused now, but The Sting is still a decent way to spend 2 hours. Master con man, Johnny Hooker seeks revenge and reward to scam Doyle Lonnegan, a gang leader who killed Hooker's long time crime partner. Hooker gets the help of Henry Gondorff and others to make this elaborate scheme work. The plot may be paper thin, but The Sting manages to stretch itself to a rather unreasonable 2 hours. Certainly a sub-plot or two could've been removed and shaved off at least half an hour. Despite the length, The Sting is (mostly) entertaining from beginning to end. Production values are high. Cinematography is good, costumes are good, etc. It's hard to pick out a flaw in a movie like this. It's far from perfect, but The Sting makes few stumbles (though the script certainly could've been better). Acting is top notch. Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff pulls off the character well, and Robert Redford completely fades into the role of Johnny Hooker. Robert Shaw portrays a very interesting villain as well. The score (adapted by Marvin Hamlisch) is upbeat and jazzy. Clearly influenced by "The Entertainer," Hamlisch's score is a high point in the film. Besides the fact that's it late and I'm ready to turn in, I find myself with absurdly little to say about The Sting. I was entertained for the better part of 2 hours, and I will be checking out the score. What caused The Sting to be received with such acclaim is beyond me, but there are worse ways to spend a couple hours.

    When Film Fanatics, Critics, and Movie lovers discuss the great Directors, the name George Roy Hill is hardly ever mentioned. Even though he did make two of the most successful and popular Movies ever, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and this overrated Blockbuster. This is not an oversight. It is an insight. While those two mega-hits are above average and entertaining, they hardly can be regarded as groundbreaking Art or Cinema Masterpieces. Artistic achievement and popularity, at times, can be completely out of sync. This is an attractively flat looking, vaguely interesting, audience friendly Movie with high production values and is delivered by Professional Craftsmen, but it is rather unremarkable and has an inoffensive charm that was an against the grain of late 60's and early 70's trend of gritty realism that must have been a breath of fresh air for audiences and Academy voters that were enamored by its sweetness. Nothing here is a turnoff but it is hardly much of a turn on. It remains what it was. Not much more than an entertaining fluff piece with handsome Movie Stars and a slightly engaging story. Kind of a throwback to an era when life was less complicated or it seemed that way at the Movies. It was the Silent Majority that made this a Hit. The Counter Culture was less impressed and in retrospect, they were right.

    I was very pleased with myself, having avoided absolutely everything about this Best Picture-winning classic. I have never seen a Paul Newman film before, and was disappointed by Redford as Gatsby. I didn't even know what this film was about. Absolutely nothing. And it made the film that much better. The Sting is about con men performing 'the long con' on a shady banker, as revenge for a former partner. With throwback title cards we are walked through the process, which comes down to an elaborate gambling hoax. It was a bit frustrating to not know what was going on though. Not even the surface-level plan. And for a modern audience, 'straight poker' is a bit alien. Nonetheless, comprehending the plot is the most thinking you'll have to do during The Sting. Don't expect a life-changing moral or social criticism: entertainment is the goal of this slick, 30's set robbery. Take it at face value, enjoy the genius writing and oh-so-cool leads, fall for every hook and have a few laughs: The Sting is lots of fun, 40 years on. 8.5/10

    Directed by George Roy Hill, "The Sting" is one of the best movies of the 70s and in my opinion cinema history. Justifiably it was winner of Best Picture. It features an outstanding cast, competent settings, costumes, and best of all an exciting storyline. You could point to several stand-out scenes, but my personal favorite was the train set-up with Newman and Shaw. I thought Newman completely nailed it in every respect. Watching cheater Lonigan (Robert Shaw) fume and get cheated at cards with flamboyant and snide Newman was acting at it's all around finest and most entertaining from all involved. This movie is a classic in all regards. It may be easy to guess what's going on but that doesn't really detract from it. Highly Recommended

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own. For one thing, con men here are hunks, come with perfect hair and look like they haven't gone hungry a single day in their lives. And when they groom they look better than a young Bill Clinton. Neither anybody seems to be wanting for a job or going destitute as you don't see scenes so common in movies like Grapes of Wrath, Sullivan's Travels, or even in Stooges shorts, of crowded soup kitchens, lines for the unemployed, etc. Everything and everybody looks slick, clean cut, here and you don't even see any hint of racial segregation or discrimination. Murphy's Law never seems to apply here either: everything goes well for the good guys, even the impossible--escaping hero can pry open a manhole's cover with bare hands and bad guy never bothers to check gambling den between visits, etc. Despite all that the plot is well structured, impeccable in his logic and internal consistencyas long as you don't look too closely--so you may sit and watch TS as you would do with an amusing chess or tennis match. The plot: small time con man Hooker(Redford) unknowingly hits big time hoodlum Lonnegan (Shaw) with a $11.000 loss, along his partner Luther (R.E. Jones), who gets killed as the result. Hooker must run for his life and he comes to seek shelter with retired con man and Luther's good friend Gondorff (Newman) to whom he'll entice to get revenge on Lonnegan by hitting him with a big sting. Most of TS is dedicated to show how such sting unfolds, along with some other subplots, mainly of a corrupt cop who's after Hooker and about some professional assassin hired to kill him too. The FBI also seems implicated, as Special agent Polk (Elcar) sets his sights on Gondorff. Now, all this together put has created confusion for some, so let's go over the essentials. The mechanics of the sting is quite simple: Gondorff's gambling parlor is fake; it only works when Lonnegan visits. When this last arrives at the restaurant, at the time agreed upon, J.J. (Walston) starts scanning the wire for horse races that have just ended, checking the odds of the winner and then he "broadcasts" the race. He must pick a winner with the lowest possible odds so the money to be paid to Lonnegan will be a minimum. When he finds the race, he gives it to Kid Twist (Gould), in the 2nd floor room, and Kid gives it to Lonnegan, who runs to make his bet. Initially they had planned to do it only once but Lonnegan still wants another try, now for $15.000. Even worse, he wants to meet Hooker's man in the wire office. In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those "gamblers" as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan. That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question: how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question: If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them. The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing. And there is of course the well known ragtime piece by Joplin as score. In all, pure, 100%, entertainment. 7/10.

The score (adapted by Marvin Hamlisch) is upbeat and jazzy. Clearly influenced by "The Entertainer," Hamlisch's score is a high point in the film. Besides the fact that's it late and I'm ready to turn in, I find myself with absurdly little to say about The Sting. I was entertained for the better part of 2 hours, and I will be checking out the score. What caused The Sting to be received with such acclaim is beyond me, but there are worse ways to spend a couple hours.

    When Film Fanatics, Critics, and Movie lovers discuss the great Directors, the name George Roy Hill is hardly ever mentioned. Even though he did make two of the most successful and popular Movies ever, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and this overrated Blockbuster. This is not an oversight. It is an insight. While those two mega-hits are above average and entertaining, they hardly can be regarded as groundbreaking Art or Cinema Masterpieces. Artistic achievement and popularity, at times, can be completely out of sync. This is an attractively flat looking, vaguely interesting, audience friendly Movie with high production values and is delivered by Professional Craftsmen, but it is rather unremarkable and has an inoffensive charm that was an against the grain of late 60's and early 70's trend of gritty realism that must have been a breath of fresh air for audiences and Academy voters that were enamored by its sweetness. Nothing here is a turnoff but it is hardly much of a turn on. It remains what it was. Not much more than an entertaining fluff piece with handsome Movie Stars and a slightly engaging story. Kind of a throwback to an era when life was less complicated or it seemed that way at the Movies. It was the Silent Majority that made this a Hit. The Counter Culture was less impressed and in retrospect, they were right.

    I was very pleased with myself, having avoided absolutely everything about this Best Picture-winning classic. I have never seen a Paul Newman film before, and was disappointed by Redford as Gatsby. I didn't even know what this film was about. Absolutely nothing. And it made the film that much better. The Sting is about con men performing 'the long con' on a shady banker, as revenge for a former partner. With throwback title cards we are walked through the process, which comes down to an elaborate gambling hoax. It was a bit frustrating to not know what was going on though. Not even the surface-level plan. And for a modern audience, 'straight poker' is a bit alien. Nonetheless, comprehending the plot is the most thinking you'll have to do during The Sting. Don't expect a life-changing moral or social criticism: entertainment is the goal of this slick, 30's set robbery. Take it at face value, enjoy the genius writing and oh-so-cool leads, fall for every hook and have a few laughs: The Sting is lots of fun, 40 years on. 8.5/10

    Directed by George Roy Hill, "The Sting" is one of the best movies of the 70s and in my opinion cinema history. Justifiably it was winner of Best Picture. It features an outstanding cast, competent settings, costumes, and best of all an exciting storyline. You could point to several stand-out scenes, but my personal favorite was the train set-up with Newman and Shaw. I thought Newman completely nailed it in every respect. Watching cheater Lonigan (Robert Shaw) fume and get cheated at cards with flamboyant and snide Newman was acting at it's all around finest and most entertaining from all involved. This movie is a classic in all regards. It may be easy to guess what's going on but that doesn't really detract from it. Highly Recommended

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own. For one thing, con men here are hunks, come with perfect hair and look like they haven't gone hungry a single day in their lives. And when they groom they look better than a young Bill Clinton. Neither anybody seems to be wanting for a job or going destitute as you don't see scenes so common in movies like Grapes of Wrath, Sullivan's Travels, or even in Stooges shorts, of crowded soup kitchens, lines for the unemployed, etc. Everything and everybody looks slick, clean cut, here and you don't even see any hint of racial segregation or discrimination. Murphy's Law never seems to apply here either: everything goes well for the good guys, even the impossible--escaping hero can pry open a manhole's cover with bare hands and bad guy never bothers to check gambling den between visits, etc. Despite all that the plot is well structured, impeccable in his logic and internal consistencyas long as you don't look too closely--so you may sit and watch TS as you would do with an amusing chess or tennis match. The plot: small time con man Hooker(Redford) unknowingly hits big time hoodlum Lonnegan (Shaw) with a $11.000 loss, along his partner Luther (R.E. Jones), who gets killed as the result. Hooker must run for his life and he comes to seek shelter with retired con man and Luther's good friend Gondorff (Newman) to whom he'll entice to get revenge on Lonnegan by hitting him with a big sting. Most of TS is dedicated to show how such sting unfolds, along with some other subplots, mainly of a corrupt cop who's after Hooker and about some professional assassin hired to kill him too. The FBI also seems implicated, as Special agent Polk (Elcar) sets his sights on Gondorff. Now, all this together put has created confusion for some, so let's go over the essentials. The mechanics of the sting is quite simple: Gondorff's gambling parlor is fake; it only works when Lonnegan visits. When this last arrives at the restaurant, at the time agreed upon, J.J. (Walston) starts scanning the wire for horse races that have just ended, checking the odds of the winner and then he "broadcasts" the race. He must pick a winner with the lowest possible odds so the money to be paid to Lonnegan will be a minimum. When he finds the race, he gives it to Kid Twist (Gould), in the 2nd floor room, and Kid gives it to Lonnegan, who runs to make his bet. Initially they had planned to do it only once but Lonnegan still wants another try, now for $15.000. Even worse, he wants to meet Hooker's man in the wire office. In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those "gamblers" as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan. That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question: how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question: If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them. The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing. And there is of course the well known ragtime piece by Joplin as score. In all, pure, 100%, entertainment. 7/10.

    The Sting is a gem of a movie. Set in 1930's Chicago, this well-told yarn about confidence men at the historical height of the con game features Paul Newman and Robert Redford at the pinnacle of their on screen chemistry. Redford plays Johnny Hooker, the younger, wider-eyed half of the duo, while Newman is Henry Gondorff, the grizzled, worldly mentor. The first con we see Hooker pull off is with his long-time guide and friend, Luther Coleman (played nicely by Robert Earl Jones). The victim of their con turns out to be an employee of Irish mobster Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), who has Luther killed. By Luther's former recommendation, Hooker hooks up with Gondorff to learn the "big con" so that he can take his revenge on Lonnegan for Luther's murder. We are enticed into identifying with these gentler forms of organized criminals, who are pitted against a richer, more connected organized criminal of the vicious, violent kind: "a guy who'd kill a grifter over a chunk of money wouldn't support him for two days." The third segment of this three-part society contains the accomplished, legitimate members, to which the mobsters have closer ties, it would seem, than the less egregiously illegitimate grifters. When Hooker attempts to woo a local bartender, he uses their common outsider status as an inducement: "I'm just like you. It's two in the morning, and I don't know nobody." At first, much of the enjoyment of The Sting comes from being included in the setup of Lonnegan, so dryly played by Shaw that we can't help but root for the colorful cast of con artists to take him down. Eventually, the filmmakers start withholding information about just how the final con is supposed to go down, and it becomes apparent that we have only partly been let in on the full expanse of the big sting. In a sense, we are as much of a mark as Doyle Lonnegan. The film earns our confidence just as Hooker and Gondorff earn Lonnegan's, and the trick is on both of us. When the big event finally comes off, we are as surprised as we are relieved, and the combined effect is extremely satisfying.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford reunite for this Academy Award winning film directed by George Roy Hill about two con men who team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend by "stinging" a mob boss(played by Robert Shaw). Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period. Wouldn't go so far as giving it the best picture award, however, since it is just a good film, not in any way a great one, though it was a big hit at the time.

    I wish films today were made like the ones back in the 1970's because we would get high-quality films that decade got such as this film, The Sting. This film really surprised me because I was expecting a period-piece drama with some action but instead I got a film that is quite funny despite some dramatic moments. This film confused me at times and it will require a second viewing, but that doesn't stop me from really liking this film. George Roy Hill's film is about how two con men, one older and the other young, who team up to set up a big con against a mob boss who murdered a mutual friend of theirs. This film is well-acted. Robert Redford was a young stud back in the day and he shows some fierceness in this role. Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors ever and this film is an example why. However, I really like Charles Durning's performance as the detective. It was funny to see him act like he's boss. Overall, this is a very good con film and it's full of twists and surprises which will come at very unexpecting moments. Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

    Like Chariots of Fire, The Sting is an undeserving Best Picture winner that owes it's enormous success to its score. In this case, Scott Joplin adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. Inspired by the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)which also featured a popular, Oscar-winning theme, The Sting reunites the director and the 2 stars with diminishing results. Butch Cassidy was diverting, had some charm, and was nice to look at, but The Sting is cloying, claustrophobic, and its charm calculated, and at 129 minutes it seems interminable because nothing in this film about an elaborate con involving good-hearted crooks seems to matter. As for movies dealing with cons, I prefer A Big Hand for a Little Lady, Trick Baby, House of Games, Felini's Il Bidone ("The Swindlers") and even Harry in Your Pocket which was released in 1973 the same year The Sting was named Best Picture while Badlands, Sleeper, Payday, The Homecoming, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Paper Moon, The Last Detail and Serpico were not even nominated for Best Picture

    The Sting succeeds on two levels. It succeeds with it's plot and it succeeds with it's characters. This is a rare feat, since most movies fail on both. The mere suggestion that it's possible to win at gambling is horrendous to many people. But to win by cheating is even more of a crime. However, to those of us who have lost a small sum on a pony or a hand of cards, The Sting is a smug rebuke at the bookies. Paul Newman carries this movie. His pool shooting character Fast Eddie in The Color Of Money, and jail bird, egg-swallowing Luke have matured into an experienced, confident hustler. We don't think of Paul Newman as the king of crime, but he has more cinematic criminal form than Marlon Brando. Paul Newman is the acceptable version of the criminal world, a role taken over by Tom Hanks in Road To Perdition. The movie is about cause and effect. If you do A then B will happen. And it never fails. It's also about making words fail...I've explained that in my review of Titanic. Of course in the real world, something, many things would have gone wrong with the plan in The Sting. Somebody would have sneezed, resulting in a moustache falling off, revealing the entire scam. The whole idea works on the thinnest of error margins. It's quite frightening how the concept of The Sting solidified itself in the real world of finance with the scandals of Enron and the sale of sub-prime mortgage CDO's to unsuspecting investors. The Sting shows how easily people can be fooled by the promise of making a quick buck. A movie to watch once, probably twice, but three times is once too many.

    The Sting is an ideal example of a fun, forgettable comedy. It's reasonably entertaining, it's pretty clever, and it's well acted. It's no masterpiece, and the twists and characters may feel overused now, but The Sting is still a decent way to spend 2 hours. Master con man, Johnny Hooker seeks revenge and reward to scam Doyle Lonnegan, a gang leader who killed Hooker's long time crime partner. Hooker gets the help of Henry Gondorff and others to make this elaborate scheme work. The plot may be paper thin, but The Sting manages to stretch itself to a rather unreasonable 2 hours. Certainly a sub-plot or two could've been removed and shaved off at least half an hour. Despite the length, The Sting is (mostly) entertaining from beginning to end. Production values are high. Cinematography is good, costumes are good, etc. It's hard to pick out a flaw in a movie like this. It's far from perfect, but The Sting makes few stumbles (though the script certainly could've been better). Acting is top notch. Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff pulls off the character well, and Robert Redford completely fades into the role of Johnny Hooker. Robert Shaw portrays a very interesting villain as well. The score (adapted by Marvin Hamlisch) is upbeat and jazzy. Clearly influenced by "The Entertainer," Hamlisch's score is a high point in the film. Besides the fact that's it late and I'm ready to turn in, I find myself with absurdly little to say about The Sting. I was entertained for the better part of 2 hours, and I will be checking out the score. What caused The Sting to be received with such acclaim is beyond me, but there are worse ways to spend a couple hours.

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own.

When the big event finally comes off, we are as surprised as we are relieved, and the combined effect is extremely satisfying.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford reunite for this Academy Award winning film directed by George Roy Hill about two con men who team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend by "stinging" a mob boss(played by Robert Shaw). Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period. Wouldn't go so far as giving it the best picture award, however, since it is just a good film, not in any way a great one, though it was a big hit at the time.

    I wish films today were made like the ones back in the 1970's because we would get high-quality films that decade got such as this film, The Sting. This film really surprised me because I was expecting a period-piece drama with some action but instead I got a film that is quite funny despite some dramatic moments. This film confused me at times and it will require a second viewing, but that doesn't stop me from really liking this film. George Roy Hill's film is about how two con men, one older and the other young, who team up to set up a big con against a mob boss who murdered a mutual friend of theirs. This film is well-acted. Robert Redford was a young stud back in the day and he shows some fierceness in this role. Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors ever and this film is an example why. However, I really like Charles Durning's performance as the detective. It was funny to see him act like he's boss. Overall, this is a very good con film and it's full of twists and surprises which will come at very unexpecting moments. Films like this makes me long for the 1970's quality filmmaking that today's directors have come to forget. Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

    Like Chariots of Fire, The Sting is an undeserving Best Picture winner that owes it's enormous success to its score. In this case, Scott Joplin adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. Inspired by the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)which also featured a popular, Oscar-winning theme, The Sting reunites the director and the 2 stars with diminishing results. Butch Cassidy was diverting, had some charm, and was nice to look at, but The Sting is cloying, claustrophobic, and its charm calculated, and at 129 minutes it seems interminable because nothing in this film about an elaborate con involving good-hearted crooks seems to matter. As for movies dealing with cons, I prefer A Big Hand for a Little Lady, Trick Baby, House of Games, Felini's Il Bidone ("The Swindlers") and even Harry in Your Pocket which was released in 1973 the same year The Sting was named Best Picture while Badlands, Sleeper, Payday, The Homecoming, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Paper Moon, The Last Detail and Serpico were not even nominated for Best Picture

    The Sting succeeds on two levels. It succeeds with it's plot and it succeeds with it's characters. This is a rare feat, since most movies fail on both. The mere suggestion that it's possible to win at gambling is horrendous to many people. But to win by cheating is even more of a crime. However, to those of us who have lost a small sum on a pony or a hand of cards, The Sting is a smug rebuke at the bookies. Paul Newman carries this movie. His pool shooting character Fast Eddie in The Color Of Money, and jail bird, egg-swallowing Luke have matured into an experienced, confident hustler. We don't think of Paul Newman as the king of crime, but he has more cinematic criminal form than Marlon Brando. Paul Newman is the acceptable version of the criminal world, a role taken over by Tom Hanks in Road To Perdition. The movie is about cause and effect. If you do A then B will happen. And it never fails. It's also about making words fail...I've explained that in my review of Titanic. Of course in the real world, something, many things would have gone wrong with the plan in The Sting. Somebody would have sneezed, resulting in a moustache falling off, revealing the entire scam. The whole idea works on the thinnest of error margins. It's quite frightening how the concept of The Sting solidified itself in the real world of finance with the scandals of Enron and the sale of sub-prime mortgage CDO's to unsuspecting investors. The Sting shows how easily people can be fooled by the promise of making a quick buck. A movie to watch once, probably twice, but three times is once too many.

    The Sting is an ideal example of a fun, forgettable comedy. It's reasonably entertaining, it's pretty clever, and it's well acted. It's no masterpiece, and the twists and characters may feel overused now, but The Sting is still a decent way to spend 2 hours. Master con man, Johnny Hooker seeks revenge and reward to scam Doyle Lonnegan, a gang leader who killed Hooker's long time crime partner. Hooker gets the help of Henry Gondorff and others to make this elaborate scheme work. The plot may be paper thin, but The Sting manages to stretch itself to a rather unreasonable 2 hours. Certainly a sub-plot or two could've been removed and shaved off at least half an hour. Despite the length, The Sting is (mostly) entertaining from beginning to end. Production values are high. Cinematography is good, costumes are good, etc. It's hard to pick out a flaw in a movie like this. It's far from perfect, but The Sting makes few stumbles (though the script certainly could've been better). Acting is top notch. Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff pulls off the character well, and Robert Redford completely fades into the role of Johnny Hooker. Robert Shaw portrays a very interesting villain as well. The score (adapted by Marvin Hamlisch) is upbeat and jazzy. Clearly influenced by "The Entertainer," Hamlisch's score is a high point in the film. Besides the fact that's it late and I'm ready to turn in, I find myself with absurdly little to say about The Sting. I was entertained for the better part of 2 hours, and I will be checking out the score. What caused The Sting to be received with such acclaim is beyond me, but there are worse ways to spend a couple hours.

    When Film Fanatics, Critics, and Movie lovers discuss the great Directors, the name George Roy Hill is hardly ever mentioned. Even though he did make two of the most successful and popular Movies ever, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and this overrated Blockbuster. This is not an oversight. It is an insight. While those two mega-hits are above average and entertaining, they hardly can be regarded as groundbreaking Art or Cinema Masterpieces. Artistic achievement and popularity, at times, can be completely out of sync. This is an attractively flat looking, vaguely interesting, audience friendly Movie with high production values and is delivered by Professional Craftsmen, but it is rather unremarkable and has an inoffensive charm that was an against the grain of late 60's and early 70's trend of gritty realism that must have been a breath of fresh air for audiences and Academy voters that were enamored by its sweetness. Nothing here is a turnoff but it is hardly much of a turn on. It remains what it was. Not much more than an entertaining fluff piece with handsome Movie Stars and a slightly engaging story. Kind of a throwback to an era when life was less complicated or it seemed that way at the Movies. It was the Silent Majority that made this a Hit. The Counter Culture was less impressed and in retrospect, they were right.

    I was very pleased with myself, having avoided absolutely everything about this Best Picture-winning classic. I have never seen a Paul Newman film before, and was disappointed by Redford as Gatsby. I didn't even know what this film was about. Absolutely nothing. And it made the film that much better. The Sting is about con men performing 'the long con' on a shady banker, as revenge for a former partner. With throwback title cards we are walked through the process, which comes down to an elaborate gambling hoax. It was a bit frustrating to not know what was going on though. Not even the surface-level plan. And for a modern audience, 'straight poker' is a bit alien. Nonetheless, comprehending the plot is the most thinking you'll have to do during The Sting. Don't expect a life-changing moral or social criticism: entertainment is the goal of this slick, 30's set robbery. Take it at face value, enjoy the genius writing and oh-so-cool leads, fall for every hook and have a few laughs: The Sting is lots of fun, 40 years on. 8.5/10

    Directed by George Roy Hill, "The Sting" is one of the best movies of the 70s and in my opinion cinema history. Justifiably it was winner of Best Picture. It features an outstanding cast, competent settings, costumes, and best of all an exciting storyline. You could point to several stand-out scenes, but my personal favorite was the train set-up with Newman and Shaw. I thought Newman completely nailed it in every respect. Watching cheater Lonigan (Robert Shaw) fume and get cheated at cards with flamboyant and snide Newman was acting at it's all around finest and most entertaining from all involved. This movie is a classic in all regards. It may be easy to guess what's going on but that doesn't really detract from it. Highly Recommended

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own. For one thing, con men here are hunks, come with perfect hair and look like they haven't gone hungry a single day in their lives. And when they groom they look better than a young Bill Clinton. Neither anybody seems to be wanting for a job or going destitute as you don't see scenes so common in movies like Grapes of Wrath, Sullivan's Travels, or even in Stooges shorts, of crowded soup kitchens, lines for the unemployed, etc. Everything and everybody looks slick, clean cut, here and you don't even see any hint of racial segregation or discrimination. Murphy's Law never seems to apply here either: everything goes well for the good guys, even the impossible--escaping hero can pry open a manhole's cover with bare hands and bad guy never bothers to check gambling den between visits, etc. Despite all that the plot is well structured, impeccable in his logic and internal consistencyas long as you don't look too closely--so you may sit and watch TS as you would do with an amusing chess or tennis match. The plot: small time con man Hooker(Redford) unknowingly hits big time hoodlum Lonnegan (Shaw) with a $11.000 loss, along his partner Luther (R.E. Jones), who gets killed as the result. Hooker must run for his life and he comes to seek shelter with retired con man and Luther's good friend Gondorff (Newman) to whom he'll entice to get revenge on Lonnegan by hitting him with a big sting. Most of TS is dedicated to show how such sting unfolds, along with some other subplots, mainly of a corrupt cop who's after Hooker and about some professional assassin hired to kill him too. The FBI also seems implicated, as Special agent Polk (Elcar) sets his sights on Gondorff. Now, all this together put has created confusion for some, so let's go over the essentials. The mechanics of the sting is quite simple: Gondorff's gambling parlor is fake; it only works when Lonnegan visits. When this last arrives at the restaurant, at the time agreed upon, J.J. (Walston) starts scanning the wire for horse races that have just ended, checking the odds of the winner and then he "broadcasts" the race. He must pick a winner with the lowest possible odds so the money to be paid to Lonnegan will be a minimum. When he finds the race, he gives it to Kid Twist (Gould), in the 2nd floor room, and Kid gives it to Lonnegan, who runs to make his bet. Initially they had planned to do it only once but Lonnegan still wants another try, now for $15.000. Even worse, he wants to meet Hooker's man in the wire office. In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those "gamblers" as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan. That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question: how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question: If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them. The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing. And there is of course the well known ragtime piece by Joplin as score. In all, pure, 100%, entertainment. 7/10.

    The Sting is a gem of a movie. Set in 1930's Chicago, this well-told yarn about confidence men at the historical height of the con game features Paul Newman and Robert Redford at the pinnacle of their on screen chemistry. Redford plays Johnny Hooker, the younger, wider-eyed half of the duo, while Newman is Henry Gondorff, the grizzled, worldly mentor. The first con we see Hooker pull off is with his long-time guide and friend, Luther Coleman (played nicely by Robert Earl Jones). The victim of their con turns out to be an employee of Irish mobster Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), who has Luther killed. By Luther's former recommendation, Hooker hooks up with Gondorff to learn the "big con" so that he can take his revenge on Lonnegan for Luther's murder. We are enticed into identifying with these gentler forms of organized criminals, who are pitted against a richer, more connected organized criminal of the vicious, violent kind: "a guy who'd kill a grifter over a chunk of money wouldn't support him for two days." The third segment of this three-part society contains the accomplished, legitimate members, to which the mobsters have closer ties, it would seem, than the less egregiously illegitimate grifters. When Hooker attempts to woo a local bartender, he uses their common outsider status as an inducement: "I'm just like you. It's two in the morning, and I don't know nobody." At first, much of the enjoyment of The Sting comes from being included in the setup of Lonnegan, so dryly played by Shaw that we can't help but root for the colorful cast of con artists to take him down. Eventually, the filmmakers start withholding information about just how the final con is supposed to go down, and it becomes apparent that we have only partly been let in on the full expanse of the big sting. In a sense, we are as much of a mark as Doyle Lonnegan. The film earns our confidence just as Hooker and Gondorff earn Lonnegan's, and the trick is on both of us. When the big event finally comes off, we are as surprised as we are relieved, and the combined effect is extremely satisfying.

Don't get me wrong, I like today's films very much, but I wish these kind of films were still being made. I rate this film 9/10.

This movie is a classic in all regards. It may be easy to guess what's going on but that doesn't really detract from it. Highly Recommended

    Smart and slick entertainment, but don't look for any philosophical depth here.

    This is a very well made flick; almost a perfect one, technically, but also one which merits lie exclusively in its value as an entertainment vehicle, so don't come here looking for answers to the big questions of life, for philosophical or spiritual enlightenment or for education on the Great Depression. TS unfolds in a different universe, one which has only a passing resemblance to our own. For one thing, con men here are hunks, come with perfect hair and look like they haven't gone hungry a single day in their lives. And when they groom they look better than a young Bill Clinton. Neither anybody seems to be wanting for a job or going destitute as you don't see scenes so common in movies like Grapes of Wrath, Sullivan's Travels, or even in Stooges shorts, of crowded soup kitchens, lines for the unemployed, etc. Everything and everybody looks slick, clean cut, here and you don't even see any hint of racial segregation or discrimination. Murphy's Law never seems to apply here either: everything goes well for the good guys, even the impossible--escaping hero can pry open a manhole's cover with bare hands and bad guy never bothers to check gambling den between visits, etc. Despite all that the plot is well structured, impeccable in his logic and internal consistencyas long as you don't look too closely--so you may sit and watch TS as you would do with an amusing chess or tennis match. The plot: small time con man Hooker(Redford) unknowingly hits big time hoodlum Lonnegan (Shaw) with a $11.000 loss, along his partner Luther (R.E. Jones), who gets killed as the result. Hooker must run for his life and he comes to seek shelter with retired con man and Luther's good friend Gondorff (Newman) to whom he'll entice to get revenge on Lonnegan by hitting him with a big sting. Most of TS is dedicated to show how such sting unfolds, along with some other subplots, mainly of a corrupt cop who's after Hooker and about some professional assassin hired to kill him too. The FBI also seems implicated, as Special agent Polk (Elcar) sets his sights on Gondorff. Now, all this together put has created confusion for some, so let's go over the essentials. The mechanics of the sting is quite simple: Gondorff's gambling parlor is fake; it only works when Lonnegan visits. When this last arrives at the restaurant, at the time agreed upon, J.J. (Walston) starts scanning the wire for horse races that have just ended, checking the odds of the winner and then he "broadcasts" the race. He must pick a winner with the lowest possible odds so the money to be paid to Lonnegan will be a minimum. When he finds the race, he gives it to Kid Twist (Gould), in the 2nd floor room, and Kid gives it to Lonnegan, who runs to make his bet. Initially they had planned to do it only once but Lonnegan still wants another try, now for $15.000. Even worse, he wants to meet Hooker's man in the wire office. In that meeting, both Hooker and Kid try to dissuade him from making still another (small) bet, but he won't budge. At his 2nd visit to the betting joint J.J. has trouble getting races with odds lower than 4-1 (at 94 min.) so Gondorff decides to keep Lonnegan from betting--he can't possibly pay him $60.000! Finally J.J. finds a winner (Wrecking Crew, 3-1) but the men block Lonnegan anyway. The tip was good though, so Lonnegan decides to go for it. This is how the scam works, but how Lonnegan sees it? He knows how the parlor works because Hooker had told him, but he sees all those "gamblers" as suckers being fleeced, so he wants to move in, take over. Hooker told him also he had sure tips because he was short-circuiting the wire results. So everything is set for the sting on Lonnegan. That's the plot of the scam. But that's not all, even if you'll be probably too busy following the action to ask a crucial question: how do they plan to rob Lonnegan without he noticing? We get the answer later, as we see Lt. Snyder playing a crucial role, but I still have myself a question: If Gondorff didn't realize that Snyder was after Hooker until the operation was under way, how he had planned to do things before it, as he couldn't possibly have included the cop in the initial plan?. In any case the overall logical structure of the story is flawless, everything comes to fit to perfection, if you only assume that Gondorff, Hooker & ass. are so lucky that everything works out perfectly for them. The cinematography is good, even if some sets look rather cheap to me. Camera work simple but effective. Directing tight but somewhat loose with the two leads. The acting is excellent by most, but Redford's Hooker looks ever too happy and self satisfied for a child of the Great Depression and Newman's Gondorff's too cocky and self assured, as if he had already read the whole script. That takes a lot of tension off even more with the complete lack of character development. Pacing and plot development impeccable and so the editing. And there is of course the well known ragtime piece by Joplin as score. In all, pure, 100%, entertainment. 7/10.

    The Sting is a gem of a movie. Set in 1930's Chicago, this well-told yarn about confidence men at the historical height of the con game features Paul Newman and Robert Redford at the pinnacle of their on screen chemistry. Redford plays Johnny Hooker, the younger, wider-eyed half of the duo, while Newman is Henry Gondorff, the grizzled, worldly mentor. The first con we see Hooker pull off is with his long-time guide and friend, Luther Coleman (played nicely by Robert Earl Jones). The victim of their con turns out to be an employee of Irish mobster Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), who has Luther killed. By Luther's former recommendation, Hooker hooks up with Gondorff to learn the "big con" so that he can take his revenge on Lonnegan for Luther's murder. We are enticed into identifying with these gentler forms of organized criminals, who are pitted against a richer, more connected organized criminal of the vicious, violent kind: "a guy who'd kill a grifter over a chunk of money wouldn't support him for two days." The third segment of this three-part society contains the accomplished, legitimate members, to which the mobsters have closer ties, it would seem, than the less egregiously illegitimate grifters. When Hooker attempts to woo a local bartender, he uses their common outsider status as an inducement: "I'm just like you. It's two in the morning, and I don't know nobody." At first, much of the enjoyment of The Sting comes from being included in the setup of Lonnegan, so dryly played by Shaw that we can't help but root for the colorful cast of con artists to take him down. Eventually, the filmmakers start withholding information about just how the final con is supposed to go down, and it becomes apparent that we have only partly been let in on the full expanse of the big sting. In a sense, we are as much of a mark as Doyle Lonnegan. The film earns our confidence just as Hooker and Gondorff earn Lonnegan's, and the trick is on both of us. When the big event finally comes off, we are as surprised as we are relieved, and the combined effect is extremely satisfying.
