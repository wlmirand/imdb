    The first thought that came across my head when I started watching this movie was " These two remind me of Dexter and Hannah!" For all you Dexter buffs out their then you know how Hannah brings out the best in Dexter and his situation while Dexter does the same. If I could write a essay about couples bringing the best out of each other or helping each other I think I would create a pretty good essay with the help of this movie and Dexter! If you love movies that are sweet and are realistic in it's dramatic display you will just adore this movie and I recommend it to anyone! And also Mariska Hargitay the actress who plays Detective Olivia Benson from Law and Order: SVU is in this movie in a few short clips. One downfall about this movie I would have to say is The soundtrack was creepy at some parts and they repeated to many songs but movies can't be perfect.

    When speaking of Nicolas Cage, most people wouldn't define him as a good actor. Still, he has had some roles in great movies and he takes his job very seriously. That's probably one of the reasons why he won an Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas for best actor  he prepared for his role by binge drinking, visiting hospitalised alcoholics and filming himself drunk to study his speech patterns. Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced, broke alcoholic who just got fired because of his addiction. He decides to take all his money and move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One evening he meets a prostitute, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), and pays her to keep him company. After her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is killed, Ben moves in with Sera and they start a strange relationship, agreeing they won't try to change each other. Leaving Las Vegas is not a movie for everyone: it's a depressive story about two good people who realise they are doomed and there's no point in fighting for a change. Ben and Sera feel good when they are together, but Ben can't abandon his addiction, and Sera her job. It also features uneasy scenes of sex, alcoholism and chaos. The movie manages to remind us what a horrible and dangerous disease alcoholism is, mostly thanks to Cage's great performance. Shue is also great as the prostitute Sera, especially when she has to carry the movie, when the story focuses on her because Ben has briefly disappeared. Their impossible love is so believable it's almost painful. The cinematography fits the depressing tone of the movie: almost everything takes place at night, in a city full of lights that don't comfort, or in dark and small rooms  particularly while Ben is suffering the consequences of abstinence, the rooms begin looking claustrophobic, as if there was less and less air with each second that passes. The director Mike Figgis also wrote the music and even played some of the instruments for the soundtrack: his jazz fits the Las Vegas atmosphere beautifully. All in all, you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie since it can easily make you cry, but it's totally worth your time. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters. Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other. The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession. Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, "You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness." So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what. I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this? Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again. On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction. Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.

    Directed by Mike Figgis, "Leaving Las Vegas" stars a scenery chewing Nicholas Cage as a jobless alcoholic whose wife and family have abandoned him. Depressed, and looking to commit suicide, Cage pumps his entire life's savings into one last Las Vegas trip. Here he will consume copious amounts of alcohol and then die. At least that's the plan. Much of the film watches as Cage strikes up an impromptu relationship with a local prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). They form a bond of understanding, mutual acceptance and perhaps unconditional love. Figgis then clashes many moments of romanticised self-pity with Las Vegan grime and sleaze. This is Neil Jordan, Abel Ferrara territory, the director trying to paint a darkly glamorous fairy tale against a sordid backdrop. It works, but this is still an overly sentimental, overly piteous tale, and none of Figgis' characters or relationships are psychological plausible. People don't behave quite this way, Shue plays the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold clich&eacute;, and Cage paradoxically plays a suicidal depressive who's charming and in love with life. It's all a giant writer's fantasy. Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was "asking for" rape. Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines  she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips  but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls. The film seems to use "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago". Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion. The film was shot in Super-16. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. See "The Cooler" and "In a Lonely Place".

    Spoiler: An alcoholic (sacked) screenwriter and an abused prostitute find true love in Las Vegas. Except she gets gang raped and he dies. Apparently John O'Brien, the author of the novel, killed himself while the movie was in production. Mike Figgis may or may not have let him in to see the rushes. Oh God, it's Mike Figgis again. I caught this pile of tripe on a low-rent TV channel, and it occurred to me that the L'Oreal ads with over-lit, over-made-up, underdressed models were more realistic than this trite, shallow, exploitative pile of garbage. The Mike Figgis checklist: 1. Completely static character arcs? Check. 2. Characters behave idiotically in order to advance story? Check. 3. Characters suffering physical injury or abuse come back stronger than ever in a day or two? Check. If you want to hear Nicolas 'Oscar for doing retard' (alcoholic counts) Cage and Elisabeth Shue saying naughty words then Leaving Las Vegas is for you. If you have any discernment whatever is isn't.

    Leaving Las Vegas is a romantic drama film based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue, which forms the center of the film.It is written and directed by Mike Figgis. The film tells a story of a a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera, failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees.This charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness. Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, this multi- nuanced portrait of an alcoholic is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.As far as the acting is concerned, this uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story is sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.And most of all,it pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.

    Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?

    A somewhat idealised account of alcoholism, but still a thoroughly downbeat one

    Don't get me wrong, this film is thoroughly downbeat, however I feel alcoholism is still slightly sugar coated. The likelihood of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) finding a woman as attractive and utterly devoted as Sera (Elizabeth Shue) is slim. It's possible of course, their bond is understandable; they're both people in grave need of care, one being a severe addict and the other being a victim on the fringe of society. Also, the crucial element that makes the relationship and indeed the film work is its platonicism. Nevertheless, I thought that 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a somewhat idealised account of dire alcoholism. This really struck me in an erotically charged scene in which the pair kiss and caress each other with the help of a large bottle of liquor - it's an image that would exist merely in the dreams of most addicts. However, the engaging central romance certainly beats 2 hours of a more ordinary dive into alcoholism, which would be a film of roughly two sets: a pub and a bedroom stained with urine, excrement, blood and vomit. A film of this nature depends on a good central performance, and it gets one. Cage is depressingly real and effective as Ben. I am a fan of many of Cage's unhinged roles, however 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one the films that proves that when he moderates his idiosyncratic lunacy, he can produce genuinely good, measured performances. The film is scored with smooth, melancholic Jazz tracks and the narrative is constructed by a tautly composed prologue which gives a brief insight into Ben's life before he left for Las Vegas. This includes a brilliant scene of Ben ridding himself of his personal and professional existence to the sound of Michael McDonald's energetic 'Lonely Teardrops'. It's a scene of mixed emotions, although he is condemning himself, it is also an act of liberation. Not much detail is given about his life in the prologue, however it is clear that he was a popular and successful family man. When he is fired, his boss says with a touching sincerity 'we enjoyed having you around here, but you know how it is', giving him a cheque which Ben describes as 'too generous'. This depth given to Cage's character makes his decline all the more tragic. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is dark, seedy and tragic. Recommended. www.hawkensian.com

    A good, daring and courageous film. I have to say I have hardly ever seen such an "open" American film, so very non-Hollywoodlike. Exemplifying the film's bluntness is a phrase by Shue: "The only thing waiting for me when I get back home is mouth wash, to wash away the taste of sperm". It's a pity really, this could have been a groundbreaking, excellent film if the screenplay had paid a little more attention to the why's and how's, and tried to be a little more realistic about the quantity Cage drinks, which is unreasonable. It also goes a little "over the top" in some scenes which was not necessary. Otherwise, great performances by both lead actors, very deserving of the Oscar awarded to Nicholas Cage.

    Directed by Mike Figgis, "Leaving Las Vegas" stars a scenery chewing Nicholas Cage as a jobless alcoholic whose wife and family have abandoned him. Depressed, and looking to commit suicide, Cage pumps his entire life's savings into one last Las Vegas trip. Here he will consume copious amounts of alcohol and then die. At least that's the plan. Much of the film watches as Cage strikes up an impromptu relationship with a local prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). They form a bond of understanding, mutual acceptance and perhaps unconditional love. Figgis then clashes many moments of romanticised self-pity with Las Vegan grime and sleaze. This is Neil Jordan, Abel Ferrara territory, the director trying to paint a darkly glamorous fairy tale against a sordid backdrop. It works, but this is still an overly sentimental, overly piteous tale, and none of Figgis' characters or relationships are psychological plausible. People don't behave quite this way, Shue plays the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold clich&eacute;, and Cage paradoxically plays a suicidal depressive who's charming and in love with life. It's all a giant writer's fantasy. Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was "asking for" rape. Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines  she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips  but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls. The film seems to use "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago". Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion. The film was shot in Super-16. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. See "The Cooler" and "In a Lonely Place".

    Spoiler: An alcoholic (sacked) screenwriter and an abused prostitute find true love in Las Vegas. Except she gets gang raped and he dies. Apparently John O'Brien, the author of the novel, killed himself while the movie was in production. Mike Figgis may or may not have let him in to see the rushes. Oh God, it's Mike Figgis again. I caught this pile of tripe on a low-rent TV channel, and it occurred to me that the L'Oreal ads with over-lit, over-made-up, underdressed models were more realistic than this trite, shallow, exploitative pile of garbage. The Mike Figgis checklist: 1. Completely static character arcs? Check. 2. Characters behave idiotically in order to advance story? Check. 3. Characters suffering physical injury or abuse come back stronger than ever in a day or two? Check. If you want to hear Nicolas 'Oscar for doing retard' (alcoholic counts) Cage and Elisabeth Shue saying naughty words then Leaving Las Vegas is for you. If you have any discernment whatever is isn't.

    Leaving Las Vegas is a romantic drama film based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue, which forms the center of the film.It is written and directed by Mike Figgis. The film tells a story of a a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera, failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees.This charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness. Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, this multi- nuanced portrait of an alcoholic is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.As far as the acting is concerned, this uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story is sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.And most of all,it pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.

    Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?

    Don't get me wrong, this film is thoroughly downbeat, however I feel alcoholism is still slightly sugar coated. The likelihood of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) finding a woman as attractive and utterly devoted as Sera (Elizabeth Shue) is slim. It's possible of course, their bond is understandable; they're both people in grave need of care, one being a severe addict and the other being a victim on the fringe of society. Also, the crucial element that makes the relationship and indeed the film work is its platonicism. Nevertheless, I thought that 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a somewhat idealised account of dire alcoholism. This really struck me in an erotically charged scene in which the pair kiss and caress each other with the help of a large bottle of liquor - it's an image that would exist merely in the dreams of most addicts. However, the engaging central romance certainly beats 2 hours of a more ordinary dive into alcoholism, which would be a film of roughly two sets: a pub and a bedroom stained with urine, excrement, blood and vomit. A film of this nature depends on a good central performance, and it gets one. Cage is depressingly real and effective as Ben. I am a fan of many of Cage's unhinged roles, however 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one the films that proves that when he moderates his idiosyncratic lunacy, he can produce genuinely good, measured performances. The film is scored with smooth, melancholic Jazz tracks and the narrative is constructed by a tautly composed prologue which gives a brief insight into Ben's life before he left for Las Vegas. This includes a brilliant scene of Ben ridding himself of his personal and professional existence to the sound of Michael McDonald's energetic 'Lonely Teardrops'. It's a scene of mixed emotions, although he is condemning himself, it is also an act of liberation. Not much detail is given about his life in the prologue, however it is clear that he was a popular and successful family man. When he is fired, his boss says with a touching sincerity 'we enjoyed having you around here, but you know how it is', giving him a cheque which Ben describes as 'too generous'. This depth given to Cage's character makes his decline all the more tragic. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is dark, seedy and tragic. Recommended. www.hawkensian.com

    A good, daring and courageous film. I have to say I have hardly ever seen such an "open" American film, so very non-Hollywoodlike. Exemplifying the film's bluntness is a phrase by Shue: "The only thing waiting for me when I get back home is mouth wash, to wash away the taste of sperm". It's a pity really, this could have been a groundbreaking, excellent film if the screenplay had paid a little more attention to the why's and how's, and tried to be a little more realistic about the quantity Cage drinks, which is unreasonable. It also goes a little "over the top" in some scenes which was not necessary. Otherwise, great performances by both lead actors, very deserving of the Oscar awarded to Nicholas Cage.

    The first thought that came across my head when I started watching this movie was " These two remind me of Dexter and Hannah!" For all you Dexter buffs out their then you know how Hannah brings out the best in Dexter and his situation while Dexter does the same. If I could write a essay about couples bringing the best out of each other or helping each other I think I would create a pretty good essay with the help of this movie and Dexter! If you love movies that are sweet and are realistic in it's dramatic display you will just adore this movie and I recommend it to anyone! And also Mariska Hargitay the actress who plays Detective Olivia Benson from Law and Order: SVU is in this movie in a few short clips. One downfall about this movie I would have to say is The soundtrack was creepy at some parts and they repeated to many songs but movies can't be perfect.

    When speaking of Nicolas Cage, most people wouldn't define him as a good actor. Still, he has had some roles in great movies and he takes his job very seriously. That's probably one of the reasons why he won an Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas for best actor  he prepared for his role by binge drinking, visiting hospitalised alcoholics and filming himself drunk to study his speech patterns. Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced, broke alcoholic who just got fired because of his addiction. He decides to take all his money and move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One evening he meets a prostitute, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), and pays her to keep him company. After her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is killed, Ben moves in with Sera and they start a strange relationship, agreeing they won't try to change each other. Leaving Las Vegas is not a movie for everyone: it's a depressive story about two good people who realise they are doomed and there's no point in fighting for a change. Ben and Sera feel good when they are together, but Ben can't abandon his addiction, and Sera her job. It also features uneasy scenes of sex, alcoholism and chaos. The movie manages to remind us what a horrible and dangerous disease alcoholism is, mostly thanks to Cage's great performance. Shue is also great as the prostitute Sera, especially when she has to carry the movie, when the story focuses on her because Ben has briefly disappeared. Their impossible love is so believable it's almost painful. The cinematography fits the depressing tone of the movie: almost everything takes place at night, in a city full of lights that don't comfort, or in dark and small rooms  particularly while Ben is suffering the consequences of abstinence, the rooms begin looking claustrophobic, as if there was less and less air with each second that passes. The director Mike Figgis also wrote the music and even played some of the instruments for the soundtrack: his jazz fits the Las Vegas atmosphere beautifully. All in all, you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie since it can easily make you cry, but it's totally worth your time. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters. Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other. The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession. Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, "You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness." So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what. I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this? Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again. On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction. Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.

Exemplifying the film's bluntness is a phrase by Shue: "The only thing waiting for me when I get back home is mouth wash, to wash away the taste of sperm". It's a pity really, this could have been a groundbreaking, excellent film if the screenplay had paid a little more attention to the why's and how's, and tried to be a little more realistic about the quantity Cage drinks, which is unreasonable. It also goes a little "over the top" in some scenes which was not necessary. Otherwise, great performances by both lead actors, very deserving of the Oscar awarded to Nicholas Cage.

    The first thought that came across my head when I started watching this movie was " These two remind me of Dexter and Hannah!" For all you Dexter buffs out their then you know how Hannah brings out the best in Dexter and his situation while Dexter does the same. If I could write a essay about couples bringing the best out of each other or helping each other I think I would create a pretty good essay with the help of this movie and Dexter! If you love movies that are sweet and are realistic in it's dramatic display you will just adore this movie and I recommend it to anyone! And also Mariska Hargitay the actress who plays Detective Olivia Benson from Law and Order: SVU is in this movie in a few short clips. One downfall about this movie I would have to say is The soundtrack was creepy at some parts and they repeated to many songs but movies can't be perfect.

    When speaking of Nicolas Cage, most people wouldn't define him as a good actor. Still, he has had some roles in great movies and he takes his job very seriously. That's probably one of the reasons why he won an Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas for best actor  he prepared for his role by binge drinking, visiting hospitalised alcoholics and filming himself drunk to study his speech patterns. Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced, broke alcoholic who just got fired because of his addiction. He decides to take all his money and move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One evening he meets a prostitute, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), and pays her to keep him company. After her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is killed, Ben moves in with Sera and they start a strange relationship, agreeing they won't try to change each other. Leaving Las Vegas is not a movie for everyone: it's a depressive story about two good people who realise they are doomed and there's no point in fighting for a change. Ben and Sera feel good when they are together, but Ben can't abandon his addiction, and Sera her job. It also features uneasy scenes of sex, alcoholism and chaos. The movie manages to remind us what a horrible and dangerous disease alcoholism is, mostly thanks to Cage's great performance. Shue is also great as the prostitute Sera, especially when she has to carry the movie, when the story focuses on her because Ben has briefly disappeared. Their impossible love is so believable it's almost painful. The cinematography fits the depressing tone of the movie: almost everything takes place at night, in a city full of lights that don't comfort, or in dark and small rooms  particularly while Ben is suffering the consequences of abstinence, the rooms begin looking claustrophobic, as if there was less and less air with each second that passes. The director Mike Figgis also wrote the music and even played some of the instruments for the soundtrack: his jazz fits the Las Vegas atmosphere beautifully. All in all, you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie since it can easily make you cry, but it's totally worth your time. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters. Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other. The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession. Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, "You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness." So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what. I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this? Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again. On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction. Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.

    Directed by Mike Figgis, "Leaving Las Vegas" stars a scenery chewing Nicholas Cage as a jobless alcoholic whose wife and family have abandoned him. Depressed, and looking to commit suicide, Cage pumps his entire life's savings into one last Las Vegas trip. Here he will consume copious amounts of alcohol and then die. At least that's the plan. Much of the film watches as Cage strikes up an impromptu relationship with a local prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). They form a bond of understanding, mutual acceptance and perhaps unconditional love. Figgis then clashes many moments of romanticised self-pity with Las Vegan grime and sleaze. This is Neil Jordan, Abel Ferrara territory, the director trying to paint a darkly glamorous fairy tale against a sordid backdrop. It works, but this is still an overly sentimental, overly piteous tale, and none of Figgis' characters or relationships are psychological plausible. People don't behave quite this way, Shue plays the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold clich&eacute;, and Cage paradoxically plays a suicidal depressive who's charming and in love with life. It's all a giant writer's fantasy. Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was "asking for" rape. Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines  she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips  but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls. The film seems to use "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago". Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion. The film was shot in Super-16. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. See "The Cooler" and "In a Lonely Place".

    Spoiler: An alcoholic (sacked) screenwriter and an abused prostitute find true love in Las Vegas. Except she gets gang raped and he dies. Apparently John O'Brien, the author of the novel, killed himself while the movie was in production. Mike Figgis may or may not have let him in to see the rushes. Oh God, it's Mike Figgis again. I caught this pile of tripe on a low-rent TV channel, and it occurred to me that the L'Oreal ads with over-lit, over-made-up, underdressed models were more realistic than this trite, shallow, exploitative pile of garbage. The Mike Figgis checklist: 1. Completely static character arcs? Check. 2. Characters behave idiotically in order to advance story? Check. 3. Characters suffering physical injury or abuse come back stronger than ever in a day or two? Check. If you want to hear Nicolas 'Oscar for doing retard' (alcoholic counts) Cage and Elisabeth Shue saying naughty words then Leaving Las Vegas is for you. If you have any discernment whatever is isn't.

    Leaving Las Vegas is a romantic drama film based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue, which forms the center of the film.It is written and directed by Mike Figgis. The film tells a story of a a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera, failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees.This charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness. Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, this multi- nuanced portrait of an alcoholic is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.As far as the acting is concerned, this uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story is sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.And most of all,it pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.

    Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?

    Don't get me wrong, this film is thoroughly downbeat, however I feel alcoholism is still slightly sugar coated. The likelihood of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) finding a woman as attractive and utterly devoted as Sera (Elizabeth Shue) is slim. It's possible of course, their bond is understandable; they're both people in grave need of care, one being a severe addict and the other being a victim on the fringe of society. Also, the crucial element that makes the relationship and indeed the film work is its platonicism. Nevertheless, I thought that 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a somewhat idealised account of dire alcoholism. This really struck me in an erotically charged scene in which the pair kiss and caress each other with the help of a large bottle of liquor - it's an image that would exist merely in the dreams of most addicts. However, the engaging central romance certainly beats 2 hours of a more ordinary dive into alcoholism, which would be a film of roughly two sets: a pub and a bedroom stained with urine, excrement, blood and vomit. A film of this nature depends on a good central performance, and it gets one. Cage is depressingly real and effective as Ben. I am a fan of many of Cage's unhinged roles, however 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one the films that proves that when he moderates his idiosyncratic lunacy, he can produce genuinely good, measured performances. The film is scored with smooth, melancholic Jazz tracks and the narrative is constructed by a tautly composed prologue which gives a brief insight into Ben's life before he left for Las Vegas. This includes a brilliant scene of Ben ridding himself of his personal and professional existence to the sound of Michael McDonald's energetic 'Lonely Teardrops'. It's a scene of mixed emotions, although he is condemning himself, it is also an act of liberation. Not much detail is given about his life in the prologue, however it is clear that he was a popular and successful family man. When he is fired, his boss says with a touching sincerity 'we enjoyed having you around here, but you know how it is', giving him a cheque which Ben describes as 'too generous'. This depth given to Cage's character makes his decline all the more tragic. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is dark, seedy and tragic. Recommended. www.hawkensian.com

It's all a giant writer's fantasy. Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was "asking for" rape. Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines  she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips  but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls. The film seems to use "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago". Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion. The film was shot in Super-16. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. See "The Cooler" and "In a Lonely Place".

    Spoiler: An alcoholic (sacked) screenwriter and an abused prostitute find true love in Las Vegas. Except she gets gang raped and he dies. Apparently John O'Brien, the author of the novel, killed himself while the movie was in production. Mike Figgis may or may not have let him in to see the rushes. Oh God, it's Mike Figgis again. I caught this pile of tripe on a low-rent TV channel, and it occurred to me that the L'Oreal ads with over-lit, over-made-up, underdressed models were more realistic than this trite, shallow, exploitative pile of garbage. The Mike Figgis checklist: 1. Completely static character arcs? Check. 2. Characters behave idiotically in order to advance story? Check. 3. Characters suffering physical injury or abuse come back stronger than ever in a day or two? Check. If you want to hear Nicolas 'Oscar for doing retard' (alcoholic counts) Cage and Elisabeth Shue saying naughty words then Leaving Las Vegas is for you. If you have any discernment whatever is isn't.

    Leaving Las Vegas is a romantic drama film based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue, which forms the center of the film.It is written and directed by Mike Figgis. The film tells a story of a a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera, failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees.This charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness. Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, this multi- nuanced portrait of an alcoholic is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.As far as the acting is concerned, this uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story is sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.And most of all,it pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.

    Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?

    Don't get me wrong, this film is thoroughly downbeat, however I feel alcoholism is still slightly sugar coated. The likelihood of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) finding a woman as attractive and utterly devoted as Sera (Elizabeth Shue) is slim. It's possible of course, their bond is understandable; they're both people in grave need of care, one being a severe addict and the other being a victim on the fringe of society. Also, the crucial element that makes the relationship and indeed the film work is its platonicism. Nevertheless, I thought that 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a somewhat idealised account of dire alcoholism. This really struck me in an erotically charged scene in which the pair kiss and caress each other with the help of a large bottle of liquor - it's an image that would exist merely in the dreams of most addicts. However, the engaging central romance certainly beats 2 hours of a more ordinary dive into alcoholism, which would be a film of roughly two sets: a pub and a bedroom stained with urine, excrement, blood and vomit. A film of this nature depends on a good central performance, and it gets one. Cage is depressingly real and effective as Ben. I am a fan of many of Cage's unhinged roles, however 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one the films that proves that when he moderates his idiosyncratic lunacy, he can produce genuinely good, measured performances. The film is scored with smooth, melancholic Jazz tracks and the narrative is constructed by a tautly composed prologue which gives a brief insight into Ben's life before he left for Las Vegas. This includes a brilliant scene of Ben ridding himself of his personal and professional existence to the sound of Michael McDonald's energetic 'Lonely Teardrops'. It's a scene of mixed emotions, although he is condemning himself, it is also an act of liberation. Not much detail is given about his life in the prologue, however it is clear that he was a popular and successful family man. When he is fired, his boss says with a touching sincerity 'we enjoyed having you around here, but you know how it is', giving him a cheque which Ben describes as 'too generous'. This depth given to Cage's character makes his decline all the more tragic. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is dark, seedy and tragic. Recommended. www.hawkensian.com

    A good, daring and courageous film. I have to say I have hardly ever seen such an "open" American film, so very non-Hollywoodlike. Exemplifying the film's bluntness is a phrase by Shue: "The only thing waiting for me when I get back home is mouth wash, to wash away the taste of sperm". It's a pity really, this could have been a groundbreaking, excellent film if the screenplay had paid a little more attention to the why's and how's, and tried to be a little more realistic about the quantity Cage drinks, which is unreasonable. It also goes a little "over the top" in some scenes which was not necessary. Otherwise, great performances by both lead actors, very deserving of the Oscar awarded to Nicholas Cage.

    The first thought that came across my head when I started watching this movie was " These two remind me of Dexter and Hannah!" For all you Dexter buffs out their then you know how Hannah brings out the best in Dexter and his situation while Dexter does the same. If I could write a essay about couples bringing the best out of each other or helping each other I think I would create a pretty good essay with the help of this movie and Dexter! If you love movies that are sweet and are realistic in it's dramatic display you will just adore this movie and I recommend it to anyone! And also Mariska Hargitay the actress who plays Detective Olivia Benson from Law and Order: SVU is in this movie in a few short clips. One downfall about this movie I would have to say is The soundtrack was creepy at some parts and they repeated to many songs but movies can't be perfect.

    When speaking of Nicolas Cage, most people wouldn't define him as a good actor. Still, he has had some roles in great movies and he takes his job very seriously. That's probably one of the reasons why he won an Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas for best actor  he prepared for his role by binge drinking, visiting hospitalised alcoholics and filming himself drunk to study his speech patterns. Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced, broke alcoholic who just got fired because of his addiction. He decides to take all his money and move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One evening he meets a prostitute, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), and pays her to keep him company. After her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is killed, Ben moves in with Sera and they start a strange relationship, agreeing they won't try to change each other. Leaving Las Vegas is not a movie for everyone: it's a depressive story about two good people who realise they are doomed and there's no point in fighting for a change. Ben and Sera feel good when they are together, but Ben can't abandon his addiction, and Sera her job. It also features uneasy scenes of sex, alcoholism and chaos. The movie manages to remind us what a horrible and dangerous disease alcoholism is, mostly thanks to Cage's great performance. Shue is also great as the prostitute Sera, especially when she has to carry the movie, when the story focuses on her because Ben has briefly disappeared. Their impossible love is so believable it's almost painful. The cinematography fits the depressing tone of the movie: almost everything takes place at night, in a city full of lights that don't comfort, or in dark and small rooms  particularly while Ben is suffering the consequences of abstinence, the rooms begin looking claustrophobic, as if there was less and less air with each second that passes. The director Mike Figgis also wrote the music and even played some of the instruments for the soundtrack: his jazz fits the Las Vegas atmosphere beautifully. All in all, you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie since it can easily make you cry, but it's totally worth your time. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters. Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other. The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession. Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, "You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness." So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what. I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this? Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again. On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction. Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.

    Directed by Mike Figgis, "Leaving Las Vegas" stars a scenery chewing Nicholas Cage as a jobless alcoholic whose wife and family have abandoned him. Depressed, and looking to commit suicide, Cage pumps his entire life's savings into one last Las Vegas trip. Here he will consume copious amounts of alcohol and then die. At least that's the plan. Much of the film watches as Cage strikes up an impromptu relationship with a local prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). They form a bond of understanding, mutual acceptance and perhaps unconditional love. Figgis then clashes many moments of romanticised self-pity with Las Vegan grime and sleaze. This is Neil Jordan, Abel Ferrara territory, the director trying to paint a darkly glamorous fairy tale against a sordid backdrop. It works, but this is still an overly sentimental, overly piteous tale, and none of Figgis' characters or relationships are psychological plausible. People don't behave quite this way, Shue plays the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold clich&eacute;, and Cage paradoxically plays a suicidal depressive who's charming and in love with life. It's all a giant writer's fantasy. Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was "asking for" rape. Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines  she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips  but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls. The film seems to use "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago". Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion.

If I could write a essay about couples bringing the best out of each other or helping each other I think I would create a pretty good essay with the help of this movie and Dexter! If you love movies that are sweet and are realistic in it's dramatic display you will just adore this movie and I recommend it to anyone! And also Mariska Hargitay the actress who plays Detective Olivia Benson from Law and Order: SVU is in this movie in a few short clips. One downfall about this movie I would have to say is The soundtrack was creepy at some parts and they repeated to many songs but movies can't be perfect.

    When speaking of Nicolas Cage, most people wouldn't define him as a good actor. Still, he has had some roles in great movies and he takes his job very seriously. That's probably one of the reasons why he won an Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas for best actor  he prepared for his role by binge drinking, visiting hospitalised alcoholics and filming himself drunk to study his speech patterns. Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced, broke alcoholic who just got fired because of his addiction. He decides to take all his money and move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One evening he meets a prostitute, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), and pays her to keep him company. After her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is killed, Ben moves in with Sera and they start a strange relationship, agreeing they won't try to change each other. Leaving Las Vegas is not a movie for everyone: it's a depressive story about two good people who realise they are doomed and there's no point in fighting for a change. Ben and Sera feel good when they are together, but Ben can't abandon his addiction, and Sera her job. It also features uneasy scenes of sex, alcoholism and chaos. The movie manages to remind us what a horrible and dangerous disease alcoholism is, mostly thanks to Cage's great performance. Shue is also great as the prostitute Sera, especially when she has to carry the movie, when the story focuses on her because Ben has briefly disappeared. Their impossible love is so believable it's almost painful. The cinematography fits the depressing tone of the movie: almost everything takes place at night, in a city full of lights that don't comfort, or in dark and small rooms  particularly while Ben is suffering the consequences of abstinence, the rooms begin looking claustrophobic, as if there was less and less air with each second that passes. The director Mike Figgis also wrote the music and even played some of the instruments for the soundtrack: his jazz fits the Las Vegas atmosphere beautifully. All in all, you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie since it can easily make you cry, but it's totally worth your time. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters. Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other. The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession. Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, "You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness." So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what. I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this? Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again. On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction. Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.

    Directed by Mike Figgis, "Leaving Las Vegas" stars a scenery chewing Nicholas Cage as a jobless alcoholic whose wife and family have abandoned him. Depressed, and looking to commit suicide, Cage pumps his entire life's savings into one last Las Vegas trip. Here he will consume copious amounts of alcohol and then die. At least that's the plan. Much of the film watches as Cage strikes up an impromptu relationship with a local prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). They form a bond of understanding, mutual acceptance and perhaps unconditional love. Figgis then clashes many moments of romanticised self-pity with Las Vegan grime and sleaze. This is Neil Jordan, Abel Ferrara territory, the director trying to paint a darkly glamorous fairy tale against a sordid backdrop. It works, but this is still an overly sentimental, overly piteous tale, and none of Figgis' characters or relationships are psychological plausible. People don't behave quite this way, Shue plays the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold clich&eacute;, and Cage paradoxically plays a suicidal depressive who's charming and in love with life. It's all a giant writer's fantasy. Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was "asking for" rape. Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines  she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips  but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls. The film seems to use "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago". Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion. The film was shot in Super-16. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. See "The Cooler" and "In a Lonely Place".

    Spoiler: An alcoholic (sacked) screenwriter and an abused prostitute find true love in Las Vegas. Except she gets gang raped and he dies. Apparently John O'Brien, the author of the novel, killed himself while the movie was in production. Mike Figgis may or may not have let him in to see the rushes. Oh God, it's Mike Figgis again. I caught this pile of tripe on a low-rent TV channel, and it occurred to me that the L'Oreal ads with over-lit, over-made-up, underdressed models were more realistic than this trite, shallow, exploitative pile of garbage. The Mike Figgis checklist: 1. Completely static character arcs? Check. 2. Characters behave idiotically in order to advance story? Check. 3. Characters suffering physical injury or abuse come back stronger than ever in a day or two? Check. If you want to hear Nicolas 'Oscar for doing retard' (alcoholic counts) Cage and Elisabeth Shue saying naughty words then Leaving Las Vegas is for you. If you have any discernment whatever is isn't.

    Leaving Las Vegas is a romantic drama film based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue, which forms the center of the film.It is written and directed by Mike Figgis. The film tells a story of a a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera, failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees.This charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness. Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, this multi- nuanced portrait of an alcoholic is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.As far as the acting is concerned, this uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story is sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.And most of all,it pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.

    Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?

    Don't get me wrong, this film is thoroughly downbeat, however I feel alcoholism is still slightly sugar coated. The likelihood of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) finding a woman as attractive and utterly devoted as Sera (Elizabeth Shue) is slim. It's possible of course, their bond is understandable; they're both people in grave need of care, one being a severe addict and the other being a victim on the fringe of society. Also, the crucial element that makes the relationship and indeed the film work is its platonicism. Nevertheless, I thought that 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a somewhat idealised account of dire alcoholism. This really struck me in an erotically charged scene in which the pair kiss and caress each other with the help of a large bottle of liquor - it's an image that would exist merely in the dreams of most addicts. However, the engaging central romance certainly beats 2 hours of a more ordinary dive into alcoholism, which would be a film of roughly two sets: a pub and a bedroom stained with urine, excrement, blood and vomit. A film of this nature depends on a good central performance, and it gets one. Cage is depressingly real and effective as Ben. I am a fan of many of Cage's unhinged roles, however 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one the films that proves that when he moderates his idiosyncratic lunacy, he can produce genuinely good, measured performances. The film is scored with smooth, melancholic Jazz tracks and the narrative is constructed by a tautly composed prologue which gives a brief insight into Ben's life before he left for Las Vegas. This includes a brilliant scene of Ben ridding himself of his personal and professional existence to the sound of Michael McDonald's energetic 'Lonely Teardrops'. It's a scene of mixed emotions, although he is condemning himself, it is also an act of liberation. Not much detail is given about his life in the prologue, however it is clear that he was a popular and successful family man. When he is fired, his boss says with a touching sincerity 'we enjoyed having you around here, but you know how it is', giving him a cheque which Ben describes as 'too generous'. This depth given to Cage's character makes his decline all the more tragic. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is dark, seedy and tragic. Recommended. www.hawkensian.com

    A good, daring and courageous film. I have to say I have hardly ever seen such an "open" American film, so very non-Hollywoodlike. Exemplifying the film's bluntness is a phrase by Shue: "The only thing waiting for me when I get back home is mouth wash, to wash away the taste of sperm". It's a pity really, this could have been a groundbreaking, excellent film if the screenplay had paid a little more attention to the why's and how's, and tried to be a little more realistic about the quantity Cage drinks, which is unreasonable. It also goes a little "over the top" in some scenes which was not necessary. Otherwise, great performances by both lead actors, very deserving of the Oscar awarded to Nicholas Cage.

The film was shot in Super-16. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. See "The Cooler" and "In a Lonely Place".

    Spoiler: An alcoholic (sacked) screenwriter and an abused prostitute find true love in Las Vegas. Except she gets gang raped and he dies. Apparently John O'Brien, the author of the novel, killed himself while the movie was in production. Mike Figgis may or may not have let him in to see the rushes. Oh God, it's Mike Figgis again. I caught this pile of tripe on a low-rent TV channel, and it occurred to me that the L'Oreal ads with over-lit, over-made-up, underdressed models were more realistic than this trite, shallow, exploitative pile of garbage. The Mike Figgis checklist: 1. Completely static character arcs? Check. 2. Characters behave idiotically in order to advance story? Check. 3. Characters suffering physical injury or abuse come back stronger than ever in a day or two? Check. If you want to hear Nicolas 'Oscar for doing retard' (alcoholic counts) Cage and Elisabeth Shue saying naughty words then Leaving Las Vegas is for you. If you have any discernment whatever is isn't.

    Leaving Las Vegas is a romantic drama film based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue, which forms the center of the film.It is written and directed by Mike Figgis. The film tells a story of a a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera, failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees.This charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness. Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, this multi- nuanced portrait of an alcoholic is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.As far as the acting is concerned, this uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story is sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.And most of all,it pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.

    Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?

    Don't get me wrong, this film is thoroughly downbeat, however I feel alcoholism is still slightly sugar coated. The likelihood of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) finding a woman as attractive and utterly devoted as Sera (Elizabeth Shue) is slim. It's possible of course, their bond is understandable; they're both people in grave need of care, one being a severe addict and the other being a victim on the fringe of society. Also, the crucial element that makes the relationship and indeed the film work is its platonicism. Nevertheless, I thought that 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a somewhat idealised account of dire alcoholism. This really struck me in an erotically charged scene in which the pair kiss and caress each other with the help of a large bottle of liquor - it's an image that would exist merely in the dreams of most addicts. However, the engaging central romance certainly beats 2 hours of a more ordinary dive into alcoholism, which would be a film of roughly two sets: a pub and a bedroom stained with urine, excrement, blood and vomit. A film of this nature depends on a good central performance, and it gets one. Cage is depressingly real and effective as Ben. I am a fan of many of Cage's unhinged roles, however 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one the films that proves that when he moderates his idiosyncratic lunacy, he can produce genuinely good, measured performances. The film is scored with smooth, melancholic Jazz tracks and the narrative is constructed by a tautly composed prologue which gives a brief insight into Ben's life before he left for Las Vegas. This includes a brilliant scene of Ben ridding himself of his personal and professional existence to the sound of Michael McDonald's energetic 'Lonely Teardrops'. It's a scene of mixed emotions, although he is condemning himself, it is also an act of liberation. Not much detail is given about his life in the prologue, however it is clear that he was a popular and successful family man. When he is fired, his boss says with a touching sincerity 'we enjoyed having you around here, but you know how it is', giving him a cheque which Ben describes as 'too generous'. This depth given to Cage's character makes his decline all the more tragic. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is dark, seedy and tragic. Recommended. www.hawkensian.com

    A good, daring and courageous film. I have to say I have hardly ever seen such an "open" American film, so very non-Hollywoodlike. Exemplifying the film's bluntness is a phrase by Shue: "The only thing waiting for me when I get back home is mouth wash, to wash away the taste of sperm". It's a pity really, this could have been a groundbreaking, excellent film if the screenplay had paid a little more attention to the why's and how's, and tried to be a little more realistic about the quantity Cage drinks, which is unreasonable. It also goes a little "over the top" in some scenes which was not necessary. Otherwise, great performances by both lead actors, very deserving of the Oscar awarded to Nicholas Cage.

    The first thought that came across my head when I started watching this movie was " These two remind me of Dexter and Hannah!" For all you Dexter buffs out their then you know how Hannah brings out the best in Dexter and his situation while Dexter does the same. If I could write a essay about couples bringing the best out of each other or helping each other I think I would create a pretty good essay with the help of this movie and Dexter! If you love movies that are sweet and are realistic in it's dramatic display you will just adore this movie and I recommend it to anyone! And also Mariska Hargitay the actress who plays Detective Olivia Benson from Law and Order: SVU is in this movie in a few short clips. One downfall about this movie I would have to say is The soundtrack was creepy at some parts and they repeated to many songs but movies can't be perfect.

    When speaking of Nicolas Cage, most people wouldn't define him as a good actor. Still, he has had some roles in great movies and he takes his job very seriously. That's probably one of the reasons why he won an Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas for best actor  he prepared for his role by binge drinking, visiting hospitalised alcoholics and filming himself drunk to study his speech patterns. Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced, broke alcoholic who just got fired because of his addiction. He decides to take all his money and move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One evening he meets a prostitute, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), and pays her to keep him company. After her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is killed, Ben moves in with Sera and they start a strange relationship, agreeing they won't try to change each other. Leaving Las Vegas is not a movie for everyone: it's a depressive story about two good people who realise they are doomed and there's no point in fighting for a change. Ben and Sera feel good when they are together, but Ben can't abandon his addiction, and Sera her job. It also features uneasy scenes of sex, alcoholism and chaos. The movie manages to remind us what a horrible and dangerous disease alcoholism is, mostly thanks to Cage's great performance. Shue is also great as the prostitute Sera, especially when she has to carry the movie, when the story focuses on her because Ben has briefly disappeared. Their impossible love is so believable it's almost painful. The cinematography fits the depressing tone of the movie: almost everything takes place at night, in a city full of lights that don't comfort, or in dark and small rooms  particularly while Ben is suffering the consequences of abstinence, the rooms begin looking claustrophobic, as if there was less and less air with each second that passes. The director Mike Figgis also wrote the music and even played some of the instruments for the soundtrack: his jazz fits the Las Vegas atmosphere beautifully. All in all, you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie since it can easily make you cry, but it's totally worth your time. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters. Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other. The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession. Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, "You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness." So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what. I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this? Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again. On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction. Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.

    Directed by Mike Figgis, "Leaving Las Vegas" stars a scenery chewing Nicholas Cage as a jobless alcoholic whose wife and family have abandoned him. Depressed, and looking to commit suicide, Cage pumps his entire life's savings into one last Las Vegas trip. Here he will consume copious amounts of alcohol and then die. At least that's the plan. Much of the film watches as Cage strikes up an impromptu relationship with a local prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). They form a bond of understanding, mutual acceptance and perhaps unconditional love. Figgis then clashes many moments of romanticised self-pity with Las Vegan grime and sleaze. This is Neil Jordan, Abel Ferrara territory, the director trying to paint a darkly glamorous fairy tale against a sordid backdrop. It works, but this is still an overly sentimental, overly piteous tale, and none of Figgis' characters or relationships are psychological plausible. People don't behave quite this way, Shue plays the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold clich&eacute;, and Cage paradoxically plays a suicidal depressive who's charming and in love with life. It's all a giant writer's fantasy. Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was "asking for" rape. Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines  she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips  but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls. The film seems to use "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago". Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion. The film was shot in Super-16. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. See "The Cooler" and "In a Lonely Place".

Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced, broke alcoholic who just got fired because of his addiction. He decides to take all his money and move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One evening he meets a prostitute, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), and pays her to keep him company. After her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is killed, Ben moves in with Sera and they start a strange relationship, agreeing they won't try to change each other. Leaving Las Vegas is not a movie for everyone: it's a depressive story about two good people who realise they are doomed and there's no point in fighting for a change. Ben and Sera feel good when they are together, but Ben can't abandon his addiction, and Sera her job. It also features uneasy scenes of sex, alcoholism and chaos. The movie manages to remind us what a horrible and dangerous disease alcoholism is, mostly thanks to Cage's great performance. Shue is also great as the prostitute Sera, especially when she has to carry the movie, when the story focuses on her because Ben has briefly disappeared. Their impossible love is so believable it's almost painful. The cinematography fits the depressing tone of the movie: almost everything takes place at night, in a city full of lights that don't comfort, or in dark and small rooms  particularly while Ben is suffering the consequences of abstinence, the rooms begin looking claustrophobic, as if there was less and less air with each second that passes. The director Mike Figgis also wrote the music and even played some of the instruments for the soundtrack: his jazz fits the Las Vegas atmosphere beautifully. All in all, you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie since it can easily make you cry, but it's totally worth your time. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters. Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other. The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession. Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, "You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness." So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what. I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this? Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again. On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction. Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.

    Directed by Mike Figgis, "Leaving Las Vegas" stars a scenery chewing Nicholas Cage as a jobless alcoholic whose wife and family have abandoned him. Depressed, and looking to commit suicide, Cage pumps his entire life's savings into one last Las Vegas trip. Here he will consume copious amounts of alcohol and then die. At least that's the plan. Much of the film watches as Cage strikes up an impromptu relationship with a local prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). They form a bond of understanding, mutual acceptance and perhaps unconditional love. Figgis then clashes many moments of romanticised self-pity with Las Vegan grime and sleaze. This is Neil Jordan, Abel Ferrara territory, the director trying to paint a darkly glamorous fairy tale against a sordid backdrop. It works, but this is still an overly sentimental, overly piteous tale, and none of Figgis' characters or relationships are psychological plausible. People don't behave quite this way, Shue plays the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold clich&eacute;, and Cage paradoxically plays a suicidal depressive who's charming and in love with life. It's all a giant writer's fantasy. Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was "asking for" rape. Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines  she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips  but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls. The film seems to use "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago". Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion. The film was shot in Super-16. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. See "The Cooler" and "In a Lonely Place".

    Spoiler: An alcoholic (sacked) screenwriter and an abused prostitute find true love in Las Vegas. Except she gets gang raped and he dies. Apparently John O'Brien, the author of the novel, killed himself while the movie was in production. Mike Figgis may or may not have let him in to see the rushes. Oh God, it's Mike Figgis again. I caught this pile of tripe on a low-rent TV channel, and it occurred to me that the L'Oreal ads with over-lit, over-made-up, underdressed models were more realistic than this trite, shallow, exploitative pile of garbage. The Mike Figgis checklist: 1. Completely static character arcs? Check. 2. Characters behave idiotically in order to advance story? Check. 3. Characters suffering physical injury or abuse come back stronger than ever in a day or two? Check. If you want to hear Nicolas 'Oscar for doing retard' (alcoholic counts) Cage and Elisabeth Shue saying naughty words then Leaving Las Vegas is for you. If you have any discernment whatever is isn't.

    Leaving Las Vegas is a romantic drama film based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue, which forms the center of the film.It is written and directed by Mike Figgis. The film tells a story of a a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera, failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees.This charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness. Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, this multi- nuanced portrait of an alcoholic is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.As far as the acting is concerned, this uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story is sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.And most of all,it pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.

    Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?

    A somewhat idealised account of alcoholism, but still a thoroughly downbeat one

    Don't get me wrong, this film is thoroughly downbeat, however I feel alcoholism is still slightly sugar coated. The likelihood of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) finding a woman as attractive and utterly devoted as Sera (Elizabeth Shue) is slim. It's possible of course, their bond is understandable; they're both people in grave need of care, one being a severe addict and the other being a victim on the fringe of society. Also, the crucial element that makes the relationship and indeed the film work is its platonicism. Nevertheless, I thought that 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a somewhat idealised account of dire alcoholism. This really struck me in an erotically charged scene in which the pair kiss and caress each other with the help of a large bottle of liquor - it's an image that would exist merely in the dreams of most addicts. However, the engaging central romance certainly beats 2 hours of a more ordinary dive into alcoholism, which would be a film of roughly two sets: a pub and a bedroom stained with urine, excrement, blood and vomit. A film of this nature depends on a good central performance, and it gets one. Cage is depressingly real and effective as Ben. I am a fan of many of Cage's unhinged roles, however 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one the films that proves that when he moderates his idiosyncratic lunacy, he can produce genuinely good, measured performances. The film is scored with smooth, melancholic Jazz tracks and the narrative is constructed by a tautly composed prologue which gives a brief insight into Ben's life before he left for Las Vegas. This includes a brilliant scene of Ben ridding himself of his personal and professional existence to the sound of Michael McDonald's energetic 'Lonely Teardrops'. It's a scene of mixed emotions, although he is condemning himself, it is also an act of liberation. Not much detail is given about his life in the prologue, however it is clear that he was a popular and successful family man. When he is fired, his boss says with a touching sincerity 'we enjoyed having you around here, but you know how it is', giving him a cheque which Ben describes as 'too generous'. This depth given to Cage's character makes his decline all the more tragic. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is dark, seedy and tragic. Recommended. www.hawkensian.com

    A good, daring and courageous film. I have to say I have hardly ever seen such an "open" American film, so very non-Hollywoodlike. Exemplifying the film's bluntness is a phrase by Shue: "The only thing waiting for me when I get back home is mouth wash, to wash away the taste of sperm". It's a pity really, this could have been a groundbreaking, excellent film if the screenplay had paid a little more attention to the why's and how's, and tried to be a little more realistic about the quantity Cage drinks, which is unreasonable. It also goes a little "over the top" in some scenes which was not necessary. Otherwise, great performances by both lead actors, very deserving of the Oscar awarded to Nicholas Cage.
