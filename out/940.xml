    Three band members hoping for a big break head to a radio station to play their demo tape and wind up holding everyone hostage with plastic guns when the head DJ is unable to play them. To say this film is a good one from a critical standpoint is a lie, as it is pretty bad in a multitude of ways. But as far as 1990s comedies go, or films connected to "Saturday Night Live" (this one very loosely), this ranks up there in entertainment value. If nothing else, the cast sells this -- David Arquette and Michael Richards before their prime. Adam Sandler at his peak. Brendan Fraser in a transition from Pauly Shore to "real" films... and Steve Buscemi? This is just loaded with talent. The music will not appeal to everyone. Even as a fan of metal, I have to say a lot of the music is not as top-notch as it probably should be.

    I saw this flick in the theaters way back (1994). I'm a band guy, not professionally, but it eats up a lot of my time as a hobby and every so often I like to revisit some movies having to do with music. On a positive note, I still love the music and the amount of rocker cameos and a huge cast of "Oh HEY...isn't that...?" to be found in Airheads. But on a second viewing via Netflix, the negatives kind of balance out the positives and I give this movie a solid 5. The story left me frustrated and the comedy was eh. This movie could have been so much more. It could have been a classic, instead...it's kinda embarrassing. Stick to swinging in the trees Brendon.

    When i first saw this on Movieplex one Sunday morning, i couldn't turn away from the TV. it was nonstop hilarious. i think this is Brenden Faser's best film. i loved this movie because it stars three comedic guys and its in the 90s and i love 90s movies. after watching this film, it made me wanna go out and start a band. every time i see Steve Buechemi, he is funny but in this movie, he really stands out. i love this movie so much that i'm gonna watch it again! i just cannot express how funny this movie is so you'll have to check it out for yourself. i am so glad that i found this movie because if i didn't, i'd really be missing out on a classic 1994 film.

    All I can say is that a movie which stars Brendon Fraser, Steve Buschemi, and Adam Sandler must be good. Actually, when I first saw this movie, I did not know who any of the above were, I just thought that the adds in the cinema looked cool, hired the video, loved it, and finally ended up buying it. Last night when we watched it, we discussed about what memorable nineties comedies were. We concluded that Empire Records, Airheads, and Clueless would leave something very memorable. As for British Comedies, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. I need not say any more. Anyway, Airheads is about three guys who have written what they considered to be a really cool song, but none of the record companies want to hear it. So they try to get it played on the air after breaking into the radio station KBBL Rebel Radio. After an initial refusal, out come some very real looking water pistols. This movie, though seeming very shallow, is actually quite deep. The major theme in this movie is that music is not what we like, but what the record companies want to sell. This is clearly seen when they are in a nightclub watching a band called the Son's of Thunder, whom lost to their band, the Lone Rangers, at a battle of the bands, yet the Son's of Thunder received the contract. Just because music is good does not mean that the record companies are going to sell it. This movie is in fact very scathing of the record industry, and the entertainment industry in particular. They do not want to know this band until they hold up the radio station and gain so much publicity that they can see a lot of money. As such they snatch up the band in an instant, and try to get a contract signed before anybody else does. They are not interested in the song, they simply want the money that their publicity will bring. Chez is completely the opposite. He wants to do it for the music, and the lifestyle. Even though he wants the money, it is the music that's important, and what is more important is that they show their fans that they can play this music and it is not some lame act buy people that are loved playing a song that an unknown wrote. This is seen when Chez uses the contract as toilet paper after learning that it was written up without hearing the song. The other interesting part of this show is the scene where Chez's past is revealed. The SWAT officer tries to turn his popularity against him by revealing that he was a school nerd who played dungeons and dragons. The great thing about this scene is that after mulling over it for a bit, others began to own up to these secret desires, showing that it is not a thing that nerds simply do, and if you have done the things then who really cares anyway. What these guys want is somebody who is real, not some plastered statue created by the record companies to simply sell records. I love this movie. The humor is witty, but it goes beyond simple comedy to really bring out what the essence of music is. Music is what you enjoy, not something to make money. There are so many instances in this movie where this is brought out. Another scene is where Chez is going through the CDs and realises that most of them are not played because the radio station does not want to play them. In this movie we see the struggle between doing something for money and doing something for the love of it. Chez does this because he loves it while the station manager wants the money. If the owners tell him to change, he isn't going to argue because he wants the money and does not care about the music. We see that doing something simply for love in the ends wins people over, because not only do a whole heap of people rock up at the radio station to cheer them on, but people in the radio station take their side as well.

    Heavy metal trio The Lone Rangers haven't had much luck getting their songs heard. During their last desperate trip to a radio station they bring along some genuine looking water pistols and spontaneously pull them out when they're turned down again. One of the workers at the station escapes being taken hostage and calls the police, and a long standoff ensues until the Rangers can play their tape, which the lead singer gave to his now ex-girlfriend... Airheads is one of those films you either love or hate. When this movie first came out, I thought it was great and very funny. Nearly twenty years later, it's still funny, but for different reasons. Mantegna is the best thing in this movie, followed by Buscemi. Fraser is Fraser, and you can tell Sandler is just in waiting, and his star deservedly shone two years later. But the thing that makes this film work isn't the situation, nor the three leads, it's the randomness of it all. One minute, Egon and Winson from ghostbusters are there, next we see Lemmy! totally ridiculous, but it works, just.

    The Lone Rangers (all 3 of them) are hard up to get a record deal, they try everything. After the lead singer/guitarist gets kicked out of his girlfriends apt. he knows he must make it happen. The three of them burst into a radio station begging for their demo to be played. When their demands aren't met they hold the station up with fake guns and go on air and get all the rockers in the city involved. The band learns many lessons, the DJ learns of how dirty his boss is, and the cops learn they have their work cut out for them on this wild rock and roll hostage comedy. This movie came out in 94 when things like Waynes World was still in everyones mind. Rock and Roll was still breathing and hair metal had all but died, but MTV was still playing videos and keeping it popular enough for this movie to work. I have seen this a few times and it never did much for me, it has some okay music including Motorhead and White Zombie, but it also has a lot of crappy music that is now very dated. It isn't very funny, but it's worth a watch. Brendon Frasure did okay in his early movies and I can say that here too. Steve Buscemi is always great, but he seemed much more vibrant and youthful here, which was a different side of him as he usually plays a boring serious sarcastic character. Adam Sandler was at the height of his SNL stardom and he is a horrible actor, always has been. Other great performances can be seen by people like Ernie Hudson as a cop, Harold Ramis, Ernies Ghostbuster partner can be seen here in a small role, Chris Farley playing the silly fat guy as he done so well, Michael McKean as a yuppie radio station owner, Joe Mantegna as a long haired DJ, David Arquette also as a crazy surfer dude working at the station and Michael Richards playing a crazy employee of the station who spends the entire movie hiding in the air ducts. Judd Nelson plays an uptight record studio president, the same company name used in Waynes World. Lemmy from Motorhead has a cameo here and white zombie play live in a bar, even MTV'S dinosaur VJ Kurt Loder makes a cameo. My problem with it was that it just wasn't rock and roll enough for me. Why does the fender on Brendans motorcycle say "fag"? Also I hated that Beavis and Butthead called in at the radio station, that was stupid... 4/10 stars, worth a watch, but nothing great...not a true rock and roll movie.

    Airheads entertainingly tells an amiable story which captures the attention and interest throughout its running time. Wholly improbable, this doesn't matter - one enjoys the company of most of the characters, and one is (as intended) annoyed by the duplicitous station manager and the idiotic gung-go SWAT chief. It isn't actually that funny, mind you, but it's still entertaining. And it's notable for early appearances by a fair number of people in the early stages of their careers before they became major successes. Each of them plays somewhat contrary to the types they have subsequently become known for, and each shows signs of the stars they are to become. Steve Buscemi must get the nod for favourite performance, though.

    The Lone Rangers, an unsigned, self-proclaimed "power slop" band, consisting of guitarist Chazz Darby (Fraser), bassist Rex (Buscemi) and drummer Pip (Sandler), takes over a radio station so they can get their demo played on the air, and hopefully get a record contract. The whole thing goes spiraling downhill when their demo is destroyed, and while trying to escape, the boys come to realize that the radio station has become surrounded by the police. The Lone Rangers take the radio station and it's staff hostage with water guns that look like Uzis (filled with hot sauce) and with all their might try to get their demo to get some airplay as a crowd of soon-to-be fans gathers at the station to follow the mayhem. Now, the only reason I wanted to watch 'Airheads' in the first place was because I saw on the TV section of the newspapers that the wonderful Steve Buscemi would be starring in it. I was certainly not expecting it to be as funny as it turned out to be. I've never been a huge fan of Brendan Fraser and I still have a strong dislike for Adam Sandler, but this trio came together in 'Airheads' and created something so funny I laugh out loud whenever I think about some if it's moments, which does earn me the occasional glance in a public bus. Being a big fan of heavy metal myself, I was happily surprised to see White Zombie AND Lemmy himself in cameos, and the movie delivered some hilarious and original dialogue. As with every movie, it does have it's flaws; some of the jokes just don't deliver, and the character of the man hiding in the air ducts was, in my opinion, a bit too dramatic and silly. The big finale on the rooftop of the KPPX building was also a bit too weird for my taste. If you're looking for a simple and funny movie to rock your world, 'Airheads' is the one to go for!

    I just got this movie and I really like this film. I was not expecting this to be much, but as usual, I am wrong. This film is about three guys who are in a band and nobody listens to their music. They decide to break in a radio station and take over the place and people as hostages. The acting is excellent and the chemistry is great. Sandler and Buscemi are hilarious. They are the best part of the film. The script and the basic plot line worked well together. I liked the music for the film. I am not a big fan of this kind of music, but somehow Sandler and the gang just made the music work. I recommend this movie for everybody. I rate this film a 9/10.

    Adam Sandler, Brendon Frazer and Steve Buscemi star in this hilarious comedy that proves that movies that take risks pay off. The film is about 3 not so smart striving rock stars who after they get blown off on a radio show with an obnoxious boss and stuck up radio leader. Well from then they end up holding up the place and there leads to an hilarious movie. This movie is a very funny one Adam Sandler did very well in not to say the other 2 main character did not as even the cameos and co stars did a good job in this film. Overall the movie is extremely funny and I think is the funniest Adam Sandler movie that he does not star outrightly in. I rate this movie a fair 73% for keeping me laughing the whole way

I've never been a huge fan of Brendan Fraser and I still have a strong dislike for Adam Sandler, but this trio came together in 'Airheads' and created something so funny I laugh out loud whenever I think about some if it's moments, which does earn me the occasional glance in a public bus. Being a big fan of heavy metal myself, I was happily surprised to see White Zombie AND Lemmy himself in cameos, and the movie delivered some hilarious and original dialogue. As with every movie, it does have it's flaws; some of the jokes just don't deliver, and the character of the man hiding in the air ducts was, in my opinion, a bit too dramatic and silly. The big finale on the rooftop of the KPPX building was also a bit too weird for my taste. If you're looking for a simple and funny movie to rock your world, 'Airheads' is the one to go for!

    I just got this movie and I really like this film. I was not expecting this to be much, but as usual, I am wrong. This film is about three guys who are in a band and nobody listens to their music. They decide to break in a radio station and take over the place and people as hostages. The acting is excellent and the chemistry is great. Sandler and Buscemi are hilarious. They are the best part of the film. The script and the basic plot line worked well together. I liked the music for the film. I am not a big fan of this kind of music, but somehow Sandler and the gang just made the music work. I recommend this movie for everybody. I rate this film a 9/10.

    Adam Sandler, Brendon Frazer and Steve Buscemi star in this hilarious comedy that proves that movies that take risks pay off. The film is about 3 not so smart striving rock stars who after they get blown off on a radio show with an obnoxious boss and stuck up radio leader. Well from then they end up holding up the place and there leads to an hilarious movie. This movie is a very funny one Adam Sandler did very well in not to say the other 2 main character did not as even the cameos and co stars did a good job in this film. Overall the movie is extremely funny and I think is the funniest Adam Sandler movie that he does not star outrightly in. I rate this movie a fair 73% for keeping me laughing the whole way

    Three band members hoping for a big break head to a radio station to play their demo tape and wind up holding everyone hostage with plastic guns when the head DJ is unable to play them. To say this film is a good one from a critical standpoint is a lie, as it is pretty bad in a multitude of ways. But as far as 1990s comedies go, or films connected to "Saturday Night Live" (this one very loosely), this ranks up there in entertainment value. If nothing else, the cast sells this -- David Arquette and Michael Richards before their prime. Adam Sandler at his peak. Brendan Fraser in a transition from Pauly Shore to "real" films... and Steve Buscemi? This is just loaded with talent. The music will not appeal to everyone. Even as a fan of metal, I have to say a lot of the music is not as top-notch as it probably should be.

    I saw this flick in the theaters way back (1994). I'm a band guy, not professionally, but it eats up a lot of my time as a hobby and every so often I like to revisit some movies having to do with music. On a positive note, I still love the music and the amount of rocker cameos and a huge cast of "Oh HEY...isn't that...?" to be found in Airheads. But on a second viewing via Netflix, the negatives kind of balance out the positives and I give this movie a solid 5. The story left me frustrated and the comedy was eh. This movie could have been so much more. It could have been a classic, instead...it's kinda embarrassing. Stick to swinging in the trees Brendon.

    When i first saw this on Movieplex one Sunday morning, i couldn't turn away from the TV. it was nonstop hilarious. i think this is Brenden Faser's best film. i loved this movie because it stars three comedic guys and its in the 90s and i love 90s movies. after watching this film, it made me wanna go out and start a band. every time i see Steve Buechemi, he is funny but in this movie, he really stands out. i love this movie so much that i'm gonna watch it again! i just cannot express how funny this movie is so you'll have to check it out for yourself. i am so glad that i found this movie because if i didn't, i'd really be missing out on a classic 1994 film.

    All I can say is that a movie which stars Brendon Fraser, Steve Buschemi, and Adam Sandler must be good. Actually, when I first saw this movie, I did not know who any of the above were, I just thought that the adds in the cinema looked cool, hired the video, loved it, and finally ended up buying it. Last night when we watched it, we discussed about what memorable nineties comedies were. We concluded that Empire Records, Airheads, and Clueless would leave something very memorable. As for British Comedies, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. I need not say any more. Anyway, Airheads is about three guys who have written what they considered to be a really cool song, but none of the record companies want to hear it. So they try to get it played on the air after breaking into the radio station KBBL Rebel Radio. After an initial refusal, out come some very real looking water pistols. This movie, though seeming very shallow, is actually quite deep. The major theme in this movie is that music is not what we like, but what the record companies want to sell. This is clearly seen when they are in a nightclub watching a band called the Son's of Thunder, whom lost to their band, the Lone Rangers, at a battle of the bands, yet the Son's of Thunder received the contract. Just because music is good does not mean that the record companies are going to sell it. This movie is in fact very scathing of the record industry, and the entertainment industry in particular. They do not want to know this band until they hold up the radio station and gain so much publicity that they can see a lot of money. As such they snatch up the band in an instant, and try to get a contract signed before anybody else does. They are not interested in the song, they simply want the money that their publicity will bring. Chez is completely the opposite. He wants to do it for the music, and the lifestyle. Even though he wants the money, it is the music that's important, and what is more important is that they show their fans that they can play this music and it is not some lame act buy people that are loved playing a song that an unknown wrote. This is seen when Chez uses the contract as toilet paper after learning that it was written up without hearing the song. The other interesting part of this show is the scene where Chez's past is revealed. The SWAT officer tries to turn his popularity against him by revealing that he was a school nerd who played dungeons and dragons. The great thing about this scene is that after mulling over it for a bit, others began to own up to these secret desires, showing that it is not a thing that nerds simply do, and if you have done the things then who really cares anyway. What these guys want is somebody who is real, not some plastered statue created by the record companies to simply sell records. I love this movie. The humor is witty, but it goes beyond simple comedy to really bring out what the essence of music is. Music is what you enjoy, not something to make money. There are so many instances in this movie where this is brought out. Another scene is where Chez is going through the CDs and realises that most of them are not played because the radio station does not want to play them. In this movie we see the struggle between doing something for money and doing something for the love of it. Chez does this because he loves it while the station manager wants the money. If the owners tell him to change, he isn't going to argue because he wants the money and does not care about the music. We see that doing something simply for love in the ends wins people over, because not only do a whole heap of people rock up at the radio station to cheer them on, but people in the radio station take their side as well.

    Heavy metal trio The Lone Rangers haven't had much luck getting their songs heard. During their last desperate trip to a radio station they bring along some genuine looking water pistols and spontaneously pull them out when they're turned down again. One of the workers at the station escapes being taken hostage and calls the police, and a long standoff ensues until the Rangers can play their tape, which the lead singer gave to his now ex-girlfriend... Airheads is one of those films you either love or hate. When this movie first came out, I thought it was great and very funny. Nearly twenty years later, it's still funny, but for different reasons. Mantegna is the best thing in this movie, followed by Buscemi. Fraser is Fraser, and you can tell Sandler is just in waiting, and his star deservedly shone two years later. But the thing that makes this film work isn't the situation, nor the three leads, it's the randomness of it all. One minute, Egon and Winson from ghostbusters are there, next we see Lemmy! totally ridiculous, but it works, just.

    The Lone Rangers (all 3 of them) are hard up to get a record deal, they try everything. After the lead singer/guitarist gets kicked out of his girlfriends apt. he knows he must make it happen. The three of them burst into a radio station begging for their demo to be played. When their demands aren't met they hold the station up with fake guns and go on air and get all the rockers in the city involved. The band learns many lessons, the DJ learns of how dirty his boss is, and the cops learn they have their work cut out for them on this wild rock and roll hostage comedy. This movie came out in 94 when things like Waynes World was still in everyones mind. Rock and Roll was still breathing and hair metal had all but died, but MTV was still playing videos and keeping it popular enough for this movie to work. I have seen this a few times and it never did much for me, it has some okay music including Motorhead and White Zombie, but it also has a lot of crappy music that is now very dated. It isn't very funny, but it's worth a watch. Brendon Frasure did okay in his early movies and I can say that here too. Steve Buscemi is always great, but he seemed much more vibrant and youthful here, which was a different side of him as he usually plays a boring serious sarcastic character. Adam Sandler was at the height of his SNL stardom and he is a horrible actor, always has been. Other great performances can be seen by people like Ernie Hudson as a cop, Harold Ramis, Ernies Ghostbuster partner can be seen here in a small role, Chris Farley playing the silly fat guy as he done so well, Michael McKean as a yuppie radio station owner, Joe Mantegna as a long haired DJ, David Arquette also as a crazy surfer dude working at the station and Michael Richards playing a crazy employee of the station who spends the entire movie hiding in the air ducts. Judd Nelson plays an uptight record studio president, the same company name used in Waynes World. Lemmy from Motorhead has a cameo here and white zombie play live in a bar, even MTV'S dinosaur VJ Kurt Loder makes a cameo. My problem with it was that it just wasn't rock and roll enough for me. Why does the fender on Brendans motorcycle say "fag"? Also I hated that Beavis and Butthead called in at the radio station, that was stupid... 4/10 stars, worth a watch, but nothing great...not a true rock and roll movie.

    Airheads entertainingly tells an amiable story which captures the attention and interest throughout its running time. Wholly improbable, this doesn't matter - one enjoys the company of most of the characters, and one is (as intended) annoyed by the duplicitous station manager and the idiotic gung-go SWAT chief. It isn't actually that funny, mind you, but it's still entertaining. And it's notable for early appearances by a fair number of people in the early stages of their careers before they became major successes. Each of them plays somewhat contrary to the types they have subsequently become known for, and each shows signs of the stars they are to become. Steve Buscemi must get the nod for favourite performance, though.

    The Lone Rangers, an unsigned, self-proclaimed "power slop" band, consisting of guitarist Chazz Darby (Fraser), bassist Rex (Buscemi) and drummer Pip (Sandler), takes over a radio station so they can get their demo played on the air, and hopefully get a record contract. The whole thing goes spiraling downhill when their demo is destroyed, and while trying to escape, the boys come to realize that the radio station has become surrounded by the police. The Lone Rangers take the radio station and it's staff hostage with water guns that look like Uzis (filled with hot sauce) and with all their might try to get their demo to get some airplay as a crowd of soon-to-be fans gathers at the station to follow the mayhem. Now, the only reason I wanted to watch 'Airheads' in the first place was because I saw on the TV section of the newspapers that the wonderful Steve Buscemi would be starring in it. I was certainly not expecting it to be as funny as it turned out to be.

    The Lone Rangers, an unsigned, self-proclaimed "power slop" band, consisting of guitarist Chazz Darby (Fraser), bassist Rex (Buscemi) and drummer Pip (Sandler), takes over a radio station so they can get their demo played on the air, and hopefully get a record contract. The whole thing goes spiraling downhill when their demo is destroyed, and while trying to escape, the boys come to realize that the radio station has become surrounded by the police. The Lone Rangers take the radio station and it's staff hostage with water guns that look like Uzis (filled with hot sauce) and with all their might try to get their demo to get some airplay as a crowd of soon-to-be fans gathers at the station to follow the mayhem. Now, the only reason I wanted to watch 'Airheads' in the first place was because I saw on the TV section of the newspapers that the wonderful Steve Buscemi would be starring in it. I was certainly not expecting it to be as funny as it turned out to be. I've never been a huge fan of Brendan Fraser and I still have a strong dislike for Adam Sandler, but this trio came together in 'Airheads' and created something so funny I laugh out loud whenever I think about some if it's moments, which does earn me the occasional glance in a public bus. Being a big fan of heavy metal myself, I was happily surprised to see White Zombie AND Lemmy himself in cameos, and the movie delivered some hilarious and original dialogue. As with every movie, it does have it's flaws; some of the jokes just don't deliver, and the character of the man hiding in the air ducts was, in my opinion, a bit too dramatic and silly. The big finale on the rooftop of the KPPX building was also a bit too weird for my taste. If you're looking for a simple and funny movie to rock your world, 'Airheads' is the one to go for!

    I just got this movie and I really like this film. I was not expecting this to be much, but as usual, I am wrong. This film is about three guys who are in a band and nobody listens to their music. They decide to break in a radio station and take over the place and people as hostages. The acting is excellent and the chemistry is great. Sandler and Buscemi are hilarious. They are the best part of the film. The script and the basic plot line worked well together. I liked the music for the film. I am not a big fan of this kind of music, but somehow Sandler and the gang just made the music work. I recommend this movie for everybody. I rate this film a 9/10.

    Adam Sandler, Brendon Frazer and Steve Buscemi star in this hilarious comedy that proves that movies that take risks pay off. The film is about 3 not so smart striving rock stars who after they get blown off on a radio show with an obnoxious boss and stuck up radio leader. Well from then they end up holding up the place and there leads to an hilarious movie. This movie is a very funny one Adam Sandler did very well in not to say the other 2 main character did not as even the cameos and co stars did a good job in this film. Overall the movie is extremely funny and I think is the funniest Adam Sandler movie that he does not star outrightly in. I rate this movie a fair 73% for keeping me laughing the whole way

    Three band members hoping for a big break head to a radio station to play their demo tape and wind up holding everyone hostage with plastic guns when the head DJ is unable to play them. To say this film is a good one from a critical standpoint is a lie, as it is pretty bad in a multitude of ways. But as far as 1990s comedies go, or films connected to "Saturday Night Live" (this one very loosely), this ranks up there in entertainment value. If nothing else, the cast sells this -- David Arquette and Michael Richards before their prime. Adam Sandler at his peak. Brendan Fraser in a transition from Pauly Shore to "real" films... and Steve Buscemi? This is just loaded with talent. The music will not appeal to everyone. Even as a fan of metal, I have to say a lot of the music is not as top-notch as it probably should be.

    I saw this flick in the theaters way back (1994). I'm a band guy, not professionally, but it eats up a lot of my time as a hobby and every so often I like to revisit some movies having to do with music. On a positive note, I still love the music and the amount of rocker cameos and a huge cast of "Oh HEY...isn't that...?" to be found in Airheads. But on a second viewing via Netflix, the negatives kind of balance out the positives and I give this movie a solid 5. The story left me frustrated and the comedy was eh. This movie could have been so much more. It could have been a classic, instead...it's kinda embarrassing. Stick to swinging in the trees Brendon.

    When i first saw this on Movieplex one Sunday morning, i couldn't turn away from the TV. it was nonstop hilarious. i think this is Brenden Faser's best film. i loved this movie because it stars three comedic guys and its in the 90s and i love 90s movies. after watching this film, it made me wanna go out and start a band. every time i see Steve Buechemi, he is funny but in this movie, he really stands out. i love this movie so much that i'm gonna watch it again! i just cannot express how funny this movie is so you'll have to check it out for yourself. i am so glad that i found this movie because if i didn't, i'd really be missing out on a classic 1994 film.

    All I can say is that a movie which stars Brendon Fraser, Steve Buschemi, and Adam Sandler must be good. Actually, when I first saw this movie, I did not know who any of the above were, I just thought that the adds in the cinema looked cool, hired the video, loved it, and finally ended up buying it. Last night when we watched it, we discussed about what memorable nineties comedies were. We concluded that Empire Records, Airheads, and Clueless would leave something very memorable. As for British Comedies, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. I need not say any more. Anyway, Airheads is about three guys who have written what they considered to be a really cool song, but none of the record companies want to hear it. So they try to get it played on the air after breaking into the radio station KBBL Rebel Radio. After an initial refusal, out come some very real looking water pistols. This movie, though seeming very shallow, is actually quite deep. The major theme in this movie is that music is not what we like, but what the record companies want to sell. This is clearly seen when they are in a nightclub watching a band called the Son's of Thunder, whom lost to their band, the Lone Rangers, at a battle of the bands, yet the Son's of Thunder received the contract. Just because music is good does not mean that the record companies are going to sell it. This movie is in fact very scathing of the record industry, and the entertainment industry in particular. They do not want to know this band until they hold up the radio station and gain so much publicity that they can see a lot of money. As such they snatch up the band in an instant, and try to get a contract signed before anybody else does. They are not interested in the song, they simply want the money that their publicity will bring. Chez is completely the opposite. He wants to do it for the music, and the lifestyle. Even though he wants the money, it is the music that's important, and what is more important is that they show their fans that they can play this music and it is not some lame act buy people that are loved playing a song that an unknown wrote. This is seen when Chez uses the contract as toilet paper after learning that it was written up without hearing the song. The other interesting part of this show is the scene where Chez's past is revealed. The SWAT officer tries to turn his popularity against him by revealing that he was a school nerd who played dungeons and dragons. The great thing about this scene is that after mulling over it for a bit, others began to own up to these secret desires, showing that it is not a thing that nerds simply do, and if you have done the things then who really cares anyway. What these guys want is somebody who is real, not some plastered statue created by the record companies to simply sell records. I love this movie. The humor is witty, but it goes beyond simple comedy to really bring out what the essence of music is. Music is what you enjoy, not something to make money. There are so many instances in this movie where this is brought out. Another scene is where Chez is going through the CDs and realises that most of them are not played because the radio station does not want to play them. In this movie we see the struggle between doing something for money and doing something for the love of it. Chez does this because he loves it while the station manager wants the money. If the owners tell him to change, he isn't going to argue because he wants the money and does not care about the music. We see that doing something simply for love in the ends wins people over, because not only do a whole heap of people rock up at the radio station to cheer them on, but people in the radio station take their side as well.

    Heavy metal trio The Lone Rangers haven't had much luck getting their songs heard. During their last desperate trip to a radio station they bring along some genuine looking water pistols and spontaneously pull them out when they're turned down again. One of the workers at the station escapes being taken hostage and calls the police, and a long standoff ensues until the Rangers can play their tape, which the lead singer gave to his now ex-girlfriend... Airheads is one of those films you either love or hate. When this movie first came out, I thought it was great and very funny. Nearly twenty years later, it's still funny, but for different reasons. Mantegna is the best thing in this movie, followed by Buscemi. Fraser is Fraser, and you can tell Sandler is just in waiting, and his star deservedly shone two years later. But the thing that makes this film work isn't the situation, nor the three leads, it's the randomness of it all. One minute, Egon and Winson from ghostbusters are there, next we see Lemmy! totally ridiculous, but it works, just.

    The Lone Rangers (all 3 of them) are hard up to get a record deal, they try everything. After the lead singer/guitarist gets kicked out of his girlfriends apt. he knows he must make it happen. The three of them burst into a radio station begging for their demo to be played. When their demands aren't met they hold the station up with fake guns and go on air and get all the rockers in the city involved. The band learns many lessons, the DJ learns of how dirty his boss is, and the cops learn they have their work cut out for them on this wild rock and roll hostage comedy. This movie came out in 94 when things like Waynes World was still in everyones mind. Rock and Roll was still breathing and hair metal had all but died, but MTV was still playing videos and keeping it popular enough for this movie to work. I have seen this a few times and it never did much for me, it has some okay music including Motorhead and White Zombie, but it also has a lot of crappy music that is now very dated. It isn't very funny, but it's worth a watch. Brendon Frasure did okay in his early movies and I can say that here too. Steve Buscemi is always great, but he seemed much more vibrant and youthful here, which was a different side of him as he usually plays a boring serious sarcastic character. Adam Sandler was at the height of his SNL stardom and he is a horrible actor, always has been. Other great performances can be seen by people like Ernie Hudson as a cop, Harold Ramis, Ernies Ghostbuster partner can be seen here in a small role, Chris Farley playing the silly fat guy as he done so well, Michael McKean as a yuppie radio station owner, Joe Mantegna as a long haired DJ, David Arquette also as a crazy surfer dude working at the station and Michael Richards playing a crazy employee of the station who spends the entire movie hiding in the air ducts. Judd Nelson plays an uptight record studio president, the same company name used in Waynes World. Lemmy from Motorhead has a cameo here and white zombie play live in a bar, even MTV'S dinosaur VJ Kurt Loder makes a cameo. My problem with it was that it just wasn't rock and roll enough for me. Why does the fender on Brendans motorcycle say "fag"? Also I hated that Beavis and Butthead called in at the radio station, that was stupid... 4/10 stars, worth a watch, but nothing great...not a true rock and roll movie.

    Airheads entertainingly tells an amiable story which captures the attention and interest throughout its running time. Wholly improbable, this doesn't matter - one enjoys the company of most of the characters, and one is (as intended) annoyed by the duplicitous station manager and the idiotic gung-go SWAT chief. It isn't actually that funny, mind you, but it's still entertaining. And it's notable for early appearances by a fair number of people in the early stages of their careers before they became major successes. Each of them plays somewhat contrary to the types they have subsequently become known for, and each shows signs of the stars they are to become. Steve Buscemi must get the nod for favourite performance, though.

Wholly improbable, this doesn't matter - one enjoys the company of most of the characters, and one is (as intended) annoyed by the duplicitous station manager and the idiotic gung-go SWAT chief. It isn't actually that funny, mind you, but it's still entertaining. And it's notable for early appearances by a fair number of people in the early stages of their careers before they became major successes. Each of them plays somewhat contrary to the types they have subsequently become known for, and each shows signs of the stars they are to become. Steve Buscemi must get the nod for favourite performance, though.

    The Lone Rangers, an unsigned, self-proclaimed "power slop" band, consisting of guitarist Chazz Darby (Fraser), bassist Rex (Buscemi) and drummer Pip (Sandler), takes over a radio station so they can get their demo played on the air, and hopefully get a record contract. The whole thing goes spiraling downhill when their demo is destroyed, and while trying to escape, the boys come to realize that the radio station has become surrounded by the police. The Lone Rangers take the radio station and it's staff hostage with water guns that look like Uzis (filled with hot sauce) and with all their might try to get their demo to get some airplay as a crowd of soon-to-be fans gathers at the station to follow the mayhem. Now, the only reason I wanted to watch 'Airheads' in the first place was because I saw on the TV section of the newspapers that the wonderful Steve Buscemi would be starring in it. I was certainly not expecting it to be as funny as it turned out to be. I've never been a huge fan of Brendan Fraser and I still have a strong dislike for Adam Sandler, but this trio came together in 'Airheads' and created something so funny I laugh out loud whenever I think about some if it's moments, which does earn me the occasional glance in a public bus. Being a big fan of heavy metal myself, I was happily surprised to see White Zombie AND Lemmy himself in cameos, and the movie delivered some hilarious and original dialogue. As with every movie, it does have it's flaws; some of the jokes just don't deliver, and the character of the man hiding in the air ducts was, in my opinion, a bit too dramatic and silly. The big finale on the rooftop of the KPPX building was also a bit too weird for my taste. If you're looking for a simple and funny movie to rock your world, 'Airheads' is the one to go for!

    I just got this movie and I really like this film. I was not expecting this to be much, but as usual, I am wrong. This film is about three guys who are in a band and nobody listens to their music. They decide to break in a radio station and take over the place and people as hostages. The acting is excellent and the chemistry is great. Sandler and Buscemi are hilarious. They are the best part of the film. The script and the basic plot line worked well together. I liked the music for the film. I am not a big fan of this kind of music, but somehow Sandler and the gang just made the music work. I recommend this movie for everybody. I rate this film a 9/10.

    Adam Sandler, Brendon Frazer and Steve Buscemi star in this hilarious comedy that proves that movies that take risks pay off. The film is about 3 not so smart striving rock stars who after they get blown off on a radio show with an obnoxious boss and stuck up radio leader. Well from then they end up holding up the place and there leads to an hilarious movie. This movie is a very funny one Adam Sandler did very well in not to say the other 2 main character did not as even the cameos and co stars did a good job in this film. Overall the movie is extremely funny and I think is the funniest Adam Sandler movie that he does not star outrightly in. I rate this movie a fair 73% for keeping me laughing the whole way

    Three band members hoping for a big break head to a radio station to play their demo tape and wind up holding everyone hostage with plastic guns when the head DJ is unable to play them. To say this film is a good one from a critical standpoint is a lie, as it is pretty bad in a multitude of ways. But as far as 1990s comedies go, or films connected to "Saturday Night Live" (this one very loosely), this ranks up there in entertainment value. If nothing else, the cast sells this -- David Arquette and Michael Richards before their prime. Adam Sandler at his peak. Brendan Fraser in a transition from Pauly Shore to "real" films... and Steve Buscemi? This is just loaded with talent. The music will not appeal to everyone. Even as a fan of metal, I have to say a lot of the music is not as top-notch as it probably should be.

    I saw this flick in the theaters way back (1994). I'm a band guy, not professionally, but it eats up a lot of my time as a hobby and every so often I like to revisit some movies having to do with music. On a positive note, I still love the music and the amount of rocker cameos and a huge cast of "Oh HEY...isn't that...?" to be found in Airheads. But on a second viewing via Netflix, the negatives kind of balance out the positives and I give this movie a solid 5. The story left me frustrated and the comedy was eh. This movie could have been so much more. It could have been a classic, instead...it's kinda embarrassing. Stick to swinging in the trees Brendon.

    When i first saw this on Movieplex one Sunday morning, i couldn't turn away from the TV. it was nonstop hilarious. i think this is Brenden Faser's best film. i loved this movie because it stars three comedic guys and its in the 90s and i love 90s movies. after watching this film, it made me wanna go out and start a band. every time i see Steve Buechemi, he is funny but in this movie, he really stands out. i love this movie so much that i'm gonna watch it again! i just cannot express how funny this movie is so you'll have to check it out for yourself. i am so glad that i found this movie because if i didn't, i'd really be missing out on a classic 1994 film.

    All I can say is that a movie which stars Brendon Fraser, Steve Buschemi, and Adam Sandler must be good. Actually, when I first saw this movie, I did not know who any of the above were, I just thought that the adds in the cinema looked cool, hired the video, loved it, and finally ended up buying it. Last night when we watched it, we discussed about what memorable nineties comedies were. We concluded that Empire Records, Airheads, and Clueless would leave something very memorable. As for British Comedies, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. I need not say any more. Anyway, Airheads is about three guys who have written what they considered to be a really cool song, but none of the record companies want to hear it. So they try to get it played on the air after breaking into the radio station KBBL Rebel Radio. After an initial refusal, out come some very real looking water pistols. This movie, though seeming very shallow, is actually quite deep. The major theme in this movie is that music is not what we like, but what the record companies want to sell. This is clearly seen when they are in a nightclub watching a band called the Son's of Thunder, whom lost to their band, the Lone Rangers, at a battle of the bands, yet the Son's of Thunder received the contract. Just because music is good does not mean that the record companies are going to sell it. This movie is in fact very scathing of the record industry, and the entertainment industry in particular. They do not want to know this band until they hold up the radio station and gain so much publicity that they can see a lot of money. As such they snatch up the band in an instant, and try to get a contract signed before anybody else does. They are not interested in the song, they simply want the money that their publicity will bring. Chez is completely the opposite. He wants to do it for the music, and the lifestyle. Even though he wants the money, it is the music that's important, and what is more important is that they show their fans that they can play this music and it is not some lame act buy people that are loved playing a song that an unknown wrote. This is seen when Chez uses the contract as toilet paper after learning that it was written up without hearing the song. The other interesting part of this show is the scene where Chez's past is revealed. The SWAT officer tries to turn his popularity against him by revealing that he was a school nerd who played dungeons and dragons. The great thing about this scene is that after mulling over it for a bit, others began to own up to these secret desires, showing that it is not a thing that nerds simply do, and if you have done the things then who really cares anyway. What these guys want is somebody who is real, not some plastered statue created by the record companies to simply sell records. I love this movie. The humor is witty, but it goes beyond simple comedy to really bring out what the essence of music is. Music is what you enjoy, not something to make money. There are so many instances in this movie where this is brought out. Another scene is where Chez is going through the CDs and realises that most of them are not played because the radio station does not want to play them. In this movie we see the struggle between doing something for money and doing something for the love of it. Chez does this because he loves it while the station manager wants the money. If the owners tell him to change, he isn't going to argue because he wants the money and does not care about the music. We see that doing something simply for love in the ends wins people over, because not only do a whole heap of people rock up at the radio station to cheer them on, but people in the radio station take their side as well.

    Heavy metal trio The Lone Rangers haven't had much luck getting their songs heard. During their last desperate trip to a radio station they bring along some genuine looking water pistols and spontaneously pull them out when they're turned down again. One of the workers at the station escapes being taken hostage and calls the police, and a long standoff ensues until the Rangers can play their tape, which the lead singer gave to his now ex-girlfriend... Airheads is one of those films you either love or hate. When this movie first came out, I thought it was great and very funny. Nearly twenty years later, it's still funny, but for different reasons. Mantegna is the best thing in this movie, followed by Buscemi. Fraser is Fraser, and you can tell Sandler is just in waiting, and his star deservedly shone two years later. But the thing that makes this film work isn't the situation, nor the three leads, it's the randomness of it all. One minute, Egon and Winson from ghostbusters are there, next we see Lemmy! totally ridiculous, but it works, just.

    The Lone Rangers (all 3 of them) are hard up to get a record deal, they try everything. After the lead singer/guitarist gets kicked out of his girlfriends apt. he knows he must make it happen. The three of them burst into a radio station begging for their demo to be played. When their demands aren't met they hold the station up with fake guns and go on air and get all the rockers in the city involved. The band learns many lessons, the DJ learns of how dirty his boss is, and the cops learn they have their work cut out for them on this wild rock and roll hostage comedy. This movie came out in 94 when things like Waynes World was still in everyones mind. Rock and Roll was still breathing and hair metal had all but died, but MTV was still playing videos and keeping it popular enough for this movie to work. I have seen this a few times and it never did much for me, it has some okay music including Motorhead and White Zombie, but it also has a lot of crappy music that is now very dated. It isn't very funny, but it's worth a watch. Brendon Frasure did okay in his early movies and I can say that here too. Steve Buscemi is always great, but he seemed much more vibrant and youthful here, which was a different side of him as he usually plays a boring serious sarcastic character. Adam Sandler was at the height of his SNL stardom and he is a horrible actor, always has been. Other great performances can be seen by people like Ernie Hudson as a cop, Harold Ramis, Ernies Ghostbuster partner can be seen here in a small role, Chris Farley playing the silly fat guy as he done so well, Michael McKean as a yuppie radio station owner, Joe Mantegna as a long haired DJ, David Arquette also as a crazy surfer dude working at the station and Michael Richards playing a crazy employee of the station who spends the entire movie hiding in the air ducts. Judd Nelson plays an uptight record studio president, the same company name used in Waynes World. Lemmy from Motorhead has a cameo here and white zombie play live in a bar, even MTV'S dinosaur VJ Kurt Loder makes a cameo. My problem with it was that it just wasn't rock and roll enough for me. Why does the fender on Brendans motorcycle say "fag"? Also I hated that Beavis and Butthead called in at the radio station, that was stupid... 4/10 stars, worth a watch, but nothing great...not a true rock and roll movie.

Lemmy from Motorhead has a cameo here and white zombie play live in a bar, even MTV'S dinosaur VJ Kurt Loder makes a cameo. My problem with it was that it just wasn't rock and roll enough for me. Why does the fender on Brendans motorcycle say "fag"? Also I hated that Beavis and Butthead called in at the radio station, that was stupid... 4/10 stars, worth a watch, but nothing great...not a true rock and roll movie.

    Airheads entertainingly tells an amiable story which captures the attention and interest throughout its running time. Wholly improbable, this doesn't matter - one enjoys the company of most of the characters, and one is (as intended) annoyed by the duplicitous station manager and the idiotic gung-go SWAT chief. It isn't actually that funny, mind you, but it's still entertaining. And it's notable for early appearances by a fair number of people in the early stages of their careers before they became major successes. Each of them plays somewhat contrary to the types they have subsequently become known for, and each shows signs of the stars they are to become. Steve Buscemi must get the nod for favourite performance, though.

    The Lone Rangers, an unsigned, self-proclaimed "power slop" band, consisting of guitarist Chazz Darby (Fraser), bassist Rex (Buscemi) and drummer Pip (Sandler), takes over a radio station so they can get their demo played on the air, and hopefully get a record contract. The whole thing goes spiraling downhill when their demo is destroyed, and while trying to escape, the boys come to realize that the radio station has become surrounded by the police. The Lone Rangers take the radio station and it's staff hostage with water guns that look like Uzis (filled with hot sauce) and with all their might try to get their demo to get some airplay as a crowd of soon-to-be fans gathers at the station to follow the mayhem. Now, the only reason I wanted to watch 'Airheads' in the first place was because I saw on the TV section of the newspapers that the wonderful Steve Buscemi would be starring in it. I was certainly not expecting it to be as funny as it turned out to be. I've never been a huge fan of Brendan Fraser and I still have a strong dislike for Adam Sandler, but this trio came together in 'Airheads' and created something so funny I laugh out loud whenever I think about some if it's moments, which does earn me the occasional glance in a public bus. Being a big fan of heavy metal myself, I was happily surprised to see White Zombie AND Lemmy himself in cameos, and the movie delivered some hilarious and original dialogue. As with every movie, it does have it's flaws; some of the jokes just don't deliver, and the character of the man hiding in the air ducts was, in my opinion, a bit too dramatic and silly. The big finale on the rooftop of the KPPX building was also a bit too weird for my taste. If you're looking for a simple and funny movie to rock your world, 'Airheads' is the one to go for!

    I just got this movie and I really like this film. I was not expecting this to be much, but as usual, I am wrong. This film is about three guys who are in a band and nobody listens to their music. They decide to break in a radio station and take over the place and people as hostages. The acting is excellent and the chemistry is great. Sandler and Buscemi are hilarious. They are the best part of the film. The script and the basic plot line worked well together. I liked the music for the film. I am not a big fan of this kind of music, but somehow Sandler and the gang just made the music work. I recommend this movie for everybody. I rate this film a 9/10.

    Adam Sandler, Brendon Frazer and Steve Buscemi star in this hilarious comedy that proves that movies that take risks pay off. The film is about 3 not so smart striving rock stars who after they get blown off on a radio show with an obnoxious boss and stuck up radio leader. Well from then they end up holding up the place and there leads to an hilarious movie. This movie is a very funny one Adam Sandler did very well in not to say the other 2 main character did not as even the cameos and co stars did a good job in this film. Overall the movie is extremely funny and I think is the funniest Adam Sandler movie that he does not star outrightly in. I rate this movie a fair 73% for keeping me laughing the whole way
