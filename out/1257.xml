    I would have enjoyed seeing Wallace Shawn act out his main character thought Nichols was unforgettable. The vexing detail about this play of course is that one has to listen to get it; a bother I know. It is not, it seems to me,about literature or pompousness or affectation. It is just about character and circumstance, like all great stories, particularly potent in an environment where political fundamentalists get closer to power. It is like any Hollywood story; develop characters, setting and intro duce the plot. When events start to unfold in this story it is unbelievably chilling and you can realize, with a start, that some place in the world this kind of terror is happening to people very much like us, right now. While Texan's are rewriting their history text books to accommodate a brand of right wing thought experiment, people with contempt for free thought scheme for power - Tom Delay wanted to do away with much you enjoy in this country and he got close; we should pay better attention to our own literature.

    This is a tough one. I couldn't decide if I should continue to patiently listen to the rest of this film or shoot myself in the head. Listening to this sea of blathering words, sometimes flowing other times ejaculating out of the actors mouths is a very trying experience. This film features the mental masturbation of of 3 actors, but mainly Mike Nichols. It seems to intend to reveal and exercise the motives and experience of human existence. However it had me rolling my eyes with annoyance at the implied self-importance, grandiose style imagery, pompous "dry" humor had me spinning on the floor with boredom. And on a very personal note, Mike Nichols verbalization of his 'erotic' impressions were downright creepy to me as a woman. He's that prototypical rich, successful old man who has always been deferred to and given positive attention from woman for their own practical reasons. But in his egotism he deludes himself into believing HE is what they admire rather than the money and power. So the Lothario, yet in reality, couldn't please a woman with a 10" vibrator and a million dollars in cash. Yet we have to listen endlessly to his sexual imagery that would turn-off a cat in heat. I am going to go load my gun now.

    There are a lot of negative comments about this film, but I have to say that I found it truly riveting and loved every second of it. I thought it was really interesting and the descriptions made it so easy to visualise the situations. Miranda Richardsons performance was amazing, one of her best, as were Mike Nichols and David De Keyser. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I was quite surprised that I enjoyed so much, since the basic plot is three people sat around a table for an hour and a half, but when they talk about events they really transport you to another world, another time. The lighting was very atmospheric and aided the story telling, I use the words story telling simply because I cannot think of any better expression. In all honesty, it was more like watching a painting move than watching a film, it was so beautiful. I gave this piece 10 out of 10.

    Before you consider renting this, consider the fact that it is a filmed stage play consisting of three people at a table talking not to each other but to the person watching. Nobody here has mentioned the coloring of each scene. There is some significance here. If you enjoy a true exercise in using your little grey cells, you will enjoy this. If you enjoy watching skilled actors talking ideas, you will enjoy it. Don't look for action or plot. This is only for people who love thinking, who are able to live in the world of the mind.

    I remember seeing this film at the theatre and hoping to God that it would end soon, really soon. The film has no action or interaction what-so-ever. The characters are only speaking into the camera, telling you the story of the film. I would say this is along the lines of the theatre of the absurd, like Ianesco, but unlike Ianesco, I was not able to visualize what the characters were relating. I think it was because they were staring me straight in the face. That, and Mike Nichols has that face you can't take seriously. Especially when he is talking about masturbation and crapping on people's writings. He should stick to directing. In all fairness, the last scene in the movie was really moving and gave me goose bumps. Unfortunately, I waited for what seemed like years for this to happen. Honestly, I think this was a great story, but it should never have been made into a film, and surely not as it was made. I would have much preferred to have read the play (or script) and had my own vision of what was happening instead of being stared at in the face by the characters. As a book, or play it would have been brilliant. As a movie it sucked. I give it a 3 because it was a good story but was a disaster as a film. Don't waste your time unless you like books on tape and don't plan on sitting down to actually watch Mike Nichols talk about his penis and fecal fantasies.

    'The Designated Mourner', a play by Wallace Shawn, is above all else an exercise in writing. Three people (in this adaptation by David Hare, sat statically throughout in one of two locations, one of which appears to be a television news desk, the other a table in a small caf&eacute;), discuss their relationship. But although they respond to each other in tone, they rarely directly address the subject material that the others refer to; and the wider backdrop to their personal story, a crypto-fascist coup, is mentioned only elliptically by all three participants, just as it might be in real conversation where certain things would be taken as known. But there's little that's naturalistic or conventionally conversational about these carefully constructed interlaced monologues; they better represent the inner voices of self-justification (or alternatively, the voices of published autobiography). In spite of the artifice, one does develop a sophisticated sense for the nuances of the trio's characters; everyone has an agenda, and deciphering the three unreliable narrators is exactly the point. Thi particular film of the play is well acted, and it's probably sensible that Hare has chosen to add very little to the basic script (having made this decision, almost his only work as director is to choose when to cut between alternative close-ups). But while theatre has to work within certain intrinsic limitations (and offers you the benefits of live performance as a compensation), cinema does not and in this sense, this seems a strange work to put on screen. Nonetheless, it's still an interesting experiment, and worth watching if you like your drama wordy and cerebral.

    I happened by complete accident on this film late last night on BBC 2; and although I had to arise early the next morning, there was NO WAY I could do anything but watch it to the end. I'll have to watch it again - maybe more than once - to discover all the nuances in the wonderful dialogue, but for me the performance of Mike Nichols (whom I remember as half of the wildly funny Nichols and May) was amazing and totally riveting. For that alone - and the complex and all-too-human nature of the character he plays - it was well worth viewing and re-viewing (and reviewing!). This is not to denigrate the other actors' contributions; It's just that Nichols' was so memorable. So September's license fee is already justified . . .

    I stumbled across this film late one night, as if i had stumbled into a dream, one i couldn't draw myself from. The lack of set puts all emphasis on the long monologues, which are delivered with such riveting feeling that the character's words fail not to touch you in someway.The script seems split between drawing from reality's loneliness and hurt, and poetry's cutting imagery and sentiment, which altogether creates some haunting myth.The entire cast (numbering but three and including a fabulous Miranda Richardson)are thoroughly engaging-Mike Nickols carries the film admirably-their characters seem locked in the retelling of the story, utterly lost in the memories and who can help but reflect the feelings of identity and loneliness upon themselves.

    This is a very funny film, especially for anyone who has been to a University party with self congratulatory, self aggrandising pretentious smart alecs. The whole film is done in the same 'high-brow' style whether it is the weepy self pity and anguish of Judy or the prurient, ignorant, though arguably more accessible filth of Jack. This is VERY trying, it is what turns most people off the film but is also entirely the point. This film would have been better served if it had been a lot shorter as it would have made the same points and been more accessible at the same time. The main benefit of it's length is the increased time to include the snappy one liners that helped to lighten the mood of the monotony.

    A drama of evolving inconsequence may evoke a certain appeal, as we hear the meandering rambling from one to another, the authors describe each other and themselves, analyze and criticize without arriving at any apparent conclusion or plateau of resolution. A seemingly unapparent effort in arousing suspicion amongst it's audience-in an effort to suggest a deeper meaning, a plot or subtext (this quite obviously is non existent) And yet, they continue to groan and meet with more intimate resolution as the 'play' takes a more detailed step forward, only to be rudely interrupted by their chief protagonist 'Jack' The whole affair reminds me of production meeting of a fictitious film company, with fictitious goals, offering pointless objectives based upon circumstances manipulated at their leisure as a means to perpetuate their overtly pointless existences. Still, it inspires writing in others, and indicates a challenge to conventional wisdom of broadcasting commissioners. Overwhelmingly describes the tedious equation of life over time, as seen through the eyes of the oppressed middle classes, with no drive or enthusiasm remaining-or perhaps they are simply too boring to inject the juice into their lives once more. Did somebody die?-I forget If you manage to read this review and find your brain elsewhere by the second paragraph, do yourself a favor- rent Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey!
