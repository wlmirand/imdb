 <storyline>
  This film tells two interwoven stories of two single-parent families in a poor, racially-mixed neighborhood in Brooklyn. The first story is about a young black man (with aspirations of getting away from his friends who are involved in drugs) who falls in love with a latino girl (who is heading off to college on a full scholarship). The second is about their parents, (she works in the neighborhood liquor store; he works for the phone company). The story takes place against the backdrop of a winning lottery ticket worth $27 million being sold to someone in the neighborhood from the liquor store.

    I just stumbled across this little gem, despite having actually been in the Park Slope area where it was filmed during that period. Although made as a low budget independent, Lotto Land really has a soul, and Rubino serves up a solid story with real character development and believable performances. Casting, with mostly little-known actors, is dead-on, with even the smallest roles nailing it. Despite the gritty neighborhood, drug dealing and R-rated content, this is [dare I say it] ultimately a feel-good film that pays off. The film had a limited run in art houses, and I caught it on video, but apparently it's now available on DVD, which you should definitely get in order to do justice to the great soundtrack from the Holmes Brothers.

    A small independent NY production. Acting was the highlight, production was satisfactory throughout, considering the limitations of time and production muscle. As with all films that are essentially "theatrical", that rely on a story and the protagonists, Lotto Land ultimately is no better than its script, which in this case is average. A comedy in the Greek sense - boy meets girl until the happy ending - is updated to a contemporary NY setting. Fatherless boy, alcoholism, the struggles to survive in the city. Successful in the detailing, the film can only mildly rise up to the emotion transcendence that is the aim of the genre. However, for all movie buffs, certainly an enjoyable view.
