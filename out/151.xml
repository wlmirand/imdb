 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The world is astounded when Willy Wonka, for years a recluse in his factory, announces that five lucky people will be given a tour of the factory, shown all the secrets of his amazing candy, and one will win a lifetime supply of Wonka chocolate. Nobody wants the prize more than young Charlie, but as his family is so poor that buying even one bar of chocolate is a treat, buying enough bars to find one of the five golden tickets is unlikely in the extreme. But in movieland, magic can happen. Charlie, along with four somewhat odious other children, get the chance of a lifetime and a tour of the factory. Along the way, mild disasters befall each of the odious children, but can Charlie beat the odds and grab the brass ring?

    One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.

    This movie is phenomenal on all accounts. I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately. To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?) Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.

    There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence. Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor. This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's. Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite. I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner". "Bull--". "No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet". Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie. So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket. Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

    Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.

    "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" has always been one of my favorite readings. I Discovered Roald Dahl's classic in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether for the Wonka bars or other candies, the story always gave me to eat chocolate. Another aspect of the novel grabbed my attention: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built following the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light, which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones, with the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments. As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book, finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and natural appeal for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid, who sets a positive example, to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character ever, although the two films didn't exactly give much depth and substance to the titular hero. Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka, rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, with all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film, to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct. But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, but they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "The Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's, the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man" Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book. Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression, that would be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance. I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a brilliant movie with a lovely storyline,a good cast and fantastic characters.This movie is one of my favourite movies from my childhood,I was looking through some of my old DVD's and when I saw this,I just had to watch it,and it still holds up really well today.I remember when my mom took me to see the Tim Burton remake,it was terrible,it loses all the heart we get in this movie.Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is one of the greatest performances in any family movie ever.Fans of the beloved Roald Dahl children's book and people who enjoy feel good family movies will definitely enjoy this movie very much. When a competition occurs where only five people can win a chance to visit a famous chocolate factory,huge competition begins to win one of the five golden tickets in the chocolate bar.

    Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

    I got to the name of this one because of the remake "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which at the time I thought was an original new movie but turned out to be a boring movie with no soul, great special effects but crude settings and visuals, annoying kids, a creepy Willy Wonka and a ridiculous and unnecessary longer ending. This one, the original, is the "THE" version. Despite some inconsistencies and flaws, at least it's much better made and has soul and authenticity, colorful and extravagant contents, beautiful settings (it takes place in Munich, Germany). Admittedly, there are many similarities between the two versions, yet they're as different as night and day and/or as water and wine. Let's face it, Gene Wilder *IS* Willy Wonka. "His" Willy Wonka is very eccentric without overdoing that nature of his. "Johnny Depp's" Willy Wonka is a creep, a weirdo, like a combination of Michael Jackson and Jos&eacute; Castelo Branco! Plus, Johnny Depp is overrated as an actor. Gene Wilder, now that's real acting! The story is familiar: 5 lucky children live the unique experience of visiting the world's most original,fantastic, wonderful and advanced factory: Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory! The kids are: Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee and Charlie Bucket. Veruca is a most difficult girl. She can really can get on our nerves because she is extremely spoiled and bratty, and way too proud and overly demanding. She is definitely irritating, but her father is to blame either, because he spoils her too much and never denies her anything, which makes her use and abuse of her authority. In fact, she only wins the Golden Ticket by cheating in order to get ahead because her "daddy" allows that. Her "I want this and I want it now" and "I want that and I want it now" and "Nobody denies me anything" attitude is clearly over the top. Despite all, most moments with her are amusing and I like her song "I want it now". Violet, while not as spoiled and bossy, is also annoying, not only because she is a constant gum-chomping but also because of her poor behavior. Augustus Gloop, the fat boy, doesn't annoy me. He even seems like a good boy. His big mistake is that he is gluttonous and he isn't careful on that, which is also a sign of some lack of education. At the same time it proves that he isn't especially smart, the poor devil. Mike Teevee is only slightly annoying when he is introduced to us, and in one of the last scenes he shows up. Other than that, he is generally quiet and polite, just cowboy-obsessed. Charlie Bucket is one of the friendliest and nicest kids that ever graced the screen. He is very nice without being almost too nice as in the remake. The kids are all well portrayed by the actors, especially Peter Ostrum as Charlie (and to think that this was his only film role ever!). Title in Portugal: "A Maravilhosa Hist&oacute;ria de Charlie" (oh, why didn't they just call it "Willy Wonka e a F&aacute;brica de Chocolate"?)

    Gene Wilder turns in a wonderfully eerie performance as our eccentric and knowing host conducting the tour of the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, capturing a quirky but gentle nature all the while serving just deserts! While Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is our poor boy hero who can't carry a tune, his four golden ticket counterparts are sadistically spoiled and comically obnoxious and none better than Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole). We see the brats of the world groomed to be so by discipline-less and over indulgent parents. The psychedelic boat ride and poem was as macabre as they come. This was a movie musical whose purpose was to promote a candy bar and today still holds an enlightening charm without cavities!

    There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence. Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor. This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's. Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite. I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner". "Bull--". "No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet". Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie. So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket. Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

    Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.

    "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" has always been one of my favorite readings. I Discovered Roald Dahl's classic in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether for the Wonka bars or other candies, the story always gave me to eat chocolate. Another aspect of the novel grabbed my attention: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built following the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light, which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones, with the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments. As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book, finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and natural appeal for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid, who sets a positive example, to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character ever, although the two films didn't exactly give much depth and substance to the titular hero. Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka, rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, with all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film, to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct. But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, but they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "The Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's, the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man" Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book. Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression, that would be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance. I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a brilliant movie with a lovely storyline,a good cast and fantastic characters.This movie is one of my favourite movies from my childhood,I was looking through some of my old DVD's and when I saw this,I just had to watch it,and it still holds up really well today.I remember when my mom took me to see the Tim Burton remake,it was terrible,it loses all the heart we get in this movie.Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is one of the greatest performances in any family movie ever.Fans of the beloved Roald Dahl children's book and people who enjoy feel good family movies will definitely enjoy this movie very much. When a competition occurs where only five people can win a chance to visit a famous chocolate factory,huge competition begins to win one of the five golden tickets in the chocolate bar.

    Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

    I got to the name of this one because of the remake "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which at the time I thought was an original new movie but turned out to be a boring movie with no soul, great special effects but crude settings and visuals, annoying kids, a creepy Willy Wonka and a ridiculous and unnecessary longer ending. This one, the original, is the "THE" version. Despite some inconsistencies and flaws, at least it's much better made and has soul and authenticity, colorful and extravagant contents, beautiful settings (it takes place in Munich, Germany). Admittedly, there are many similarities between the two versions, yet they're as different as night and day and/or as water and wine. Let's face it, Gene Wilder *IS* Willy Wonka. "His" Willy Wonka is very eccentric without overdoing that nature of his. "Johnny Depp's" Willy Wonka is a creep, a weirdo, like a combination of Michael Jackson and Jos&eacute; Castelo Branco! Plus, Johnny Depp is overrated as an actor. Gene Wilder, now that's real acting! The story is familiar: 5 lucky children live the unique experience of visiting the world's most original,fantastic, wonderful and advanced factory: Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory! The kids are: Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee and Charlie Bucket. Veruca is a most difficult girl. She can really can get on our nerves because she is extremely spoiled and bratty, and way too proud and overly demanding. She is definitely irritating, but her father is to blame either, because he spoils her too much and never denies her anything, which makes her use and abuse of her authority. In fact, she only wins the Golden Ticket by cheating in order to get ahead because her "daddy" allows that. Her "I want this and I want it now" and "I want that and I want it now" and "Nobody denies me anything" attitude is clearly over the top. Despite all, most moments with her are amusing and I like her song "I want it now". Violet, while not as spoiled and bossy, is also annoying, not only because she is a constant gum-chomping but also because of her poor behavior. Augustus Gloop, the fat boy, doesn't annoy me. He even seems like a good boy. His big mistake is that he is gluttonous and he isn't careful on that, which is also a sign of some lack of education. At the same time it proves that he isn't especially smart, the poor devil. Mike Teevee is only slightly annoying when he is introduced to us, and in one of the last scenes he shows up. Other than that, he is generally quiet and polite, just cowboy-obsessed. Charlie Bucket is one of the friendliest and nicest kids that ever graced the screen. He is very nice without being almost too nice as in the remake. The kids are all well portrayed by the actors, especially Peter Ostrum as Charlie (and to think that this was his only film role ever!). Title in Portugal: "A Maravilhosa Hist&oacute;ria de Charlie" (oh, why didn't they just call it "Willy Wonka e a F&aacute;brica de Chocolate"?)

    Gene Wilder turns in a wonderfully eerie performance as our eccentric and knowing host conducting the tour of the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, capturing a quirky but gentle nature all the while serving just deserts! While Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is our poor boy hero who can't carry a tune, his four golden ticket counterparts are sadistically spoiled and comically obnoxious and none better than Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole). We see the brats of the world groomed to be so by discipline-less and over indulgent parents. The psychedelic boat ride and poem was as macabre as they come. This was a movie musical whose purpose was to promote a candy bar and today still holds an enlightening charm without cavities!

    One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.

    This movie is phenomenal on all accounts. I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately. To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?) Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.

Another aspect of the novel grabbed my attention: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built following the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light, which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones, with the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments. As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book, finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and natural appeal for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid, who sets a positive example, to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character ever, although the two films didn't exactly give much depth and substance to the titular hero. Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka, rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, with all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film, to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct. But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, but they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "The Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's, the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man" Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book. Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression, that would be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance. I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

    I got to the name of this one because of the remake "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which at the time I thought was an original new movie but turned out to be a boring movie with no soul, great special effects but crude settings and visuals, annoying kids, a creepy Willy Wonka and a ridiculous and unnecessary longer ending. This one, the original, is the "THE" version. Despite some inconsistencies and flaws, at least it's much better made and has soul and authenticity, colorful and extravagant contents, beautiful settings (it takes place in Munich, Germany). Admittedly, there are many similarities between the two versions, yet they're as different as night and day and/or as water and wine. Let's face it, Gene Wilder *IS* Willy Wonka. "His" Willy Wonka is very eccentric without overdoing that nature of his. "Johnny Depp's" Willy Wonka is a creep, a weirdo, like a combination of Michael Jackson and Jos&eacute; Castelo Branco! Plus, Johnny Depp is overrated as an actor. Gene Wilder, now that's real acting! The story is familiar: 5 lucky children live the unique experience of visiting the world's most original,fantastic, wonderful and advanced factory: Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory! The kids are: Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee and Charlie Bucket. Veruca is a most difficult girl. She can really can get on our nerves because she is extremely spoiled and bratty, and way too proud and overly demanding. She is definitely irritating, but her father is to blame either, because he spoils her too much and never denies her anything, which makes her use and abuse of her authority. In fact, she only wins the Golden Ticket by cheating in order to get ahead because her "daddy" allows that. Her "I want this and I want it now" and "I want that and I want it now" and "Nobody denies me anything" attitude is clearly over the top. Despite all, most moments with her are amusing and I like her song "I want it now". Violet, while not as spoiled and bossy, is also annoying, not only because she is a constant gum-chomping but also because of her poor behavior. Augustus Gloop, the fat boy, doesn't annoy me. He even seems like a good boy. His big mistake is that he is gluttonous and he isn't careful on that, which is also a sign of some lack of education. At the same time it proves that he isn't especially smart, the poor devil. Mike Teevee is only slightly annoying when he is introduced to us, and in one of the last scenes he shows up. Other than that, he is generally quiet and polite, just cowboy-obsessed. Charlie Bucket is one of the friendliest and nicest kids that ever graced the screen. He is very nice without being almost too nice as in the remake. The kids are all well portrayed by the actors, especially Peter Ostrum as Charlie (and to think that this was his only film role ever!). Title in Portugal: "A Maravilhosa Hist&oacute;ria de Charlie" (oh, why didn't they just call it "Willy Wonka e a F&aacute;brica de Chocolate"?)

    Gene Wilder turns in a wonderfully eerie performance as our eccentric and knowing host conducting the tour of the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, capturing a quirky but gentle nature all the while serving just deserts! While Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is our poor boy hero who can't carry a tune, his four golden ticket counterparts are sadistically spoiled and comically obnoxious and none better than Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole). We see the brats of the world groomed to be so by discipline-less and over indulgent parents. The psychedelic boat ride and poem was as macabre as they come. This was a movie musical whose purpose was to promote a candy bar and today still holds an enlightening charm without cavities!

    One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.

    This movie is phenomenal on all accounts. I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately. To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?) Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.

    There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence. Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor. This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's. Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite. I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner". "Bull--". "No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet". Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie. So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket. Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

    Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.

If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

    I got to the name of this one because of the remake "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which at the time I thought was an original new movie but turned out to be a boring movie with no soul, great special effects but crude settings and visuals, annoying kids, a creepy Willy Wonka and a ridiculous and unnecessary longer ending. This one, the original, is the "THE" version. Despite some inconsistencies and flaws, at least it's much better made and has soul and authenticity, colorful and extravagant contents, beautiful settings (it takes place in Munich, Germany). Admittedly, there are many similarities between the two versions, yet they're as different as night and day and/or as water and wine. Let's face it, Gene Wilder *IS* Willy Wonka. "His" Willy Wonka is very eccentric without overdoing that nature of his. "Johnny Depp's" Willy Wonka is a creep, a weirdo, like a combination of Michael Jackson and Jos&eacute; Castelo Branco! Plus, Johnny Depp is overrated as an actor. Gene Wilder, now that's real acting! The story is familiar: 5 lucky children live the unique experience of visiting the world's most original,fantastic, wonderful and advanced factory: Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory! The kids are: Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee and Charlie Bucket. Veruca is a most difficult girl. She can really can get on our nerves because she is extremely spoiled and bratty, and way too proud and overly demanding. She is definitely irritating, but her father is to blame either, because he spoils her too much and never denies her anything, which makes her use and abuse of her authority. In fact, she only wins the Golden Ticket by cheating in order to get ahead because her "daddy" allows that. Her "I want this and I want it now" and "I want that and I want it now" and "Nobody denies me anything" attitude is clearly over the top. Despite all, most moments with her are amusing and I like her song "I want it now". Violet, while not as spoiled and bossy, is also annoying, not only because she is a constant gum-chomping but also because of her poor behavior. Augustus Gloop, the fat boy, doesn't annoy me. He even seems like a good boy. His big mistake is that he is gluttonous and he isn't careful on that, which is also a sign of some lack of education. At the same time it proves that he isn't especially smart, the poor devil. Mike Teevee is only slightly annoying when he is introduced to us, and in one of the last scenes he shows up. Other than that, he is generally quiet and polite, just cowboy-obsessed. Charlie Bucket is one of the friendliest and nicest kids that ever graced the screen. He is very nice without being almost too nice as in the remake. The kids are all well portrayed by the actors, especially Peter Ostrum as Charlie (and to think that this was his only film role ever!). Title in Portugal: "A Maravilhosa Hist&oacute;ria de Charlie" (oh, why didn't they just call it "Willy Wonka e a F&aacute;brica de Chocolate"?)

    Gene Wilder turns in a wonderfully eerie performance as our eccentric and knowing host conducting the tour of the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, capturing a quirky but gentle nature all the while serving just deserts! While Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is our poor boy hero who can't carry a tune, his four golden ticket counterparts are sadistically spoiled and comically obnoxious and none better than Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole). We see the brats of the world groomed to be so by discipline-less and over indulgent parents. The psychedelic boat ride and poem was as macabre as they come. This was a movie musical whose purpose was to promote a candy bar and today still holds an enlightening charm without cavities!

    One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.

    This movie is phenomenal on all accounts. I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately. To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?) Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.

    There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence. Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor. This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's. Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite. I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner". "Bull--". "No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet". Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie. So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket. Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

    Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.

    "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" has always been one of my favorite readings. I Discovered Roald Dahl's classic in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether for the Wonka bars or other candies, the story always gave me to eat chocolate. Another aspect of the novel grabbed my attention: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built following the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light, which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones, with the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments. As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book, finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and natural appeal for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid, who sets a positive example, to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character ever, although the two films didn't exactly give much depth and substance to the titular hero. Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka, rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, with all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film, to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct. But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, but they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "The Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's, the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man" Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book. Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression, that would be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance. I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a brilliant movie with a lovely storyline,a good cast and fantastic characters.This movie is one of my favourite movies from my childhood,I was looking through some of my old DVD's and when I saw this,I just had to watch it,and it still holds up really well today.I remember when my mom took me to see the Tim Burton remake,it was terrible,it loses all the heart we get in this movie.Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is one of the greatest performances in any family movie ever.Fans of the beloved Roald Dahl children's book and people who enjoy feel good family movies will definitely enjoy this movie very much. When a competition occurs where only five people can win a chance to visit a famous chocolate factory,huge competition begins to win one of the five golden tickets in the chocolate bar.

    Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.

    There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence. Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor. This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's. Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite. I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner". "Bull--". "No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet". Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie. So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket. Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

    Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.

    "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" has always been one of my favorite readings. I Discovered Roald Dahl's classic in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether for the Wonka bars or other candies, the story always gave me to eat chocolate. Another aspect of the novel grabbed my attention: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built following the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light, which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones, with the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments. As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book, finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and natural appeal for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid, who sets a positive example, to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character ever, although the two films didn't exactly give much depth and substance to the titular hero. Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka, rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, with all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film, to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct. But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, but they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "The Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's, the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man" Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book. Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression, that would be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance. I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a brilliant movie with a lovely storyline,a good cast and fantastic characters.This movie is one of my favourite movies from my childhood,I was looking through some of my old DVD's and when I saw this,I just had to watch it,and it still holds up really well today.I remember when my mom took me to see the Tim Burton remake,it was terrible,it loses all the heart we get in this movie.Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is one of the greatest performances in any family movie ever.Fans of the beloved Roald Dahl children's book and people who enjoy feel good family movies will definitely enjoy this movie very much. When a competition occurs where only five people can win a chance to visit a famous chocolate factory,huge competition begins to win one of the five golden tickets in the chocolate bar.

    Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

    I got to the name of this one because of the remake "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which at the time I thought was an original new movie but turned out to be a boring movie with no soul, great special effects but crude settings and visuals, annoying kids, a creepy Willy Wonka and a ridiculous and unnecessary longer ending. This one, the original, is the "THE" version. Despite some inconsistencies and flaws, at least it's much better made and has soul and authenticity, colorful and extravagant contents, beautiful settings (it takes place in Munich, Germany). Admittedly, there are many similarities between the two versions, yet they're as different as night and day and/or as water and wine. Let's face it, Gene Wilder *IS* Willy Wonka. "His" Willy Wonka is very eccentric without overdoing that nature of his. "Johnny Depp's" Willy Wonka is a creep, a weirdo, like a combination of Michael Jackson and Jos&eacute; Castelo Branco! Plus, Johnny Depp is overrated as an actor. Gene Wilder, now that's real acting! The story is familiar: 5 lucky children live the unique experience of visiting the world's most original,fantastic, wonderful and advanced factory: Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory! The kids are: Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee and Charlie Bucket. Veruca is a most difficult girl. She can really can get on our nerves because she is extremely spoiled and bratty, and way too proud and overly demanding. She is definitely irritating, but her father is to blame either, because he spoils her too much and never denies her anything, which makes her use and abuse of her authority. In fact, she only wins the Golden Ticket by cheating in order to get ahead because her "daddy" allows that. Her "I want this and I want it now" and "I want that and I want it now" and "Nobody denies me anything" attitude is clearly over the top. Despite all, most moments with her are amusing and I like her song "I want it now". Violet, while not as spoiled and bossy, is also annoying, not only because she is a constant gum-chomping but also because of her poor behavior. Augustus Gloop, the fat boy, doesn't annoy me. He even seems like a good boy. His big mistake is that he is gluttonous and he isn't careful on that, which is also a sign of some lack of education. At the same time it proves that he isn't especially smart, the poor devil. Mike Teevee is only slightly annoying when he is introduced to us, and in one of the last scenes he shows up. Other than that, he is generally quiet and polite, just cowboy-obsessed. Charlie Bucket is one of the friendliest and nicest kids that ever graced the screen. He is very nice without being almost too nice as in the remake. The kids are all well portrayed by the actors, especially Peter Ostrum as Charlie (and to think that this was his only film role ever!). Title in Portugal: "A Maravilhosa Hist&oacute;ria de Charlie" (oh, why didn't they just call it "Willy Wonka e a F&aacute;brica de Chocolate"?)

    Gene Wilder turns in a wonderfully eerie performance as our eccentric and knowing host conducting the tour of the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, capturing a quirky but gentle nature all the while serving just deserts! While Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is our poor boy hero who can't carry a tune, his four golden ticket counterparts are sadistically spoiled and comically obnoxious and none better than Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole). We see the brats of the world groomed to be so by discipline-less and over indulgent parents. The psychedelic boat ride and poem was as macabre as they come. This was a movie musical whose purpose was to promote a candy bar and today still holds an enlightening charm without cavities!

    One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.

AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket.

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite.

Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

    Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.

    "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" has always been one of my favorite readings. I Discovered Roald Dahl's classic in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether for the Wonka bars or other candies, the story always gave me to eat chocolate. Another aspect of the novel grabbed my attention: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built following the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light, which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones, with the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments. As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book, finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and natural appeal for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid, who sets a positive example, to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character ever, although the two films didn't exactly give much depth and substance to the titular hero. Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka, rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, with all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film, to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct. But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, but they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "The Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's, the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man" Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book. Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression, that would be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance. I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a brilliant movie with a lovely storyline,a good cast and fantastic characters.This movie is one of my favourite movies from my childhood,I was looking through some of my old DVD's and when I saw this,I just had to watch it,and it still holds up really well today.I remember when my mom took me to see the Tim Burton remake,it was terrible,it loses all the heart we get in this movie.Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is one of the greatest performances in any family movie ever.Fans of the beloved Roald Dahl children's book and people who enjoy feel good family movies will definitely enjoy this movie very much. When a competition occurs where only five people can win a chance to visit a famous chocolate factory,huge competition begins to win one of the five golden tickets in the chocolate bar.

    Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

    I got to the name of this one because of the remake "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which at the time I thought was an original new movie but turned out to be a boring movie with no soul, great special effects but crude settings and visuals, annoying kids, a creepy Willy Wonka and a ridiculous and unnecessary longer ending. This one, the original, is the "THE" version. Despite some inconsistencies and flaws, at least it's much better made and has soul and authenticity, colorful and extravagant contents, beautiful settings (it takes place in Munich, Germany). Admittedly, there are many similarities between the two versions, yet they're as different as night and day and/or as water and wine. Let's face it, Gene Wilder *IS* Willy Wonka. "His" Willy Wonka is very eccentric without overdoing that nature of his. "Johnny Depp's" Willy Wonka is a creep, a weirdo, like a combination of Michael Jackson and Jos&eacute; Castelo Branco! Plus, Johnny Depp is overrated as an actor. Gene Wilder, now that's real acting! The story is familiar: 5 lucky children live the unique experience of visiting the world's most original,fantastic, wonderful and advanced factory: Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory! The kids are: Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee and Charlie Bucket. Veruca is a most difficult girl. She can really can get on our nerves because she is extremely spoiled and bratty, and way too proud and overly demanding. She is definitely irritating, but her father is to blame either, because he spoils her too much and never denies her anything, which makes her use and abuse of her authority. In fact, she only wins the Golden Ticket by cheating in order to get ahead because her "daddy" allows that. Her "I want this and I want it now" and "I want that and I want it now" and "Nobody denies me anything" attitude is clearly over the top. Despite all, most moments with her are amusing and I like her song "I want it now". Violet, while not as spoiled and bossy, is also annoying, not only because she is a constant gum-chomping but also because of her poor behavior. Augustus Gloop, the fat boy, doesn't annoy me. He even seems like a good boy. His big mistake is that he is gluttonous and he isn't careful on that, which is also a sign of some lack of education. At the same time it proves that he isn't especially smart, the poor devil. Mike Teevee is only slightly annoying when he is introduced to us, and in one of the last scenes he shows up. Other than that, he is generally quiet and polite, just cowboy-obsessed. Charlie Bucket is one of the friendliest and nicest kids that ever graced the screen. He is very nice without being almost too nice as in the remake. The kids are all well portrayed by the actors, especially Peter Ostrum as Charlie (and to think that this was his only film role ever!). Title in Portugal: "A Maravilhosa Hist&oacute;ria de Charlie" (oh, why didn't they just call it "Willy Wonka e a F&aacute;brica de Chocolate"?)

    Gene Wilder turns in a wonderfully eerie performance as our eccentric and knowing host conducting the tour of the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, capturing a quirky but gentle nature all the while serving just deserts! While Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is our poor boy hero who can't carry a tune, his four golden ticket counterparts are sadistically spoiled and comically obnoxious and none better than Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole). We see the brats of the world groomed to be so by discipline-less and over indulgent parents. The psychedelic boat ride and poem was as macabre as they come. This was a movie musical whose purpose was to promote a candy bar and today still holds an enlightening charm without cavities!

    One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.

    This movie is phenomenal on all accounts. I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately. To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?) Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.

    There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence. Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor. This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's. Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite. I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner". "Bull--". "No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet". Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie. So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket. Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

    I got to the name of this one because of the remake "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which at the time I thought was an original new movie but turned out to be a boring movie with no soul, great special effects but crude settings and visuals, annoying kids, a creepy Willy Wonka and a ridiculous and unnecessary longer ending. This one, the original, is the "THE" version. Despite some inconsistencies and flaws, at least it's much better made and has soul and authenticity, colorful and extravagant contents, beautiful settings (it takes place in Munich, Germany). Admittedly, there are many similarities between the two versions, yet they're as different as night and day and/or as water and wine. Let's face it, Gene Wilder *IS* Willy Wonka. "His" Willy Wonka is very eccentric without overdoing that nature of his. "Johnny Depp's" Willy Wonka is a creep, a weirdo, like a combination of Michael Jackson and Jos&eacute; Castelo Branco! Plus, Johnny Depp is overrated as an actor. Gene Wilder, now that's real acting! The story is familiar: 5 lucky children live the unique experience of visiting the world's most original,fantastic, wonderful and advanced factory: Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory! The kids are: Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee and Charlie Bucket. Veruca is a most difficult girl. She can really can get on our nerves because she is extremely spoiled and bratty, and way too proud and overly demanding. She is definitely irritating, but her father is to blame either, because he spoils her too much and never denies her anything, which makes her use and abuse of her authority. In fact, she only wins the Golden Ticket by cheating in order to get ahead because her "daddy" allows that. Her "I want this and I want it now" and "I want that and I want it now" and "Nobody denies me anything" attitude is clearly over the top. Despite all, most moments with her are amusing and I like her song "I want it now". Violet, while not as spoiled and bossy, is also annoying, not only because she is a constant gum-chomping but also because of her poor behavior. Augustus Gloop, the fat boy, doesn't annoy me. He even seems like a good boy. His big mistake is that he is gluttonous and he isn't careful on that, which is also a sign of some lack of education. At the same time it proves that he isn't especially smart, the poor devil. Mike Teevee is only slightly annoying when he is introduced to us, and in one of the last scenes he shows up. Other than that, he is generally quiet and polite, just cowboy-obsessed. Charlie Bucket is one of the friendliest and nicest kids that ever graced the screen. He is very nice without being almost too nice as in the remake. The kids are all well portrayed by the actors, especially Peter Ostrum as Charlie (and to think that this was his only film role ever!). Title in Portugal: "A Maravilhosa Hist&oacute;ria de Charlie" (oh, why didn't they just call it "Willy Wonka e a F&aacute;brica de Chocolate"?)

    Gene Wilder turns in a wonderfully eerie performance as our eccentric and knowing host conducting the tour of the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, capturing a quirky but gentle nature all the while serving just deserts! While Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is our poor boy hero who can't carry a tune, his four golden ticket counterparts are sadistically spoiled and comically obnoxious and none better than Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole). We see the brats of the world groomed to be so by discipline-less and over indulgent parents. The psychedelic boat ride and poem was as macabre as they come. This was a movie musical whose purpose was to promote a candy bar and today still holds an enlightening charm without cavities!

    One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.

    This movie is phenomenal on all accounts. I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately. To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?) Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.

    There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence. Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor. This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's. Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite. I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner". "Bull--". "No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet". Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie. So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket. Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

    Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.

    "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" has always been one of my favorite readings. I Discovered Roald Dahl's classic in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether for the Wonka bars or other candies, the story always gave me to eat chocolate. Another aspect of the novel grabbed my attention: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built following the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light, which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones, with the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments. As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book, finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and natural appeal for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid, who sets a positive example, to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character ever, although the two films didn't exactly give much depth and substance to the titular hero. Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka, rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, with all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film, to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct. But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, but they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "The Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's, the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man" Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book. Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression, that would be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance. I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Gene Wilder turns in a wonderfully eerie performance as our eccentric and knowing host conducting the tour of the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, capturing a quirky but gentle nature all the while serving just deserts! While Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is our poor boy hero who can't carry a tune, his four golden ticket counterparts are sadistically spoiled and comically obnoxious and none better than Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole). We see the brats of the world groomed to be so by discipline-less and over indulgent parents. The psychedelic boat ride and poem was as macabre as they come. This was a movie musical whose purpose was to promote a candy bar and today still holds an enlightening charm without cavities!

    One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.

    This movie is phenomenal on all accounts. I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately. To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?) Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.

    There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence. Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor. This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's. Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite. I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner". "Bull--". "No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet". Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie. So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket. Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod. So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless. P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.

    Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.

    "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" has always been one of my favorite readings. I Discovered Roald Dahl's classic in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether for the Wonka bars or other candies, the story always gave me to eat chocolate. Another aspect of the novel grabbed my attention: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built following the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light, which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones, with the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments. As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book, finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and natural appeal for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid, who sets a positive example, to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character ever, although the two films didn't exactly give much depth and substance to the titular hero. Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka, rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, with all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film, to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct. But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, but they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "The Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's, the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man" Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book. Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression, that would be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance. I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was mixed regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults. Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Naturally, I still prefer the book.

    Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a brilliant movie with a lovely storyline,a good cast and fantastic characters.This movie is one of my favourite movies from my childhood,I was looking through some of my old DVD's and when I saw this,I just had to watch it,and it still holds up really well today.I remember when my mom took me to see the Tim Burton remake,it was terrible,it loses all the heart we get in this movie.Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is one of the greatest performances in any family movie ever.Fans of the beloved Roald Dahl children's book and people who enjoy feel good family movies will definitely enjoy this movie very much. When a competition occurs where only five people can win a chance to visit a famous chocolate factory,huge competition begins to win one of the five golden tickets in the chocolate bar.

    Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster

    I got to the name of this one because of the remake "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which at the time I thought was an original new movie but turned out to be a boring movie with no soul, great special effects but crude settings and visuals, annoying kids, a creepy Willy Wonka and a ridiculous and unnecessary longer ending. This one, the original, is the "THE" version. Despite some inconsistencies and flaws, at least it's much better made and has soul and authenticity, colorful and extravagant contents, beautiful settings (it takes place in Munich, Germany). Admittedly, there are many similarities between the two versions, yet they're as different as night and day and/or as water and wine. Let's face it, Gene Wilder *IS* Willy Wonka. "His" Willy Wonka is very eccentric without overdoing that nature of his. "Johnny Depp's" Willy Wonka is a creep, a weirdo, like a combination of Michael Jackson and Jos&eacute; Castelo Branco! Plus, Johnny Depp is overrated as an actor. Gene Wilder, now that's real acting! The story is familiar: 5 lucky children live the unique experience of visiting the world's most original,fantastic, wonderful and advanced factory: Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory! The kids are: Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee and Charlie Bucket. Veruca is a most difficult girl. She can really can get on our nerves because she is extremely spoiled and bratty, and way too proud and overly demanding. She is definitely irritating, but her father is to blame either, because he spoils her too much and never denies her anything, which makes her use and abuse of her authority. In fact, she only wins the Golden Ticket by cheating in order to get ahead because her "daddy" allows that. Her "I want this and I want it now" and "I want that and I want it now" and "Nobody denies me anything" attitude is clearly over the top. Despite all, most moments with her are amusing and I like her song "I want it now". Violet, while not as spoiled and bossy, is also annoying, not only because she is a constant gum-chomping but also because of her poor behavior. Augustus Gloop, the fat boy, doesn't annoy me. He even seems like a good boy. His big mistake is that he is gluttonous and he isn't careful on that, which is also a sign of some lack of education. At the same time it proves that he isn't especially smart, the poor devil. Mike Teevee is only slightly annoying when he is introduced to us, and in one of the last scenes he shows up. Other than that, he is generally quiet and polite, just cowboy-obsessed. Charlie Bucket is one of the friendliest and nicest kids that ever graced the screen. He is very nice without being almost too nice as in the remake. The kids are all well portrayed by the actors, especially Peter Ostrum as Charlie (and to think that this was his only film role ever!). Title in Portugal: "A Maravilhosa Hist&oacute;ria de Charlie" (oh, why didn't they just call it "Willy Wonka e a F&aacute;brica de Chocolate"?)
