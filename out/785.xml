 <storyline>
  Destiny. Faith (Marisa Tomei) believes that two soul-mates can be united if they find each other. From the Ouija board, she has found the name of her missing half, and it is D-A-M-O-N B-R-A-D-L-E-Y. Later, at the carnival, the fortune teller sees the name Damon Bradley in the Crystal Ball and Faith is convinced. She is told that "You make your own destiny,...don't wait for it to come to you", but she is looking for Damon. 14 years later, she is engaged to a dull podiatrist and plans to marry until she gets a call from one of his classmates who is on his way to Venice, Italy. The classmate is Damon Bradley. Rushing to the airport to see her soul-mate, she misses him and the plane, but decides, then and there, to go after him. So Faith and her sister-in-law Kate both board the next plane for Italy hoping to find her Damon.

    The movie about a young schoolteacher Faith (Marisa Tomei) obsessed with her "soul mate" after year ago as child used Ouja board she and her brother used and the name come up Damon Bradley. Now about to married to a foot doctor, she receives a call by one of her fianc&eacute;'s friend to wishes them luck but his name turned to be Damon Bradley. So Faith becomes a runaway bride and goes with her friend (Bonnie Hunt) to travel to Venice, Italy to meet Mr. Right. But then she run over a shoe salesman (Robert Downey Jr.) and he fall for her. The entire movie is stupid and a waste of time, Faith is stupid; she run-off to find her "soul mate" that she doesn't know and obsessed with it since she was a kid (he probably don't like her and Bonnie Hunt's character is right she need to see psychiatrist) this were for real her fianc&eacute; would go after (what she didn't wad that her brother paid the fortune teller and moved the board the entire time when they were kids). Robert Downey Jr.'s character fall in love with Faith so quickly and neither of them harder know each other (both them are silly anyway). Bonnie Hunt's character is the only one with any sense. At the end of the movie it turn out the real "Damon Bradley" is older man and stupid-looking. I heard some comment that is this for real Downey Jr.'s character wouldn't want her anymore at the end, she treated him like dirt and he tried to help her entire time. I wish they would making next time as vacation movie (Monte Carlo).

    It would be easy to say that this is Marisa Tomei's film, but Robert Downey, Jr. -- particularly during this part of his career -- was a particularly charismatic actor. And, Downey doesn't even come into the film until it is 1/3 over! But, then, to an extent, he dominates the film. Tomei has had a relatively successful career since making this film, but not as successful as I would have predicted, because she is delightful here. And Downey has had a successful film career since his "recovery", but he has never been able to play the somewhat innocent love interest since his problems. And that's unfortunate, because as this film (and "Chances Are") proved...nobody was better at least in this generation of actors (Cary Grant mastered it decades before). The movie is clearly a woman's film, but I still liked it. The plot is clever, with a couple of nice twists, and the theme of destiny is always an interesting one. Bonnie Hunt is charming as the "best friend". If you like romantic films or light comedies, then this is for you. Highly recommended.

    I can and do watch it over and over again: no violence, brutality, dark images or ugliness; all smiles, fun and beautiful locations with beautiful people in beautiful outfits. Locations themselves are worth watching it for, not to mention the acting which is brilliant. Tomei and Dawney seem such a wonderfully matching couple, you can easily believe they are a couple in real life. Bonnie Hunt is so beautiful, so natural, so perfect for this role. Loved the whole movie from start to finish, there are no slack moments, you must watch it or loose the thread. What is more, the story line is believable - well almost, apart from bits here and there, such as you can not just change flights at moment's notice and it seems the action takes place over not just 48 hours but at least five days or more! Recommend it heartily - and wish there were more movies like this and much less the "other" kind that are full of dark scenes, killing, gore and brutality.

    From director Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, The Thomas Crown Affair, Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck), I spotted this pretty much out of nowhere and noticed the two leading stars, so I just to give it a try. Basically when she was a child Faith Corvatch (Marisa Tomei) used a Ouija Board that spelled out, in individual letters, the name "Damon Bradley", and this is supposedly the name of her soul mate. Now grown up she goes to a carnival and has a fortune teller using her Crystal Ball sees this name as well as the man she will marry, and then, on the verge of getting married, she overhears a phone call from her future husband's friend, it is Damon Bradley calling from Venice, Italy. Faith is determined to track him down, so she and her sister in law Kate (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) travel from New York to the Italian countryside and streets of Rome in search of the man they only know by name. They are following his trail with any information people can give from his last known whereabouts, but they seem to keep missing him by small amounts of time, even once by seconds and inches. Then Faith meets a young American man (Robert Downey Jr.), but has no interest in him until he hears the name and identifies himself as Damon Bradley, and after a spending a night together they have both fallen hopelessly in love. It only falls apart when he confesses that he is not Damon Bradley, his real name is Peter Wright, and she angrily walks out wanting to go home, but Kate finding attraction for her from Giovanni (Joaquim De Almeida) the Italian businessman might make that difficult. Peter comes back to her though and says that he has been looking for a Damon Bradley, and found out he has apparently moved to Positano, so Giovanni drives Peter, Faith and Kate there to find her at a posh hotel. Then they find this "Damon Bradley" (Billy Zane), a playboy with long hair and many women lapping him up, and confident she should try and see how things go she invites him to go. Of course it turns out this "Damon" is actually Peter's friend Harry and the whole thing was staged, and meanwhile Kate's husband Larry (Fisher Stevens) has travelled to find them and make up with his wife, but they planned to come home now anyway. Larry reveals to Faith that when he did the Ouiji board as a child and spelled the name out, it was all a prank, and he paid the fortune teller too, he didn't tell her because he was worried she would never talk to him again. Getting to the airport Peter is there to see off Faith, and they both overhear a real Damon Bradley (Adam LeFevre) at the information desk, so they can truly meet him, he is a reasonably good looking man, Peter explains the whole situation to him and he is perplexed, and of course he mentions being in love with her. In the end this Damon asks Faith if she loves Peter, and that if she truly does then she should embrace it, and she manages to catch him on his plane to Boston in time, and they kiss, with all the other passengers applauding, and they fly off into the sunset. Also starring John Benjamin Hickey as Dwayne and Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Leslie. Tomei is obviously attractive and she is also charming as the woman searching for the supposed man she has a destiny with, and Downey Jr. is likable as the man she actually should be with, their scenes together are great, and the supporting cast, including sleazy Zane works well too, I can see what the critics mean by a Cinderella style story, it certainly has that quality, and it makes you laugh in the right places, a good fun romantic comedy. Very good!

    This movie is so cute and so endearing, that I find it possible to watch frequently and still love it. Robert Downey Jr. is damn sexy to boot! The main character has it set in her mind from various childhood experiences with the supernatural that she is destined to be with one particular man, a Damon Bradley. But as she matures she "settles" for a foot doctor and they become engaged. Then one day, when a friend of her fianc&eacute;'s calls, she gets his number and his name, Damon Bradley. Then the search takes them to Italy to find her soulmate! She is a wacky individual who thinks she knows what is best and doesn't want any regrets, so I find her believable. Her silly best friend is Bonnie Hunt and she is hilarious. This is reminiscent of romantic movies of old, and has enough twists to keep you interested through the movie, as well as their romantic tension. I love this movie, and have loved it for years. Great for teens, which is when I found this movie, but I still love it.

    "Only You" is an immodest, sweet confection, a romantic comedy from one end to the other that doesn't have much meat on it but is the kind of movie that you cozy up with with cup of hot chocolate. It is slightly better than I might have expected and that's probably due to the talent involved. The movie stars Marisa Tomei, probably the only actress who could have made this material believable. She has the effect of being cute without being cutesy. She plays the appropriately named Faith who, since childhood, has believed that her entire destiny is leading her to be with a man named Damon Bradley. She is told by a fortune teller at the age of 11 that she and Bradley are destined to be together. She has no idea who this man is, but stands hard and fast to the information that their bond is written in the stars. Years later, now in her 20s, she has given up on Damon Bradley and is about to marry a podiatrist. On her wedding day, she receives a phone call from a friend of her husband-to-be saying that he cannot attend. His name . . . Damon Bradley, and he's on his way to Rome. Without a second thought, Faith and her sister-in-law Kate (played by the invaluable Bonnie Hunt) jump on a plane and go after him. Faith and Kate run around Venice like maniacs trying to track down Damon Bradley and when they find him, he turns out to be exactly what Faith had hoped he would be. He is handsome, dark-haired, charming and looks exactly like Robert Downey Jr. Who wouldn't swoon? The two embark on a sweet tour of Rome, very much in the same vein that Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck did in Roman Holiday. In fact, one of their stops is Pavonazzetto marble monument of The Mouth of Truth which was most famously seen in that 1953 classic. Yet, it wouldn't be romantic comedy if they simply fell in love. A complication arises with the validity of whether or not Downey actually is Damon Bradley. That sets the whole movie off on a wacky romp through the countryside as he tries to prove to her that he really is in love with her, despite the validity of his claim. This is all not to be believed. Only You is the kind of happy romantic comedy of a bygone era, before cynicism became an insurance policy. This is a movie that believes in destiny and fate and love at first sight and it is played through a cast of actors who are smart enough and convincing enough to pull it off. What distinguishes this movie above most is that it is always just a notch better than it should be. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. are beautiful people but they are such good actors that they are able to sell this story with a convincing charm. Tomei, with her wide-eyes, and pouty lips is able to push through this confection and make you believe that she really does believe everything that she is saying. Downey too is excellent, giving us a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. He loves this woman and he is willing to do what it takes to be with her. They're good together, even when the script tips in the direction of being too unbelievable for its own good. Both Downey and Tomei are wonderful, but for my money, the real gem of this movie is the supporting performance of Bonnie Hunt, as Faith's eternally-loyal sister-in-law. She always stands just to the side of Tomei and brings the movie an unexpected, and very funny, extra joy. Her comic timing is flawless. She has a manner of giving us funny asides that are delivered with just the right precision like: "I married a liar. Why? Because I married a man." I love that line and her comment when she and Faith are dismayed by an awful wedding dress that had been handed down, she says "If I had a dress like that, I'd give it away too."Kate has her own problems back home with an uncaring husband (Fisher Stevens) how has long ago abandoned love for a union that doesn't stretch beyond "Where's dinner?" She's a portrait of what happens to a marriage long after the ceremony when two people have settled into a relentless pattern of misunderstanding. Yet, what comes of their relationship completely took me by surprise. "Only You" was directed by Norman Jewison, the man who directed "Fiddler on the Roof", "In the Heat of the Night" and the one of the best romantic comedies of all time "Moonstruck". He doesn't succeed as well this time. This movie often feels like a nice day off, something he made as a lark. The movie is like cotton candy, all about romance and love and destiny shot against the background of one of the most beautiful locations on earth. There's nothing really wrong with that, it is probably better than it should be, given the creative talents but it won't leave you with much to think about.

    I was pleasantly surprised by this film. There are comparisons to "Roman Holiday," sure, and not without reason. And yes, the plot stretches the limits of credibility. And there are some plot holes big enough to steer a gondola through. But forget all of that. Every once in a while you need a sweet, fun romantic comedy, and this is one of them. But it isn't the top billed stars, Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, or even the Italian scenery, that make this film worth watching. The real scene stealer, and the best reason to watch "Only You," is the wonderful, and woefully under-appreciated, Bonnie Hunt. She shines in what in lesser hands would have been a throwaway role as the "understanding sister-in-law/best friend/voice of reason" (the kind of role that the major studios keep handing her). She steals practically every film she's in without even trying to. Now that takes real talent, and Miss Hunt has it. (And I defy anybody to see her in another film that doesn't get talked about much lately, "Loggerheads," where she turned in an incredibly moving dramatic performance, and not be affected by her. One of these days, she's going to get another role that will really let her shine.) So do yourself a favor. Get this DVD, a bottle of Chianti, and see this with someone you love, or would like to. And then watch it again, just to see why Bonnie Hunt's name should have received top billing. You won't regret it.

    I am a fan of the romantic comedy genre, not because every one of them is great (because probably a majority are not) but because when I find one that I like, I am more satisfied that I would be with almost any other genre. "Only You" is a great romantic comedy. I recognize that there are a ton of things about the plot and some of the characters that I could nit-pick, but so few of these films are well done and have enough emotion to leave me satisfied and happy that I see no point in complaining. The film basically involves Marisa Tomei being led to believe from her teenage years than her destined lover is a man named Damon Bradley, and when she is engaged to another man, she receives a call from her fianc&eacute;'s high school alum with the same name. Convinced he's the man, she flies to Italy to meet him and instead meets Robert Downey Jr, who has immediately fallen in love with Tomei and claims himself to be Bradley. Naturally, not a perfect film, and plenty of minor flaws, but I must say that this one was less predictable than the average film of it's type. It's mildly funny, and most importantly, it has, in my opinion, a perfect ending, the most important element of a romantic comedy for me. Beautifully scenic, mostly being shot in Italy. I'm not claiming the film to be flawless, but see it without super high expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. This film reminds me of watching a movie simply for enjoying it rather than criticizing it. ***1/2 out of ****

    'Only You' is the type of movie that makes anyone with a Y chromosome shudder in bewilderment. It embodies everything that romance-craving women want from a movie, and nothing a thoughtful viewer does. Marissa Tomei is told as a child that she will marry someone named Damon Bradley, and as an adult (I use the word generously) she decides to fly to Italy with one hours notice in pursuit of a stranger with that name. The crew at the airport accepts her idiotic reasoning for reopening the flight she missed ("The man I'll marry is on that plane." ?) and off she goes to Italy. When a man does this it's called 'stalking' or 'a security situation.' In the movie's grotesquely stereotypical idea of Italy, she improbably locates Damon after being completely boorish with a hotel clerk. The hotel clerk, who's old enough to give this girl an earful, instead instantly becomes cooperative, because he has no life, pride, story or values of his own. Bad writing is like that. Oh and her sister comes along too. I can only recount that much of the plot because this was so phenomenally stupid after 40 minutes that my attention drifted. Most people, I find, appreciate 'common sense' both in life and in movies. Nothing in this remotely resembles life as you know it. For the length of the movie, Tomei and Hunt sit in judgment of men and their perceived failings, without ever once acknowledging Tomei is at best a complete flake, and at worst... a fickle, developmentally-delayed lunatic. In the end, after a similar plane-boarding crisis is overcome and true love bursts out on the plane, a crowd of Italian airport personnel stands on the tarmac waving bye-bye (to a jumbo-jet?). When one thinks of the painstaking care and artistry on display in old film noirs, this movie looks like garbage.

    ...yes, why can't I just take it for what it is? A flimcy-flumcy childish fairytale on hallucinogenics?? Why??? I'll tell You why; it's a complete waste of location(Rome, Italy), talent(Tomei, probably director too), genre(romance) and my time. Not at any time, the director pays any respect to.... -anything. The stressed pace of action, lack of development of character, Rome set as a stereotypic background prop for romance(I love Rome) etc. etc. etc. Stereotypic 19.th century sexual roles without any hint of either adult love affair or sexual attraction. Just a predictable mass Hollywood production. Why does Tomei even consider playing any part of this? (I couldn't watch till the end just utterly crap crap crap- sorry(not)). Watch some Jane Austen(1995 Pride & Prejustice) or just Casablanca, and You'll lose the bad taste of.... crap in your mouth(sorry again). 100% disappointed

    This movie is so cute and so endearing, that I find it possible to watch frequently and still love it. Robert Downey Jr. is damn sexy to boot! The main character has it set in her mind from various childhood experiences with the supernatural that she is destined to be with one particular man, a Damon Bradley. But as she matures she "settles" for a foot doctor and they become engaged. Then one day, when a friend of her fianc&eacute;'s calls, she gets his number and his name, Damon Bradley. Then the search takes them to Italy to find her soulmate! She is a wacky individual who thinks she knows what is best and doesn't want any regrets, so I find her believable. Her silly best friend is Bonnie Hunt and she is hilarious. This is reminiscent of romantic movies of old, and has enough twists to keep you interested through the movie, as well as their romantic tension. I love this movie, and have loved it for years. Great for teens, which is when I found this movie, but I still love it.

    "Only You" is an immodest, sweet confection, a romantic comedy from one end to the other that doesn't have much meat on it but is the kind of movie that you cozy up with with cup of hot chocolate. It is slightly better than I might have expected and that's probably due to the talent involved. The movie stars Marisa Tomei, probably the only actress who could have made this material believable. She has the effect of being cute without being cutesy. She plays the appropriately named Faith who, since childhood, has believed that her entire destiny is leading her to be with a man named Damon Bradley. She is told by a fortune teller at the age of 11 that she and Bradley are destined to be together. She has no idea who this man is, but stands hard and fast to the information that their bond is written in the stars. Years later, now in her 20s, she has given up on Damon Bradley and is about to marry a podiatrist. On her wedding day, she receives a phone call from a friend of her husband-to-be saying that he cannot attend. His name . . . Damon Bradley, and he's on his way to Rome. Without a second thought, Faith and her sister-in-law Kate (played by the invaluable Bonnie Hunt) jump on a plane and go after him. Faith and Kate run around Venice like maniacs trying to track down Damon Bradley and when they find him, he turns out to be exactly what Faith had hoped he would be. He is handsome, dark-haired, charming and looks exactly like Robert Downey Jr. Who wouldn't swoon? The two embark on a sweet tour of Rome, very much in the same vein that Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck did in Roman Holiday. In fact, one of their stops is Pavonazzetto marble monument of The Mouth of Truth which was most famously seen in that 1953 classic. Yet, it wouldn't be romantic comedy if they simply fell in love. A complication arises with the validity of whether or not Downey actually is Damon Bradley. That sets the whole movie off on a wacky romp through the countryside as he tries to prove to her that he really is in love with her, despite the validity of his claim. This is all not to be believed. Only You is the kind of happy romantic comedy of a bygone era, before cynicism became an insurance policy. This is a movie that believes in destiny and fate and love at first sight and it is played through a cast of actors who are smart enough and convincing enough to pull it off. What distinguishes this movie above most is that it is always just a notch better than it should be. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. are beautiful people but they are such good actors that they are able to sell this story with a convincing charm. Tomei, with her wide-eyes, and pouty lips is able to push through this confection and make you believe that she really does believe everything that she is saying. Downey too is excellent, giving us a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. He loves this woman and he is willing to do what it takes to be with her. They're good together, even when the script tips in the direction of being too unbelievable for its own good. Both Downey and Tomei are wonderful, but for my money, the real gem of this movie is the supporting performance of Bonnie Hunt, as Faith's eternally-loyal sister-in-law. She always stands just to the side of Tomei and brings the movie an unexpected, and very funny, extra joy. Her comic timing is flawless. She has a manner of giving us funny asides that are delivered with just the right precision like: "I married a liar. Why? Because I married a man." I love that line and her comment when she and Faith are dismayed by an awful wedding dress that had been handed down, she says "If I had a dress like that, I'd give it away too."Kate has her own problems back home with an uncaring husband (Fisher Stevens) how has long ago abandoned love for a union that doesn't stretch beyond "Where's dinner?" She's a portrait of what happens to a marriage long after the ceremony when two people have settled into a relentless pattern of misunderstanding. Yet, what comes of their relationship completely took me by surprise. "Only You" was directed by Norman Jewison, the man who directed "Fiddler on the Roof", "In the Heat of the Night" and the one of the best romantic comedies of all time "Moonstruck". He doesn't succeed as well this time. This movie often feels like a nice day off, something he made as a lark. The movie is like cotton candy, all about romance and love and destiny shot against the background of one of the most beautiful locations on earth. There's nothing really wrong with that, it is probably better than it should be, given the creative talents but it won't leave you with much to think about.

    I was pleasantly surprised by this film. There are comparisons to "Roman Holiday," sure, and not without reason. And yes, the plot stretches the limits of credibility. And there are some plot holes big enough to steer a gondola through. But forget all of that. Every once in a while you need a sweet, fun romantic comedy, and this is one of them. But it isn't the top billed stars, Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, or even the Italian scenery, that make this film worth watching. The real scene stealer, and the best reason to watch "Only You," is the wonderful, and woefully under-appreciated, Bonnie Hunt. She shines in what in lesser hands would have been a throwaway role as the "understanding sister-in-law/best friend/voice of reason" (the kind of role that the major studios keep handing her). She steals practically every film she's in without even trying to. Now that takes real talent, and Miss Hunt has it. (And I defy anybody to see her in another film that doesn't get talked about much lately, "Loggerheads," where she turned in an incredibly moving dramatic performance, and not be affected by her. One of these days, she's going to get another role that will really let her shine.) So do yourself a favor. Get this DVD, a bottle of Chianti, and see this with someone you love, or would like to. And then watch it again, just to see why Bonnie Hunt's name should have received top billing. You won't regret it.

    I am a fan of the romantic comedy genre, not because every one of them is great (because probably a majority are not) but because when I find one that I like, I am more satisfied that I would be with almost any other genre. "Only You" is a great romantic comedy. I recognize that there are a ton of things about the plot and some of the characters that I could nit-pick, but so few of these films are well done and have enough emotion to leave me satisfied and happy that I see no point in complaining. The film basically involves Marisa Tomei being led to believe from her teenage years than her destined lover is a man named Damon Bradley, and when she is engaged to another man, she receives a call from her fianc&eacute;'s high school alum with the same name. Convinced he's the man, she flies to Italy to meet him and instead meets Robert Downey Jr, who has immediately fallen in love with Tomei and claims himself to be Bradley. Naturally, not a perfect film, and plenty of minor flaws, but I must say that this one was less predictable than the average film of it's type. It's mildly funny, and most importantly, it has, in my opinion, a perfect ending, the most important element of a romantic comedy for me. Beautifully scenic, mostly being shot in Italy. I'm not claiming the film to be flawless, but see it without super high expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. This film reminds me of watching a movie simply for enjoying it rather than criticizing it. ***1/2 out of ****

    'Only You' is the type of movie that makes anyone with a Y chromosome shudder in bewilderment. It embodies everything that romance-craving women want from a movie, and nothing a thoughtful viewer does. Marissa Tomei is told as a child that she will marry someone named Damon Bradley, and as an adult (I use the word generously) she decides to fly to Italy with one hours notice in pursuit of a stranger with that name. The crew at the airport accepts her idiotic reasoning for reopening the flight she missed ("The man I'll marry is on that plane." ?) and off she goes to Italy. When a man does this it's called 'stalking' or 'a security situation.' In the movie's grotesquely stereotypical idea of Italy, she improbably locates Damon after being completely boorish with a hotel clerk. The hotel clerk, who's old enough to give this girl an earful, instead instantly becomes cooperative, because he has no life, pride, story or values of his own. Bad writing is like that. Oh and her sister comes along too. I can only recount that much of the plot because this was so phenomenally stupid after 40 minutes that my attention drifted. Most people, I find, appreciate 'common sense' both in life and in movies. Nothing in this remotely resembles life as you know it. For the length of the movie, Tomei and Hunt sit in judgment of men and their perceived failings, without ever once acknowledging Tomei is at best a complete flake, and at worst... a fickle, developmentally-delayed lunatic. In the end, after a similar plane-boarding crisis is overcome and true love bursts out on the plane, a crowd of Italian airport personnel stands on the tarmac waving bye-bye (to a jumbo-jet?). When one thinks of the painstaking care and artistry on display in old film noirs, this movie looks like garbage.

    ...yes, why can't I just take it for what it is? A flimcy-flumcy childish fairytale on hallucinogenics?? Why??? I'll tell You why; it's a complete waste of location(Rome, Italy), talent(Tomei, probably director too), genre(romance) and my time. Not at any time, the director pays any respect to.... -anything. The stressed pace of action, lack of development of character, Rome set as a stereotypic background prop for romance(I love Rome) etc. etc. etc. Stereotypic 19.th century sexual roles without any hint of either adult love affair or sexual attraction. Just a predictable mass Hollywood production. Why does Tomei even consider playing any part of this? (I couldn't watch till the end just utterly crap crap crap- sorry(not)). Watch some Jane Austen(1995 Pride & Prejustice) or just Casablanca, and You'll lose the bad taste of.... crap in your mouth(sorry again). 100% disappointed

    The movie about a young schoolteacher Faith (Marisa Tomei) obsessed with her "soul mate" after year ago as child used Ouja board she and her brother used and the name come up Damon Bradley. Now about to married to a foot doctor, she receives a call by one of her fianc&eacute;'s friend to wishes them luck but his name turned to be Damon Bradley. So Faith becomes a runaway bride and goes with her friend (Bonnie Hunt) to travel to Venice, Italy to meet Mr. Right. But then she run over a shoe salesman (Robert Downey Jr.) and he fall for her. The entire movie is stupid and a waste of time, Faith is stupid; she run-off to find her "soul mate" that she doesn't know and obsessed with it since she was a kid (he probably don't like her and Bonnie Hunt's character is right she need to see psychiatrist) this were for real her fianc&eacute; would go after (what she didn't wad that her brother paid the fortune teller and moved the board the entire time when they were kids). Robert Downey Jr.'s character fall in love with Faith so quickly and neither of them harder know each other (both them are silly anyway). Bonnie Hunt's character is the only one with any sense. At the end of the movie it turn out the real "Damon Bradley" is older man and stupid-looking. I heard some comment that is this for real Downey Jr.'s character wouldn't want her anymore at the end, she treated him like dirt and he tried to help her entire time. I wish they would making next time as vacation movie (Monte Carlo).

    It would be easy to say that this is Marisa Tomei's film, but Robert Downey, Jr. -- particularly during this part of his career -- was a particularly charismatic actor. And, Downey doesn't even come into the film until it is 1/3 over! But, then, to an extent, he dominates the film. Tomei has had a relatively successful career since making this film, but not as successful as I would have predicted, because she is delightful here. And Downey has had a successful film career since his "recovery", but he has never been able to play the somewhat innocent love interest since his problems. And that's unfortunate, because as this film (and "Chances Are") proved...nobody was better at least in this generation of actors (Cary Grant mastered it decades before). The movie is clearly a woman's film, but I still liked it. The plot is clever, with a couple of nice twists, and the theme of destiny is always an interesting one. Bonnie Hunt is charming as the "best friend". If you like romantic films or light comedies, then this is for you. Highly recommended.

    I can and do watch it over and over again: no violence, brutality, dark images or ugliness; all smiles, fun and beautiful locations with beautiful people in beautiful outfits. Locations themselves are worth watching it for, not to mention the acting which is brilliant. Tomei and Dawney seem such a wonderfully matching couple, you can easily believe they are a couple in real life. Bonnie Hunt is so beautiful, so natural, so perfect for this role. Loved the whole movie from start to finish, there are no slack moments, you must watch it or loose the thread. What is more, the story line is believable - well almost, apart from bits here and there, such as you can not just change flights at moment's notice and it seems the action takes place over not just 48 hours but at least five days or more! Recommend it heartily - and wish there were more movies like this and much less the "other" kind that are full of dark scenes, killing, gore and brutality.

    From director Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, The Thomas Crown Affair, Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck), I spotted this pretty much out of nowhere and noticed the two leading stars, so I just to give it a try. Basically when she was a child Faith Corvatch (Marisa Tomei) used a Ouija Board that spelled out, in individual letters, the name "Damon Bradley", and this is supposedly the name of her soul mate. Now grown up she goes to a carnival and has a fortune teller using her Crystal Ball sees this name as well as the man she will marry, and then, on the verge of getting married, she overhears a phone call from her future husband's friend, it is Damon Bradley calling from Venice, Italy. Faith is determined to track him down, so she and her sister in law Kate (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) travel from New York to the Italian countryside and streets of Rome in search of the man they only know by name. They are following his trail with any information people can give from his last known whereabouts, but they seem to keep missing him by small amounts of time, even once by seconds and inches. Then Faith meets a young American man (Robert Downey Jr.), but has no interest in him until he hears the name and identifies himself as Damon Bradley, and after a spending a night together they have both fallen hopelessly in love. It only falls apart when he confesses that he is not Damon Bradley, his real name is Peter Wright, and she angrily walks out wanting to go home, but Kate finding attraction for her from Giovanni (Joaquim De Almeida) the Italian businessman might make that difficult. Peter comes back to her though and says that he has been looking for a Damon Bradley, and found out he has apparently moved to Positano, so Giovanni drives Peter, Faith and Kate there to find her at a posh hotel. Then they find this "Damon Bradley" (Billy Zane), a playboy with long hair and many women lapping him up, and confident she should try and see how things go she invites him to go. Of course it turns out this "Damon" is actually Peter's friend Harry and the whole thing was staged, and meanwhile Kate's husband Larry (Fisher Stevens) has travelled to find them and make up with his wife, but they planned to come home now anyway. Larry reveals to Faith that when he did the Ouiji board as a child and spelled the name out, it was all a prank, and he paid the fortune teller too, he didn't tell her because he was worried she would never talk to him again. Getting to the airport Peter is there to see off Faith, and they both overhear a real Damon Bradley (Adam LeFevre) at the information desk, so they can truly meet him, he is a reasonably good looking man, Peter explains the whole situation to him and he is perplexed, and of course he mentions being in love with her. In the end this Damon asks Faith if she loves Peter, and that if she truly does then she should embrace it, and she manages to catch him on his plane to Boston in time, and they kiss, with all the other passengers applauding, and they fly off into the sunset. Also starring John Benjamin Hickey as Dwayne and Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Leslie. Tomei is obviously attractive and she is also charming as the woman searching for the supposed man she has a destiny with, and Downey Jr. is likable as the man she actually should be with, their scenes together are great, and the supporting cast, including sleazy Zane works well too, I can see what the critics mean by a Cinderella style story, it certainly has that quality, and it makes you laugh in the right places, a good fun romantic comedy. Very good!

For the length of the movie, Tomei and Hunt sit in judgment of men and their perceived failings, without ever once acknowledging Tomei is at best a complete flake, and at worst... a fickle, developmentally-delayed lunatic. In the end, after a similar plane-boarding crisis is overcome and true love bursts out on the plane, a crowd of Italian airport personnel stands on the tarmac waving bye-bye (to a jumbo-jet?). When one thinks of the painstaking care and artistry on display in old film noirs, this movie looks like garbage.

    ...yes, why can't I just take it for what it is? A flimcy-flumcy childish fairytale on hallucinogenics?? Why??? I'll tell You why; it's a complete waste of location(Rome, Italy), talent(Tomei, probably director too), genre(romance) and my time. Not at any time, the director pays any respect to.... -anything. The stressed pace of action, lack of development of character, Rome set as a stereotypic background prop for romance(I love Rome) etc. etc. etc. Stereotypic 19.th century sexual roles without any hint of either adult love affair or sexual attraction. Just a predictable mass Hollywood production. Why does Tomei even consider playing any part of this? (I couldn't watch till the end just utterly crap crap crap- sorry(not)). Watch some Jane Austen(1995 Pride & Prejustice) or just Casablanca, and You'll lose the bad taste of.... crap in your mouth(sorry again). 100% disappointed

    The movie about a young schoolteacher Faith (Marisa Tomei) obsessed with her "soul mate" after year ago as child used Ouja board she and her brother used and the name come up Damon Bradley. Now about to married to a foot doctor, she receives a call by one of her fianc&eacute;'s friend to wishes them luck but his name turned to be Damon Bradley. So Faith becomes a runaway bride and goes with her friend (Bonnie Hunt) to travel to Venice, Italy to meet Mr. Right. But then she run over a shoe salesman (Robert Downey Jr.) and he fall for her. The entire movie is stupid and a waste of time, Faith is stupid; she run-off to find her "soul mate" that she doesn't know and obsessed with it since she was a kid (he probably don't like her and Bonnie Hunt's character is right she need to see psychiatrist) this were for real her fianc&eacute; would go after (what she didn't wad that her brother paid the fortune teller and moved the board the entire time when they were kids). Robert Downey Jr.'s character fall in love with Faith so quickly and neither of them harder know each other (both them are silly anyway). Bonnie Hunt's character is the only one with any sense. At the end of the movie it turn out the real "Damon Bradley" is older man and stupid-looking. I heard some comment that is this for real Downey Jr.'s character wouldn't want her anymore at the end, she treated him like dirt and he tried to help her entire time. I wish they would making next time as vacation movie (Monte Carlo).

    It would be easy to say that this is Marisa Tomei's film, but Robert Downey, Jr. -- particularly during this part of his career -- was a particularly charismatic actor. And, Downey doesn't even come into the film until it is 1/3 over! But, then, to an extent, he dominates the film. Tomei has had a relatively successful career since making this film, but not as successful as I would have predicted, because she is delightful here. And Downey has had a successful film career since his "recovery", but he has never been able to play the somewhat innocent love interest since his problems. And that's unfortunate, because as this film (and "Chances Are") proved...nobody was better at least in this generation of actors (Cary Grant mastered it decades before). The movie is clearly a woman's film, but I still liked it. The plot is clever, with a couple of nice twists, and the theme of destiny is always an interesting one. Bonnie Hunt is charming as the "best friend". If you like romantic films or light comedies, then this is for you. Highly recommended.

    I can and do watch it over and over again: no violence, brutality, dark images or ugliness; all smiles, fun and beautiful locations with beautiful people in beautiful outfits. Locations themselves are worth watching it for, not to mention the acting which is brilliant. Tomei and Dawney seem such a wonderfully matching couple, you can easily believe they are a couple in real life. Bonnie Hunt is so beautiful, so natural, so perfect for this role. Loved the whole movie from start to finish, there are no slack moments, you must watch it or loose the thread. What is more, the story line is believable - well almost, apart from bits here and there, such as you can not just change flights at moment's notice and it seems the action takes place over not just 48 hours but at least five days or more! Recommend it heartily - and wish there were more movies like this and much less the "other" kind that are full of dark scenes, killing, gore and brutality.

    From director Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, The Thomas Crown Affair, Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck), I spotted this pretty much out of nowhere and noticed the two leading stars, so I just to give it a try. Basically when she was a child Faith Corvatch (Marisa Tomei) used a Ouija Board that spelled out, in individual letters, the name "Damon Bradley", and this is supposedly the name of her soul mate. Now grown up she goes to a carnival and has a fortune teller using her Crystal Ball sees this name as well as the man she will marry, and then, on the verge of getting married, she overhears a phone call from her future husband's friend, it is Damon Bradley calling from Venice, Italy. Faith is determined to track him down, so she and her sister in law Kate (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) travel from New York to the Italian countryside and streets of Rome in search of the man they only know by name. They are following his trail with any information people can give from his last known whereabouts, but they seem to keep missing him by small amounts of time, even once by seconds and inches. Then Faith meets a young American man (Robert Downey Jr.), but has no interest in him until he hears the name and identifies himself as Damon Bradley, and after a spending a night together they have both fallen hopelessly in love. It only falls apart when he confesses that he is not Damon Bradley, his real name is Peter Wright, and she angrily walks out wanting to go home, but Kate finding attraction for her from Giovanni (Joaquim De Almeida) the Italian businessman might make that difficult. Peter comes back to her though and says that he has been looking for a Damon Bradley, and found out he has apparently moved to Positano, so Giovanni drives Peter, Faith and Kate there to find her at a posh hotel. Then they find this "Damon Bradley" (Billy Zane), a playboy with long hair and many women lapping him up, and confident she should try and see how things go she invites him to go. Of course it turns out this "Damon" is actually Peter's friend Harry and the whole thing was staged, and meanwhile Kate's husband Larry (Fisher Stevens) has travelled to find them and make up with his wife, but they planned to come home now anyway. Larry reveals to Faith that when he did the Ouiji board as a child and spelled the name out, it was all a prank, and he paid the fortune teller too, he didn't tell her because he was worried she would never talk to him again. Getting to the airport Peter is there to see off Faith, and they both overhear a real Damon Bradley (Adam LeFevre) at the information desk, so they can truly meet him, he is a reasonably good looking man, Peter explains the whole situation to him and he is perplexed, and of course he mentions being in love with her. In the end this Damon asks Faith if she loves Peter, and that if she truly does then she should embrace it, and she manages to catch him on his plane to Boston in time, and they kiss, with all the other passengers applauding, and they fly off into the sunset. Also starring John Benjamin Hickey as Dwayne and Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Leslie. Tomei is obviously attractive and she is also charming as the woman searching for the supposed man she has a destiny with, and Downey Jr. is likable as the man she actually should be with, their scenes together are great, and the supporting cast, including sleazy Zane works well too, I can see what the critics mean by a Cinderella style story, it certainly has that quality, and it makes you laugh in the right places, a good fun romantic comedy. Very good!

    This movie is so cute and so endearing, that I find it possible to watch frequently and still love it. Robert Downey Jr. is damn sexy to boot! The main character has it set in her mind from various childhood experiences with the supernatural that she is destined to be with one particular man, a Damon Bradley. But as she matures she "settles" for a foot doctor and they become engaged. Then one day, when a friend of her fianc&eacute;'s calls, she gets his number and his name, Damon Bradley. Then the search takes them to Italy to find her soulmate! She is a wacky individual who thinks she knows what is best and doesn't want any regrets, so I find her believable. Her silly best friend is Bonnie Hunt and she is hilarious. This is reminiscent of romantic movies of old, and has enough twists to keep you interested through the movie, as well as their romantic tension. I love this movie, and have loved it for years. Great for teens, which is when I found this movie, but I still love it.

    "Only You" is an immodest, sweet confection, a romantic comedy from one end to the other that doesn't have much meat on it but is the kind of movie that you cozy up with with cup of hot chocolate. It is slightly better than I might have expected and that's probably due to the talent involved. The movie stars Marisa Tomei, probably the only actress who could have made this material believable. She has the effect of being cute without being cutesy. She plays the appropriately named Faith who, since childhood, has believed that her entire destiny is leading her to be with a man named Damon Bradley. She is told by a fortune teller at the age of 11 that she and Bradley are destined to be together. She has no idea who this man is, but stands hard and fast to the information that their bond is written in the stars. Years later, now in her 20s, she has given up on Damon Bradley and is about to marry a podiatrist. On her wedding day, she receives a phone call from a friend of her husband-to-be saying that he cannot attend. His name . . . Damon Bradley, and he's on his way to Rome. Without a second thought, Faith and her sister-in-law Kate (played by the invaluable Bonnie Hunt) jump on a plane and go after him. Faith and Kate run around Venice like maniacs trying to track down Damon Bradley and when they find him, he turns out to be exactly what Faith had hoped he would be. He is handsome, dark-haired, charming and looks exactly like Robert Downey Jr. Who wouldn't swoon? The two embark on a sweet tour of Rome, very much in the same vein that Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck did in Roman Holiday. In fact, one of their stops is Pavonazzetto marble monument of The Mouth of Truth which was most famously seen in that 1953 classic. Yet, it wouldn't be romantic comedy if they simply fell in love. A complication arises with the validity of whether or not Downey actually is Damon Bradley. That sets the whole movie off on a wacky romp through the countryside as he tries to prove to her that he really is in love with her, despite the validity of his claim. This is all not to be believed. Only You is the kind of happy romantic comedy of a bygone era, before cynicism became an insurance policy. This is a movie that believes in destiny and fate and love at first sight and it is played through a cast of actors who are smart enough and convincing enough to pull it off. What distinguishes this movie above most is that it is always just a notch better than it should be. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. are beautiful people but they are such good actors that they are able to sell this story with a convincing charm. Tomei, with her wide-eyes, and pouty lips is able to push through this confection and make you believe that she really does believe everything that she is saying. Downey too is excellent, giving us a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. He loves this woman and he is willing to do what it takes to be with her. They're good together, even when the script tips in the direction of being too unbelievable for its own good. Both Downey and Tomei are wonderful, but for my money, the real gem of this movie is the supporting performance of Bonnie Hunt, as Faith's eternally-loyal sister-in-law. She always stands just to the side of Tomei and brings the movie an unexpected, and very funny, extra joy. Her comic timing is flawless. She has a manner of giving us funny asides that are delivered with just the right precision like: "I married a liar. Why? Because I married a man." I love that line and her comment when she and Faith are dismayed by an awful wedding dress that had been handed down, she says "If I had a dress like that, I'd give it away too."Kate has her own problems back home with an uncaring husband (Fisher Stevens) how has long ago abandoned love for a union that doesn't stretch beyond "Where's dinner?" She's a portrait of what happens to a marriage long after the ceremony when two people have settled into a relentless pattern of misunderstanding. Yet, what comes of their relationship completely took me by surprise. "Only You" was directed by Norman Jewison, the man who directed "Fiddler on the Roof", "In the Heat of the Night" and the one of the best romantic comedies of all time "Moonstruck". He doesn't succeed as well this time. This movie often feels like a nice day off, something he made as a lark. The movie is like cotton candy, all about romance and love and destiny shot against the background of one of the most beautiful locations on earth. There's nothing really wrong with that, it is probably better than it should be, given the creative talents but it won't leave you with much to think about.

    I was pleasantly surprised by this film. There are comparisons to "Roman Holiday," sure, and not without reason. And yes, the plot stretches the limits of credibility. And there are some plot holes big enough to steer a gondola through. But forget all of that. Every once in a while you need a sweet, fun romantic comedy, and this is one of them. But it isn't the top billed stars, Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, or even the Italian scenery, that make this film worth watching. The real scene stealer, and the best reason to watch "Only You," is the wonderful, and woefully under-appreciated, Bonnie Hunt. She shines in what in lesser hands would have been a throwaway role as the "understanding sister-in-law/best friend/voice of reason" (the kind of role that the major studios keep handing her). She steals practically every film she's in without even trying to. Now that takes real talent, and Miss Hunt has it. (And I defy anybody to see her in another film that doesn't get talked about much lately, "Loggerheads," where she turned in an incredibly moving dramatic performance, and not be affected by her. One of these days, she's going to get another role that will really let her shine.) So do yourself a favor. Get this DVD, a bottle of Chianti, and see this with someone you love, or would like to. And then watch it again, just to see why Bonnie Hunt's name should have received top billing. You won't regret it.

    I am a fan of the romantic comedy genre, not because every one of them is great (because probably a majority are not) but because when I find one that I like, I am more satisfied that I would be with almost any other genre. "Only You" is a great romantic comedy. I recognize that there are a ton of things about the plot and some of the characters that I could nit-pick, but so few of these films are well done and have enough emotion to leave me satisfied and happy that I see no point in complaining. The film basically involves Marisa Tomei being led to believe from her teenage years than her destined lover is a man named Damon Bradley, and when she is engaged to another man, she receives a call from her fianc&eacute;'s high school alum with the same name. Convinced he's the man, she flies to Italy to meet him and instead meets Robert Downey Jr, who has immediately fallen in love with Tomei and claims himself to be Bradley. Naturally, not a perfect film, and plenty of minor flaws, but I must say that this one was less predictable than the average film of it's type. It's mildly funny, and most importantly, it has, in my opinion, a perfect ending, the most important element of a romantic comedy for me. Beautifully scenic, mostly being shot in Italy. I'm not claiming the film to be flawless, but see it without super high expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. This film reminds me of watching a movie simply for enjoying it rather than criticizing it. ***1/2 out of ****

    'Only You' is the type of movie that makes anyone with a Y chromosome shudder in bewilderment. It embodies everything that romance-craving women want from a movie, and nothing a thoughtful viewer does. Marissa Tomei is told as a child that she will marry someone named Damon Bradley, and as an adult (I use the word generously) she decides to fly to Italy with one hours notice in pursuit of a stranger with that name. The crew at the airport accepts her idiotic reasoning for reopening the flight she missed ("The man I'll marry is on that plane." ?) and off she goes to Italy. When a man does this it's called 'stalking' or 'a security situation.' In the movie's grotesquely stereotypical idea of Italy, she improbably locates Damon after being completely boorish with a hotel clerk. The hotel clerk, who's old enough to give this girl an earful, instead instantly becomes cooperative, because he has no life, pride, story or values of his own. Bad writing is like that. Oh and her sister comes along too. I can only recount that much of the plot because this was so phenomenally stupid after 40 minutes that my attention drifted. Most people, I find, appreciate 'common sense' both in life and in movies. Nothing in this remotely resembles life as you know it. For the length of the movie, Tomei and Hunt sit in judgment of men and their perceived failings, without ever once acknowledging Tomei is at best a complete flake, and at worst... a fickle, developmentally-delayed lunatic. In the end, after a similar plane-boarding crisis is overcome and true love bursts out on the plane, a crowd of Italian airport personnel stands on the tarmac waving bye-bye (to a jumbo-jet?). When one thinks of the painstaking care and artistry on display in old film noirs, this movie looks like garbage.

Then the search takes them to Italy to find her soulmate! She is a wacky individual who thinks she knows what is best and doesn't want any regrets, so I find her believable. Her silly best friend is Bonnie Hunt and she is hilarious. This is reminiscent of romantic movies of old, and has enough twists to keep you interested through the movie, as well as their romantic tension. I love this movie, and have loved it for years. Great for teens, which is when I found this movie, but I still love it.

    "Only You" is an immodest, sweet confection, a romantic comedy from one end to the other that doesn't have much meat on it but is the kind of movie that you cozy up with with cup of hot chocolate. It is slightly better than I might have expected and that's probably due to the talent involved. The movie stars Marisa Tomei, probably the only actress who could have made this material believable. She has the effect of being cute without being cutesy. She plays the appropriately named Faith who, since childhood, has believed that her entire destiny is leading her to be with a man named Damon Bradley. She is told by a fortune teller at the age of 11 that she and Bradley are destined to be together. She has no idea who this man is, but stands hard and fast to the information that their bond is written in the stars. Years later, now in her 20s, she has given up on Damon Bradley and is about to marry a podiatrist. On her wedding day, she receives a phone call from a friend of her husband-to-be saying that he cannot attend. His name . . . Damon Bradley, and he's on his way to Rome. Without a second thought, Faith and her sister-in-law Kate (played by the invaluable Bonnie Hunt) jump on a plane and go after him. Faith and Kate run around Venice like maniacs trying to track down Damon Bradley and when they find him, he turns out to be exactly what Faith had hoped he would be. He is handsome, dark-haired, charming and looks exactly like Robert Downey Jr. Who wouldn't swoon? The two embark on a sweet tour of Rome, very much in the same vein that Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck did in Roman Holiday. In fact, one of their stops is Pavonazzetto marble monument of The Mouth of Truth which was most famously seen in that 1953 classic. Yet, it wouldn't be romantic comedy if they simply fell in love. A complication arises with the validity of whether or not Downey actually is Damon Bradley. That sets the whole movie off on a wacky romp through the countryside as he tries to prove to her that he really is in love with her, despite the validity of his claim. This is all not to be believed. Only You is the kind of happy romantic comedy of a bygone era, before cynicism became an insurance policy. This is a movie that believes in destiny and fate and love at first sight and it is played through a cast of actors who are smart enough and convincing enough to pull it off. What distinguishes this movie above most is that it is always just a notch better than it should be. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. are beautiful people but they are such good actors that they are able to sell this story with a convincing charm. Tomei, with her wide-eyes, and pouty lips is able to push through this confection and make you believe that she really does believe everything that she is saying. Downey too is excellent, giving us a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. He loves this woman and he is willing to do what it takes to be with her. They're good together, even when the script tips in the direction of being too unbelievable for its own good. Both Downey and Tomei are wonderful, but for my money, the real gem of this movie is the supporting performance of Bonnie Hunt, as Faith's eternally-loyal sister-in-law. She always stands just to the side of Tomei and brings the movie an unexpected, and very funny, extra joy. Her comic timing is flawless. She has a manner of giving us funny asides that are delivered with just the right precision like: "I married a liar. Why? Because I married a man." I love that line and her comment when she and Faith are dismayed by an awful wedding dress that had been handed down, she says "If I had a dress like that, I'd give it away too."Kate has her own problems back home with an uncaring husband (Fisher Stevens) how has long ago abandoned love for a union that doesn't stretch beyond "Where's dinner?" She's a portrait of what happens to a marriage long after the ceremony when two people have settled into a relentless pattern of misunderstanding. Yet, what comes of their relationship completely took me by surprise. "Only You" was directed by Norman Jewison, the man who directed "Fiddler on the Roof", "In the Heat of the Night" and the one of the best romantic comedies of all time "Moonstruck". He doesn't succeed as well this time. This movie often feels like a nice day off, something he made as a lark. The movie is like cotton candy, all about romance and love and destiny shot against the background of one of the most beautiful locations on earth. There's nothing really wrong with that, it is probably better than it should be, given the creative talents but it won't leave you with much to think about.

    I was pleasantly surprised by this film. There are comparisons to "Roman Holiday," sure, and not without reason. And yes, the plot stretches the limits of credibility. And there are some plot holes big enough to steer a gondola through. But forget all of that. Every once in a while you need a sweet, fun romantic comedy, and this is one of them. But it isn't the top billed stars, Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, or even the Italian scenery, that make this film worth watching. The real scene stealer, and the best reason to watch "Only You," is the wonderful, and woefully under-appreciated, Bonnie Hunt. She shines in what in lesser hands would have been a throwaway role as the "understanding sister-in-law/best friend/voice of reason" (the kind of role that the major studios keep handing her). She steals practically every film she's in without even trying to. Now that takes real talent, and Miss Hunt has it. (And I defy anybody to see her in another film that doesn't get talked about much lately, "Loggerheads," where she turned in an incredibly moving dramatic performance, and not be affected by her. One of these days, she's going to get another role that will really let her shine.) So do yourself a favor. Get this DVD, a bottle of Chianti, and see this with someone you love, or would like to. And then watch it again, just to see why Bonnie Hunt's name should have received top billing. You won't regret it.

    I am a fan of the romantic comedy genre, not because every one of them is great (because probably a majority are not) but because when I find one that I like, I am more satisfied that I would be with almost any other genre. "Only You" is a great romantic comedy. I recognize that there are a ton of things about the plot and some of the characters that I could nit-pick, but so few of these films are well done and have enough emotion to leave me satisfied and happy that I see no point in complaining. The film basically involves Marisa Tomei being led to believe from her teenage years than her destined lover is a man named Damon Bradley, and when she is engaged to another man, she receives a call from her fianc&eacute;'s high school alum with the same name. Convinced he's the man, she flies to Italy to meet him and instead meets Robert Downey Jr, who has immediately fallen in love with Tomei and claims himself to be Bradley. Naturally, not a perfect film, and plenty of minor flaws, but I must say that this one was less predictable than the average film of it's type. It's mildly funny, and most importantly, it has, in my opinion, a perfect ending, the most important element of a romantic comedy for me. Beautifully scenic, mostly being shot in Italy. I'm not claiming the film to be flawless, but see it without super high expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. This film reminds me of watching a movie simply for enjoying it rather than criticizing it. ***1/2 out of ****

    'Only You' is the type of movie that makes anyone with a Y chromosome shudder in bewilderment. It embodies everything that romance-craving women want from a movie, and nothing a thoughtful viewer does. Marissa Tomei is told as a child that she will marry someone named Damon Bradley, and as an adult (I use the word generously) she decides to fly to Italy with one hours notice in pursuit of a stranger with that name. The crew at the airport accepts her idiotic reasoning for reopening the flight she missed ("The man I'll marry is on that plane." ?) and off she goes to Italy. When a man does this it's called 'stalking' or 'a security situation.' In the movie's grotesquely stereotypical idea of Italy, she improbably locates Damon after being completely boorish with a hotel clerk. The hotel clerk, who's old enough to give this girl an earful, instead instantly becomes cooperative, because he has no life, pride, story or values of his own. Bad writing is like that. Oh and her sister comes along too. I can only recount that much of the plot because this was so phenomenally stupid after 40 minutes that my attention drifted. Most people, I find, appreciate 'common sense' both in life and in movies. Nothing in this remotely resembles life as you know it. For the length of the movie, Tomei and Hunt sit in judgment of men and their perceived failings, without ever once acknowledging Tomei is at best a complete flake, and at worst... a fickle, developmentally-delayed lunatic. In the end, after a similar plane-boarding crisis is overcome and true love bursts out on the plane, a crowd of Italian airport personnel stands on the tarmac waving bye-bye (to a jumbo-jet?). When one thinks of the painstaking care and artistry on display in old film noirs, this movie looks like garbage.

    ...yes, why can't I just take it for what it is? A flimcy-flumcy childish fairytale on hallucinogenics?? Why??? I'll tell You why; it's a complete waste of location(Rome, Italy), talent(Tomei, probably director too), genre(romance) and my time. Not at any time, the director pays any respect to.... -anything. The stressed pace of action, lack of development of character, Rome set as a stereotypic background prop for romance(I love Rome) etc. etc. etc. Stereotypic 19.th century sexual roles without any hint of either adult love affair or sexual attraction. Just a predictable mass Hollywood production. Why does Tomei even consider playing any part of this? (I couldn't watch till the end just utterly crap crap crap- sorry(not)). Watch some Jane Austen(1995 Pride & Prejustice) or just Casablanca, and You'll lose the bad taste of.... crap in your mouth(sorry again). 100% disappointed

    The movie about a young schoolteacher Faith (Marisa Tomei) obsessed with her "soul mate" after year ago as child used Ouja board she and her brother used and the name come up Damon Bradley. Now about to married to a foot doctor, she receives a call by one of her fianc&eacute;'s friend to wishes them luck but his name turned to be Damon Bradley. So Faith becomes a runaway bride and goes with her friend (Bonnie Hunt) to travel to Venice, Italy to meet Mr. Right. But then she run over a shoe salesman (Robert Downey Jr.) and he fall for her. The entire movie is stupid and a waste of time, Faith is stupid; she run-off to find her "soul mate" that she doesn't know and obsessed with it since she was a kid (he probably don't like her and Bonnie Hunt's character is right she need to see psychiatrist) this were for real her fianc&eacute; would go after (what she didn't wad that her brother paid the fortune teller and moved the board the entire time when they were kids). Robert Downey Jr.'s character fall in love with Faith so quickly and neither of them harder know each other (both them are silly anyway). Bonnie Hunt's character is the only one with any sense. At the end of the movie it turn out the real "Damon Bradley" is older man and stupid-looking. I heard some comment that is this for real Downey Jr.'s character wouldn't want her anymore at the end, she treated him like dirt and he tried to help her entire time. I wish they would making next time as vacation movie (Monte Carlo).

    It would be easy to say that this is Marisa Tomei's film, but Robert Downey, Jr. -- particularly during this part of his career -- was a particularly charismatic actor. And, Downey doesn't even come into the film until it is 1/3 over! But, then, to an extent, he dominates the film. Tomei has had a relatively successful career since making this film, but not as successful as I would have predicted, because she is delightful here. And Downey has had a successful film career since his "recovery", but he has never been able to play the somewhat innocent love interest since his problems. And that's unfortunate, because as this film (and "Chances Are") proved...nobody was better at least in this generation of actors (Cary Grant mastered it decades before). The movie is clearly a woman's film, but I still liked it. The plot is clever, with a couple of nice twists, and the theme of destiny is always an interesting one. Bonnie Hunt is charming as the "best friend". If you like romantic films or light comedies, then this is for you. Highly recommended.

    I can and do watch it over and over again: no violence, brutality, dark images or ugliness; all smiles, fun and beautiful locations with beautiful people in beautiful outfits. Locations themselves are worth watching it for, not to mention the acting which is brilliant. Tomei and Dawney seem such a wonderfully matching couple, you can easily believe they are a couple in real life. Bonnie Hunt is so beautiful, so natural, so perfect for this role. Loved the whole movie from start to finish, there are no slack moments, you must watch it or loose the thread. What is more, the story line is believable - well almost, apart from bits here and there, such as you can not just change flights at moment's notice and it seems the action takes place over not just 48 hours but at least five days or more! Recommend it heartily - and wish there were more movies like this and much less the "other" kind that are full of dark scenes, killing, gore and brutality.

    From director Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, The Thomas Crown Affair, Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck), I spotted this pretty much out of nowhere and noticed the two leading stars, so I just to give it a try. Basically when she was a child Faith Corvatch (Marisa Tomei) used a Ouija Board that spelled out, in individual letters, the name "Damon Bradley", and this is supposedly the name of her soul mate. Now grown up she goes to a carnival and has a fortune teller using her Crystal Ball sees this name as well as the man she will marry, and then, on the verge of getting married, she overhears a phone call from her future husband's friend, it is Damon Bradley calling from Venice, Italy. Faith is determined to track him down, so she and her sister in law Kate (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) travel from New York to the Italian countryside and streets of Rome in search of the man they only know by name. They are following his trail with any information people can give from his last known whereabouts, but they seem to keep missing him by small amounts of time, even once by seconds and inches. Then Faith meets a young American man (Robert Downey Jr.), but has no interest in him until he hears the name and identifies himself as Damon Bradley, and after a spending a night together they have both fallen hopelessly in love. It only falls apart when he confesses that he is not Damon Bradley, his real name is Peter Wright, and she angrily walks out wanting to go home, but Kate finding attraction for her from Giovanni (Joaquim De Almeida) the Italian businessman might make that difficult. Peter comes back to her though and says that he has been looking for a Damon Bradley, and found out he has apparently moved to Positano, so Giovanni drives Peter, Faith and Kate there to find her at a posh hotel. Then they find this "Damon Bradley" (Billy Zane), a playboy with long hair and many women lapping him up, and confident she should try and see how things go she invites him to go. Of course it turns out this "Damon" is actually Peter's friend Harry and the whole thing was staged, and meanwhile Kate's husband Larry (Fisher Stevens) has travelled to find them and make up with his wife, but they planned to come home now anyway. Larry reveals to Faith that when he did the Ouiji board as a child and spelled the name out, it was all a prank, and he paid the fortune teller too, he didn't tell her because he was worried she would never talk to him again. Getting to the airport Peter is there to see off Faith, and they both overhear a real Damon Bradley (Adam LeFevre) at the information desk, so they can truly meet him, he is a reasonably good looking man, Peter explains the whole situation to him and he is perplexed, and of course he mentions being in love with her. In the end this Damon asks Faith if she loves Peter, and that if she truly does then she should embrace it, and she manages to catch him on his plane to Boston in time, and they kiss, with all the other passengers applauding, and they fly off into the sunset. Also starring John Benjamin Hickey as Dwayne and Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Leslie. Tomei is obviously attractive and she is also charming as the woman searching for the supposed man she has a destiny with, and Downey Jr. is likable as the man she actually should be with, their scenes together are great, and the supporting cast, including sleazy Zane works well too, I can see what the critics mean by a Cinderella style story, it certainly has that quality, and it makes you laugh in the right places, a good fun romantic comedy. Very good!

When one thinks of the painstaking care and artistry on display in old film noirs, this movie looks like garbage.

    ...yes, why can't I just take it for what it is? A flimcy-flumcy childish fairytale on hallucinogenics?? Why??? I'll tell You why; it's a complete waste of location(Rome, Italy), talent(Tomei, probably director too), genre(romance) and my time. Not at any time, the director pays any respect to.... -anything. The stressed pace of action, lack of development of character, Rome set as a stereotypic background prop for romance(I love Rome) etc. etc. etc. Stereotypic 19.th century sexual roles without any hint of either adult love affair or sexual attraction. Just a predictable mass Hollywood production. Why does Tomei even consider playing any part of this? (I couldn't watch till the end just utterly crap crap crap- sorry(not)). Watch some Jane Austen(1995 Pride & Prejustice) or just Casablanca, and You'll lose the bad taste of.... crap in your mouth(sorry again). 100% disappointed

    The movie about a young schoolteacher Faith (Marisa Tomei) obsessed with her "soul mate" after year ago as child used Ouja board she and her brother used and the name come up Damon Bradley. Now about to married to a foot doctor, she receives a call by one of her fianc&eacute;'s friend to wishes them luck but his name turned to be Damon Bradley. So Faith becomes a runaway bride and goes with her friend (Bonnie Hunt) to travel to Venice, Italy to meet Mr. Right. But then she run over a shoe salesman (Robert Downey Jr.) and he fall for her. The entire movie is stupid and a waste of time, Faith is stupid; she run-off to find her "soul mate" that she doesn't know and obsessed with it since she was a kid (he probably don't like her and Bonnie Hunt's character is right she need to see psychiatrist) this were for real her fianc&eacute; would go after (what she didn't wad that her brother paid the fortune teller and moved the board the entire time when they were kids). Robert Downey Jr.'s character fall in love with Faith so quickly and neither of them harder know each other (both them are silly anyway). Bonnie Hunt's character is the only one with any sense. At the end of the movie it turn out the real "Damon Bradley" is older man and stupid-looking. I heard some comment that is this for real Downey Jr.'s character wouldn't want her anymore at the end, she treated him like dirt and he tried to help her entire time. I wish they would making next time as vacation movie (Monte Carlo).

    It would be easy to say that this is Marisa Tomei's film, but Robert Downey, Jr. -- particularly during this part of his career -- was a particularly charismatic actor. And, Downey doesn't even come into the film until it is 1/3 over! But, then, to an extent, he dominates the film. Tomei has had a relatively successful career since making this film, but not as successful as I would have predicted, because she is delightful here. And Downey has had a successful film career since his "recovery", but he has never been able to play the somewhat innocent love interest since his problems. And that's unfortunate, because as this film (and "Chances Are") proved...nobody was better at least in this generation of actors (Cary Grant mastered it decades before). The movie is clearly a woman's film, but I still liked it. The plot is clever, with a couple of nice twists, and the theme of destiny is always an interesting one. Bonnie Hunt is charming as the "best friend". If you like romantic films or light comedies, then this is for you. Highly recommended.

    I can and do watch it over and over again: no violence, brutality, dark images or ugliness; all smiles, fun and beautiful locations with beautiful people in beautiful outfits. Locations themselves are worth watching it for, not to mention the acting which is brilliant. Tomei and Dawney seem such a wonderfully matching couple, you can easily believe they are a couple in real life. Bonnie Hunt is so beautiful, so natural, so perfect for this role. Loved the whole movie from start to finish, there are no slack moments, you must watch it or loose the thread. What is more, the story line is believable - well almost, apart from bits here and there, such as you can not just change flights at moment's notice and it seems the action takes place over not just 48 hours but at least five days or more! Recommend it heartily - and wish there were more movies like this and much less the "other" kind that are full of dark scenes, killing, gore and brutality.

    From director Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, The Thomas Crown Affair, Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck), I spotted this pretty much out of nowhere and noticed the two leading stars, so I just to give it a try. Basically when she was a child Faith Corvatch (Marisa Tomei) used a Ouija Board that spelled out, in individual letters, the name "Damon Bradley", and this is supposedly the name of her soul mate. Now grown up she goes to a carnival and has a fortune teller using her Crystal Ball sees this name as well as the man she will marry, and then, on the verge of getting married, she overhears a phone call from her future husband's friend, it is Damon Bradley calling from Venice, Italy. Faith is determined to track him down, so she and her sister in law Kate (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) travel from New York to the Italian countryside and streets of Rome in search of the man they only know by name. They are following his trail with any information people can give from his last known whereabouts, but they seem to keep missing him by small amounts of time, even once by seconds and inches. Then Faith meets a young American man (Robert Downey Jr.), but has no interest in him until he hears the name and identifies himself as Damon Bradley, and after a spending a night together they have both fallen hopelessly in love. It only falls apart when he confesses that he is not Damon Bradley, his real name is Peter Wright, and she angrily walks out wanting to go home, but Kate finding attraction for her from Giovanni (Joaquim De Almeida) the Italian businessman might make that difficult. Peter comes back to her though and says that he has been looking for a Damon Bradley, and found out he has apparently moved to Positano, so Giovanni drives Peter, Faith and Kate there to find her at a posh hotel. Then they find this "Damon Bradley" (Billy Zane), a playboy with long hair and many women lapping him up, and confident she should try and see how things go she invites him to go. Of course it turns out this "Damon" is actually Peter's friend Harry and the whole thing was staged, and meanwhile Kate's husband Larry (Fisher Stevens) has travelled to find them and make up with his wife, but they planned to come home now anyway. Larry reveals to Faith that when he did the Ouiji board as a child and spelled the name out, it was all a prank, and he paid the fortune teller too, he didn't tell her because he was worried she would never talk to him again. Getting to the airport Peter is there to see off Faith, and they both overhear a real Damon Bradley (Adam LeFevre) at the information desk, so they can truly meet him, he is a reasonably good looking man, Peter explains the whole situation to him and he is perplexed, and of course he mentions being in love with her. In the end this Damon asks Faith if she loves Peter, and that if she truly does then she should embrace it, and she manages to catch him on his plane to Boston in time, and they kiss, with all the other passengers applauding, and they fly off into the sunset. Also starring John Benjamin Hickey as Dwayne and Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Leslie. Tomei is obviously attractive and she is also charming as the woman searching for the supposed man she has a destiny with, and Downey Jr. is likable as the man she actually should be with, their scenes together are great, and the supporting cast, including sleazy Zane works well too, I can see what the critics mean by a Cinderella style story, it certainly has that quality, and it makes you laugh in the right places, a good fun romantic comedy. Very good!

    This movie is so cute and so endearing, that I find it possible to watch frequently and still love it. Robert Downey Jr. is damn sexy to boot! The main character has it set in her mind from various childhood experiences with the supernatural that she is destined to be with one particular man, a Damon Bradley. But as she matures she "settles" for a foot doctor and they become engaged. Then one day, when a friend of her fianc&eacute;'s calls, she gets his number and his name, Damon Bradley. Then the search takes them to Italy to find her soulmate! She is a wacky individual who thinks she knows what is best and doesn't want any regrets, so I find her believable. Her silly best friend is Bonnie Hunt and she is hilarious. This is reminiscent of romantic movies of old, and has enough twists to keep you interested through the movie, as well as their romantic tension. I love this movie, and have loved it for years. Great for teens, which is when I found this movie, but I still love it.

    "Only You" is an immodest, sweet confection, a romantic comedy from one end to the other that doesn't have much meat on it but is the kind of movie that you cozy up with with cup of hot chocolate. It is slightly better than I might have expected and that's probably due to the talent involved. The movie stars Marisa Tomei, probably the only actress who could have made this material believable. She has the effect of being cute without being cutesy. She plays the appropriately named Faith who, since childhood, has believed that her entire destiny is leading her to be with a man named Damon Bradley. She is told by a fortune teller at the age of 11 that she and Bradley are destined to be together. She has no idea who this man is, but stands hard and fast to the information that their bond is written in the stars. Years later, now in her 20s, she has given up on Damon Bradley and is about to marry a podiatrist. On her wedding day, she receives a phone call from a friend of her husband-to-be saying that he cannot attend. His name . . . Damon Bradley, and he's on his way to Rome. Without a second thought, Faith and her sister-in-law Kate (played by the invaluable Bonnie Hunt) jump on a plane and go after him. Faith and Kate run around Venice like maniacs trying to track down Damon Bradley and when they find him, he turns out to be exactly what Faith had hoped he would be. He is handsome, dark-haired, charming and looks exactly like Robert Downey Jr. Who wouldn't swoon? The two embark on a sweet tour of Rome, very much in the same vein that Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck did in Roman Holiday. In fact, one of their stops is Pavonazzetto marble monument of The Mouth of Truth which was most famously seen in that 1953 classic. Yet, it wouldn't be romantic comedy if they simply fell in love. A complication arises with the validity of whether or not Downey actually is Damon Bradley. That sets the whole movie off on a wacky romp through the countryside as he tries to prove to her that he really is in love with her, despite the validity of his claim. This is all not to be believed. Only You is the kind of happy romantic comedy of a bygone era, before cynicism became an insurance policy. This is a movie that believes in destiny and fate and love at first sight and it is played through a cast of actors who are smart enough and convincing enough to pull it off. What distinguishes this movie above most is that it is always just a notch better than it should be. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. are beautiful people but they are such good actors that they are able to sell this story with a convincing charm. Tomei, with her wide-eyes, and pouty lips is able to push through this confection and make you believe that she really does believe everything that she is saying. Downey too is excellent, giving us a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. He loves this woman and he is willing to do what it takes to be with her. They're good together, even when the script tips in the direction of being too unbelievable for its own good. Both Downey and Tomei are wonderful, but for my money, the real gem of this movie is the supporting performance of Bonnie Hunt, as Faith's eternally-loyal sister-in-law. She always stands just to the side of Tomei and brings the movie an unexpected, and very funny, extra joy. Her comic timing is flawless. She has a manner of giving us funny asides that are delivered with just the right precision like: "I married a liar. Why? Because I married a man." I love that line and her comment when she and Faith are dismayed by an awful wedding dress that had been handed down, she says "If I had a dress like that, I'd give it away too."Kate has her own problems back home with an uncaring husband (Fisher Stevens) how has long ago abandoned love for a union that doesn't stretch beyond "Where's dinner?" She's a portrait of what happens to a marriage long after the ceremony when two people have settled into a relentless pattern of misunderstanding. Yet, what comes of their relationship completely took me by surprise. "Only You" was directed by Norman Jewison, the man who directed "Fiddler on the Roof", "In the Heat of the Night" and the one of the best romantic comedies of all time "Moonstruck". He doesn't succeed as well this time. This movie often feels like a nice day off, something he made as a lark. The movie is like cotton candy, all about romance and love and destiny shot against the background of one of the most beautiful locations on earth. There's nothing really wrong with that, it is probably better than it should be, given the creative talents but it won't leave you with much to think about.

    I was pleasantly surprised by this film. There are comparisons to "Roman Holiday," sure, and not without reason. And yes, the plot stretches the limits of credibility. And there are some plot holes big enough to steer a gondola through. But forget all of that. Every once in a while you need a sweet, fun romantic comedy, and this is one of them. But it isn't the top billed stars, Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, or even the Italian scenery, that make this film worth watching. The real scene stealer, and the best reason to watch "Only You," is the wonderful, and woefully under-appreciated, Bonnie Hunt. She shines in what in lesser hands would have been a throwaway role as the "understanding sister-in-law/best friend/voice of reason" (the kind of role that the major studios keep handing her). She steals practically every film she's in without even trying to. Now that takes real talent, and Miss Hunt has it. (And I defy anybody to see her in another film that doesn't get talked about much lately, "Loggerheads," where she turned in an incredibly moving dramatic performance, and not be affected by her. One of these days, she's going to get another role that will really let her shine.) So do yourself a favor. Get this DVD, a bottle of Chianti, and see this with someone you love, or would like to. And then watch it again, just to see why Bonnie Hunt's name should have received top billing. You won't regret it.

    I am a fan of the romantic comedy genre, not because every one of them is great (because probably a majority are not) but because when I find one that I like, I am more satisfied that I would be with almost any other genre. "Only You" is a great romantic comedy. I recognize that there are a ton of things about the plot and some of the characters that I could nit-pick, but so few of these films are well done and have enough emotion to leave me satisfied and happy that I see no point in complaining. The film basically involves Marisa Tomei being led to believe from her teenage years than her destined lover is a man named Damon Bradley, and when she is engaged to another man, she receives a call from her fianc&eacute;'s high school alum with the same name. Convinced he's the man, she flies to Italy to meet him and instead meets Robert Downey Jr, who has immediately fallen in love with Tomei and claims himself to be Bradley. Naturally, not a perfect film, and plenty of minor flaws, but I must say that this one was less predictable than the average film of it's type. It's mildly funny, and most importantly, it has, in my opinion, a perfect ending, the most important element of a romantic comedy for me. Beautifully scenic, mostly being shot in Italy. I'm not claiming the film to be flawless, but see it without super high expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. This film reminds me of watching a movie simply for enjoying it rather than criticizing it. ***1/2 out of ****

    'Only You' is the type of movie that makes anyone with a Y chromosome shudder in bewilderment. It embodies everything that romance-craving women want from a movie, and nothing a thoughtful viewer does. Marissa Tomei is told as a child that she will marry someone named Damon Bradley, and as an adult (I use the word generously) she decides to fly to Italy with one hours notice in pursuit of a stranger with that name. The crew at the airport accepts her idiotic reasoning for reopening the flight she missed ("The man I'll marry is on that plane." ?) and off she goes to Italy. When a man does this it's called 'stalking' or 'a security situation.' In the movie's grotesquely stereotypical idea of Italy, she improbably locates Damon after being completely boorish with a hotel clerk. The hotel clerk, who's old enough to give this girl an earful, instead instantly becomes cooperative, because he has no life, pride, story or values of his own. Bad writing is like that. Oh and her sister comes along too. I can only recount that much of the plot because this was so phenomenally stupid after 40 minutes that my attention drifted. Most people, I find, appreciate 'common sense' both in life and in movies. Nothing in this remotely resembles life as you know it. For the length of the movie, Tomei and Hunt sit in judgment of men and their perceived failings, without ever once acknowledging Tomei is at best a complete flake, and at worst... a fickle, developmentally-delayed lunatic. In the end, after a similar plane-boarding crisis is overcome and true love bursts out on the plane, a crowd of Italian airport personnel stands on the tarmac waving bye-bye (to a jumbo-jet?). When one thinks of the painstaking care and artistry on display in old film noirs, this movie looks like garbage.

This is reminiscent of romantic movies of old, and has enough twists to keep you interested through the movie, as well as their romantic tension. I love this movie, and have loved it for years. Great for teens, which is when I found this movie, but I still love it.

    "Only You" is an immodest, sweet confection, a romantic comedy from one end to the other that doesn't have much meat on it but is the kind of movie that you cozy up with with cup of hot chocolate. It is slightly better than I might have expected and that's probably due to the talent involved. The movie stars Marisa Tomei, probably the only actress who could have made this material believable. She has the effect of being cute without being cutesy. She plays the appropriately named Faith who, since childhood, has believed that her entire destiny is leading her to be with a man named Damon Bradley. She is told by a fortune teller at the age of 11 that she and Bradley are destined to be together. She has no idea who this man is, but stands hard and fast to the information that their bond is written in the stars. Years later, now in her 20s, she has given up on Damon Bradley and is about to marry a podiatrist. On her wedding day, she receives a phone call from a friend of her husband-to-be saying that he cannot attend. His name . . . Damon Bradley, and he's on his way to Rome. Without a second thought, Faith and her sister-in-law Kate (played by the invaluable Bonnie Hunt) jump on a plane and go after him. Faith and Kate run around Venice like maniacs trying to track down Damon Bradley and when they find him, he turns out to be exactly what Faith had hoped he would be. He is handsome, dark-haired, charming and looks exactly like Robert Downey Jr. Who wouldn't swoon? The two embark on a sweet tour of Rome, very much in the same vein that Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck did in Roman Holiday. In fact, one of their stops is Pavonazzetto marble monument of The Mouth of Truth which was most famously seen in that 1953 classic. Yet, it wouldn't be romantic comedy if they simply fell in love. A complication arises with the validity of whether or not Downey actually is Damon Bradley. That sets the whole movie off on a wacky romp through the countryside as he tries to prove to her that he really is in love with her, despite the validity of his claim. This is all not to be believed. Only You is the kind of happy romantic comedy of a bygone era, before cynicism became an insurance policy. This is a movie that believes in destiny and fate and love at first sight and it is played through a cast of actors who are smart enough and convincing enough to pull it off. What distinguishes this movie above most is that it is always just a notch better than it should be. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. are beautiful people but they are such good actors that they are able to sell this story with a convincing charm. Tomei, with her wide-eyes, and pouty lips is able to push through this confection and make you believe that she really does believe everything that she is saying. Downey too is excellent, giving us a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. He loves this woman and he is willing to do what it takes to be with her. They're good together, even when the script tips in the direction of being too unbelievable for its own good. Both Downey and Tomei are wonderful, but for my money, the real gem of this movie is the supporting performance of Bonnie Hunt, as Faith's eternally-loyal sister-in-law. She always stands just to the side of Tomei and brings the movie an unexpected, and very funny, extra joy. Her comic timing is flawless. She has a manner of giving us funny asides that are delivered with just the right precision like: "I married a liar. Why? Because I married a man." I love that line and her comment when she and Faith are dismayed by an awful wedding dress that had been handed down, she says "If I had a dress like that, I'd give it away too."Kate has her own problems back home with an uncaring husband (Fisher Stevens) how has long ago abandoned love for a union that doesn't stretch beyond "Where's dinner?" She's a portrait of what happens to a marriage long after the ceremony when two people have settled into a relentless pattern of misunderstanding. Yet, what comes of their relationship completely took me by surprise. "Only You" was directed by Norman Jewison, the man who directed "Fiddler on the Roof", "In the Heat of the Night" and the one of the best romantic comedies of all time "Moonstruck". He doesn't succeed as well this time. This movie often feels like a nice day off, something he made as a lark. The movie is like cotton candy, all about romance and love and destiny shot against the background of one of the most beautiful locations on earth. There's nothing really wrong with that, it is probably better than it should be, given the creative talents but it won't leave you with much to think about.

    I was pleasantly surprised by this film. There are comparisons to "Roman Holiday," sure, and not without reason. And yes, the plot stretches the limits of credibility. And there are some plot holes big enough to steer a gondola through. But forget all of that. Every once in a while you need a sweet, fun romantic comedy, and this is one of them. But it isn't the top billed stars, Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, or even the Italian scenery, that make this film worth watching. The real scene stealer, and the best reason to watch "Only You," is the wonderful, and woefully under-appreciated, Bonnie Hunt. She shines in what in lesser hands would have been a throwaway role as the "understanding sister-in-law/best friend/voice of reason" (the kind of role that the major studios keep handing her). She steals practically every film she's in without even trying to. Now that takes real talent, and Miss Hunt has it. (And I defy anybody to see her in another film that doesn't get talked about much lately, "Loggerheads," where she turned in an incredibly moving dramatic performance, and not be affected by her. One of these days, she's going to get another role that will really let her shine.) So do yourself a favor. Get this DVD, a bottle of Chianti, and see this with someone you love, or would like to. And then watch it again, just to see why Bonnie Hunt's name should have received top billing. You won't regret it.

    I am a fan of the romantic comedy genre, not because every one of them is great (because probably a majority are not) but because when I find one that I like, I am more satisfied that I would be with almost any other genre. "Only You" is a great romantic comedy. I recognize that there are a ton of things about the plot and some of the characters that I could nit-pick, but so few of these films are well done and have enough emotion to leave me satisfied and happy that I see no point in complaining. The film basically involves Marisa Tomei being led to believe from her teenage years than her destined lover is a man named Damon Bradley, and when she is engaged to another man, she receives a call from her fianc&eacute;'s high school alum with the same name. Convinced he's the man, she flies to Italy to meet him and instead meets Robert Downey Jr, who has immediately fallen in love with Tomei and claims himself to be Bradley. Naturally, not a perfect film, and plenty of minor flaws, but I must say that this one was less predictable than the average film of it's type. It's mildly funny, and most importantly, it has, in my opinion, a perfect ending, the most important element of a romantic comedy for me. Beautifully scenic, mostly being shot in Italy. I'm not claiming the film to be flawless, but see it without super high expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. This film reminds me of watching a movie simply for enjoying it rather than criticizing it. ***1/2 out of ****

    'Only You' is the type of movie that makes anyone with a Y chromosome shudder in bewilderment. It embodies everything that romance-craving women want from a movie, and nothing a thoughtful viewer does. Marissa Tomei is told as a child that she will marry someone named Damon Bradley, and as an adult (I use the word generously) she decides to fly to Italy with one hours notice in pursuit of a stranger with that name. The crew at the airport accepts her idiotic reasoning for reopening the flight she missed ("The man I'll marry is on that plane." ?) and off she goes to Italy. When a man does this it's called 'stalking' or 'a security situation.' In the movie's grotesquely stereotypical idea of Italy, she improbably locates Damon after being completely boorish with a hotel clerk. The hotel clerk, who's old enough to give this girl an earful, instead instantly becomes cooperative, because he has no life, pride, story or values of his own. Bad writing is like that. Oh and her sister comes along too. I can only recount that much of the plot because this was so phenomenally stupid after 40 minutes that my attention drifted. Most people, I find, appreciate 'common sense' both in life and in movies. Nothing in this remotely resembles life as you know it. For the length of the movie, Tomei and Hunt sit in judgment of men and their perceived failings, without ever once acknowledging Tomei is at best a complete flake, and at worst... a fickle, developmentally-delayed lunatic. In the end, after a similar plane-boarding crisis is overcome and true love bursts out on the plane, a crowd of Italian airport personnel stands on the tarmac waving bye-bye (to a jumbo-jet?). When one thinks of the painstaking care and artistry on display in old film noirs, this movie looks like garbage.

    ...yes, why can't I just take it for what it is? A flimcy-flumcy childish fairytale on hallucinogenics?? Why??? I'll tell You why; it's a complete waste of location(Rome, Italy), talent(Tomei, probably director too), genre(romance) and my time. Not at any time, the director pays any respect to.... -anything. The stressed pace of action, lack of development of character, Rome set as a stereotypic background prop for romance(I love Rome) etc. etc. etc. Stereotypic 19.th century sexual roles without any hint of either adult love affair or sexual attraction. Just a predictable mass Hollywood production. Why does Tomei even consider playing any part of this? (I couldn't watch till the end just utterly crap crap crap- sorry(not)). Watch some Jane Austen(1995 Pride & Prejustice) or just Casablanca, and You'll lose the bad taste of.... crap in your mouth(sorry again). 100% disappointed
