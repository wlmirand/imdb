    Jobe is resuscitated by Jonathan Walker, and he wants Jobe to create a special computer chip that would connect all the computers in the world into one network. Walker would control and use the system, But he doesn't realise a group of teenage hackers, and Patrick Bergin, are on to him and out to stop his plan. He also doesn't realise that Jobe is now the bloke from The Taking Of Beverly Hills and not Jeff Fahey...... What is there to say? Yes the film is bad, there is no real explanation as to why Jobe is a I've, but he is, and when he's in cyber world, he turns into some strange Jim Carrey wannabe hybrid. The plot is silly, narrative is all over the place, and the cast know its ridiculous, but blimey Charlie, its a lot of fun to watch. The effects are really bad, even worse than Spawn, and Bergin looks totally bemused to be in this, its long way from the time he starred in that Robin Hood movie that didn't star Kevin Costner. Fewer really overacts, and despite his attempts to be menacing, he's just too camp, and becomes the reason why the film is so funny. Its rubbish, but its entertaining rubbish, but I cannot give it a rather higher than a four, because it is a fundamentally bad film, but not bottom 100 worthy. Plus its the best film ever to come as a special feature on the originals DVD.

    The original film is awful and so is this obnoxious sequel, which scores points for improving ever so slightly on its predecessor but loses them again for being so devoid of potential that even Jeff Fahey said no thanks - and look at some of the rubbish he's made. (How great was he in 'Lost', though?) Matt Frewer replaces him as the computer-enhanced genius who's now floating around in cyberspace with a desire to take over the real world. Trying to stop him are Austin O'Brien, forgotten child actor returning from the first movie, and Patrick Bergin, whose career's seen better days. With a trashy script, a story which barely fills the eighty-five minute running time and performances which rarely rise above the level of shite, the movie's left with nothing to wow you bar its beloved VR segments, and they're nothing special. The plot jumps ahead of itself so often it soon becomes clear that huge chunks of the movie have been hacked out, so there's something to be thankful for.

    The first 15 minutes or so of Lawnmowerman 2 were just utterly confusing. There is a man caught in cyberspace, an exploding building, paraplegic undergoing rehab and sudden jump to the future, all in a confused jumble. At this point I actually went online to check that I got the right movie, I was surprised to learn that I did. Once the initial confusion has settled down a bit you can get into the story proper which is only slight more watchable than the messed up intro. We have a bunch of kids in "the future" fighting against a crippled evil genius trying to control cyberspace, and all of it is clad in a super cheesy mid 90's aesthetic. It's kind of like "The Matrix" but for kids; with jargon like 'information super highway' and a dumb plot it feels both dated and inane. And it's not even cheesy enough to be funny. There is no point in commenting on acting, directing and so on, none of it matters with a film like this.

    This is not so much a review as it is to the confession of a crime; a tale of theft, an unreturned VHS-tape, left at the rental-return but not properly shoved into the slot and having taking said film home to be watched for free. See, it was the middle of the night, the shop long closed and the label of said videotape said "Lawnmover Man 2". Having been a huge fan of the first part, I couldn't resist crabbing the tape, dragging it home and shoving it into the player. Even acquired a litre of plonk wine (back then favoured by impoverished students) to celebrate the joyous occasion of finally seeing a sequel. The plonk didn't help it, the bottle empty before the second half of the film, upon which I ended this farce and pressed first the "stop", then the "eject" bottom. Returned the VHS to said return-slot the same night, not wanting have it at home and fearing that a trash bin would reject the tape. And, if whoever had to pay late-fees for this tape happens to read this review: consider this the price of an education. One doesn't rent crap like that! No points from me and the obligatory one point that IMDb gives it.

    Oh deal, just when we though Hollywood was recently going down the tube, this movie popped up in the Comcast on-demand option. Nothing beats watching movies free or for a fraction of buying the disc or renting it on netflick. This movie is basically followup to the first Lawn Mower movie. The kid that we see in the first movie is now grown up, a hacker, and a kid whose life went downhill. Where is Pierce Bronson's character? Well guess the first movie sucks, why bother being in it then. As for the Jobe guy, wasn't he all stretched out thin in the first one? Well, anyways, this movie is like the terrible Robocop 3 where our future is bleak, corporate has their own little military and its a dirty homeless city setting of a movie. Be warn, this movie is just a time filler if you're looking to waste time or as someone said earlier, a movie to scare your inlaws out the door. Its on comcast now if those who have an account can watch it.

    I am rather amused at all the people here, who seem to hate on this movie just because its not exactly the same to Lawnmower man, or bash on it for the "Barely there plot". Well, growing up on horror flicks like I did, I can honestly say this HAS A plot, its just everyone's looking for some schlocky sci-fi plot and missing the real one. In a nutshell the plot is pretty simplistic, Jobe is a cripple, def and Dumb, who's brain has been hardwired to every computer in the world, after spending a life time crippled, and helpless he now has COMPLETE control, and absolute power, or near it. Jobe now wants to take over the world, and keep every single person in his cyber-world, and its up to the two Scientist doctors, and the male leads hacker minions, to try and stop them. Its a fairly schlocky, straight forward plot. A big turn on about this movie, is the Special Effects, a lot of people seem to be saying their "Bad" but considering the era this movie was made in, their decent. Tron it is not. But it's not on par with plan 9 from outer space either. The actors deliver a variable performance, nothing really stands out, or draws away. The actor playing Jobe is rather creepy, and genuinely gives off that "off his nut, power hungry" personification up until the end. All in all, this movie was a fairly straight forward run, more about the special effects then the plot, and simply didn't hold up well to the tests of time. The only bit that confused me in the least, was the "Pyramid" or "Egypt" analogy.

    In the 1980s and 90s, two huge problems were big in films. The first I would like to call the "Spielberg" clich&eacute;. That's where the world is saved by sensitive and all-knowing children. While governments, scientists and the like do their thing, the REAL geniuses (kids with a home computer in this case) save humanity! Ugghhh!! Second, there is the film makers' notion that says special effects can take the place of plot. However, rarely have I seen a film with such a bizarre and incomprehensible plot and such wonderful graphics--it's like a story wasn't even important to the film. What WAS important was lots and lots and lots of computer tricks and explosions--with graphics that were brilliant for 1996--but did nothing to create a movie worth seeing or understanding. It's as if they were making a film for people too dumb to want any plot! The plot, such as it is, is about some smart disabled guy who is using his &uuml;ber-brain to tie into all the world computers and mess with people--killing them in various ways that are super-graphics intensive. And, of course, it's up to a bunch of kids (and a down-and-out Patrick Bergen who must have been desperate for work) to save everyone. Is this really the best they could do?! Well it's obvious that I think this is a bad and vacuous film. However, is it bad enough to merit the inclusion on IMDb's Bottom 100 list? Well, that's not an easy answer and I should talk about the confusion in putting any film on the list. I guess it all depends on how you personally would interpret a bad film and what should be on the list. For example, the films of Ed Wood and Al Adamson are abysmal low-budget messes and yet they are not on the list. Perhaps this is because in their own weird way, they are so bad that they are funny. Or, perhaps because they are so low-budget they shouldn't be taken seriously. "Lawnmower Man 2" is clearly nothing like these films--with a relatively large budget (despite some bargain basement actors) and wider release than an Ed Wood film, it clearly is in a different league. And, sadly, while bad, it isn't what I would consider fun viewing. And, considering the sheer waste of money (i.e., "bang for the buck") and unwatchability, I would consider putting it on this infamous list. Pretty too look at mindless brain-rotting mush--that's MY interpretation of what should be on the list--and this clearly is brain-rotting mush!!

    My brother has repressed the memory of this film. I remain traumatized. Why would anyone make a movie like this and release it? Do they hate people? What are they going to do for an encore? Kick the homeless? Steal from the food shelves? This movie is terrible. Not in the so bad it is good way. This movie should not be viewed by anyone - ever. The plot is incoherent - acting wooden and has more holes in the plot than swiss cheese. I think this film can kill puppies, club seals, slash the rain forest, throw kittens in the river, oils penguins. I'm going to get a roofalate and see if I can forget this movie.

    Yes, it may be one of the worst films ever made, yes its incredibly dated, but it still has the futurama appeal of the 1st movie however, unlike the first this is far less intellectual (not to say V1 was), but since a couple things in this wont come to pass for a couple years now, i reaken the best time to watch this would be somewhere around 2011 on a computer hooked up to a pair of those $1000 glasses with a projector built in while using something like the emotive headset (google it before you cry n00b)instead of a mouse. But then again, since it's more of a cheap CGI/blue screen version of the Die Hard series rather than an intelligent forerunner to the Matrix like the first, i'm inclined to say this is more akin to a 1996 vinegar than to the 1992 port-noir the original was.

    Jobe is resuscitated by Jonathan Walker, and he wants Jobe to create a special computer chip that would connect all the computers in the world into one network. Walker would control and use the system, But he doesn't realise a group of teenage hackers, and Patrick Bergin, are on to him and out to stop his plan. He also doesn't realise that Jobe is now the bloke from The Taking Of Beverly Hills and not Jeff Fahey...... What is there to say? Yes the film is bad, there is no real explanation as to why Jobe is a I've, but he is, and when he's in cyber world, he turns into some strange Jim Carrey wannabe hybrid. The plot is silly, narrative is all over the place, and the cast know its ridiculous, but blimey Charlie, its a lot of fun to watch. The effects are really bad, even worse than Spawn, and Bergin looks totally bemused to be in this, its long way from the time he starred in that Robin Hood movie that didn't star Kevin Costner. Fewer really overacts, and despite his attempts to be menacing, he's just too camp, and becomes the reason why the film is so funny. Its rubbish, but its entertaining rubbish, but I cannot give it a rather higher than a four, because it is a fundamentally bad film, but not bottom 100 worthy. Plus its the best film ever to come as a special feature on the originals DVD.

    The original film is awful and so is this obnoxious sequel, which scores points for improving ever so slightly on its predecessor but loses them again for being so devoid of potential that even Jeff Fahey said no thanks - and look at some of the rubbish he's made. (How great was he in 'Lost', though?) Matt Frewer replaces him as the computer-enhanced genius who's now floating around in cyberspace with a desire to take over the real world. Trying to stop him are Austin O'Brien, forgotten child actor returning from the first movie, and Patrick Bergin, whose career's seen better days. With a trashy script, a story which barely fills the eighty-five minute running time and performances which rarely rise above the level of shite, the movie's left with nothing to wow you bar its beloved VR segments, and they're nothing special. The plot jumps ahead of itself so often it soon becomes clear that huge chunks of the movie have been hacked out, so there's something to be thankful for.

    The first 15 minutes or so of Lawnmowerman 2 were just utterly confusing. There is a man caught in cyberspace, an exploding building, paraplegic undergoing rehab and sudden jump to the future, all in a confused jumble. At this point I actually went online to check that I got the right movie, I was surprised to learn that I did. Once the initial confusion has settled down a bit you can get into the story proper which is only slight more watchable than the messed up intro. We have a bunch of kids in "the future" fighting against a crippled evil genius trying to control cyberspace, and all of it is clad in a super cheesy mid 90's aesthetic. It's kind of like "The Matrix" but for kids; with jargon like 'information super highway' and a dumb plot it feels both dated and inane. And it's not even cheesy enough to be funny. There is no point in commenting on acting, directing and so on, none of it matters with a film like this.

    This is not so much a review as it is to the confession of a crime; a tale of theft, an unreturned VHS-tape, left at the rental-return but not properly shoved into the slot and having taking said film home to be watched for free. See, it was the middle of the night, the shop long closed and the label of said videotape said "Lawnmover Man 2". Having been a huge fan of the first part, I couldn't resist crabbing the tape, dragging it home and shoving it into the player. Even acquired a litre of plonk wine (back then favoured by impoverished students) to celebrate the joyous occasion of finally seeing a sequel. The plonk didn't help it, the bottle empty before the second half of the film, upon which I ended this farce and pressed first the "stop", then the "eject" bottom. Returned the VHS to said return-slot the same night, not wanting have it at home and fearing that a trash bin would reject the tape. And, if whoever had to pay late-fees for this tape happens to read this review: consider this the price of an education. One doesn't rent crap like that! No points from me and the obligatory one point that IMDb gives it.

    Oh deal, just when we though Hollywood was recently going down the tube, this movie popped up in the Comcast on-demand option. Nothing beats watching movies free or for a fraction of buying the disc or renting it on netflick. This movie is basically followup to the first Lawn Mower movie. The kid that we see in the first movie is now grown up, a hacker, and a kid whose life went downhill. Where is Pierce Bronson's character? Well guess the first movie sucks, why bother being in it then. As for the Jobe guy, wasn't he all stretched out thin in the first one? Well, anyways, this movie is like the terrible Robocop 3 where our future is bleak, corporate has their own little military and its a dirty homeless city setting of a movie. Be warn, this movie is just a time filler if you're looking to waste time or as someone said earlier, a movie to scare your inlaws out the door. Its on comcast now if those who have an account can watch it.

    I am rather amused at all the people here, who seem to hate on this movie just because its not exactly the same to Lawnmower man, or bash on it for the "Barely there plot". Well, growing up on horror flicks like I did, I can honestly say this HAS A plot, its just everyone's looking for some schlocky sci-fi plot and missing the real one. In a nutshell the plot is pretty simplistic, Jobe is a cripple, def and Dumb, who's brain has been hardwired to every computer in the world, after spending a life time crippled, and helpless he now has COMPLETE control, and absolute power, or near it. Jobe now wants to take over the world, and keep every single person in his cyber-world, and its up to the two Scientist doctors, and the male leads hacker minions, to try and stop them. Its a fairly schlocky, straight forward plot. A big turn on about this movie, is the Special Effects, a lot of people seem to be saying their "Bad" but considering the era this movie was made in, their decent. Tron it is not. But it's not on par with plan 9 from outer space either. The actors deliver a variable performance, nothing really stands out, or draws away. The actor playing Jobe is rather creepy, and genuinely gives off that "off his nut, power hungry" personification up until the end. All in all, this movie was a fairly straight forward run, more about the special effects then the plot, and simply didn't hold up well to the tests of time. The only bit that confused me in the least, was the "Pyramid" or "Egypt" analogy.

    In the 1980s and 90s, two huge problems were big in films. The first I would like to call the "Spielberg" clich&eacute;. That's where the world is saved by sensitive and all-knowing children. While governments, scientists and the like do their thing, the REAL geniuses (kids with a home computer in this case) save humanity! Ugghhh!! Second, there is the film makers' notion that says special effects can take the place of plot. However, rarely have I seen a film with such a bizarre and incomprehensible plot and such wonderful graphics--it's like a story wasn't even important to the film. What WAS important was lots and lots and lots of computer tricks and explosions--with graphics that were brilliant for 1996--but did nothing to create a movie worth seeing or understanding. It's as if they were making a film for people too dumb to want any plot! The plot, such as it is, is about some smart disabled guy who is using his &uuml;ber-brain to tie into all the world computers and mess with people--killing them in various ways that are super-graphics intensive. And, of course, it's up to a bunch of kids (and a down-and-out Patrick Bergen who must have been desperate for work) to save everyone. Is this really the best they could do?! Well it's obvious that I think this is a bad and vacuous film. However, is it bad enough to merit the inclusion on IMDb's Bottom 100 list? Well, that's not an easy answer and I should talk about the confusion in putting any film on the list. I guess it all depends on how you personally would interpret a bad film and what should be on the list. For example, the films of Ed Wood and Al Adamson are abysmal low-budget messes and yet they are not on the list. Perhaps this is because in their own weird way, they are so bad that they are funny. Or, perhaps because they are so low-budget they shouldn't be taken seriously. "Lawnmower Man 2" is clearly nothing like these films--with a relatively large budget (despite some bargain basement actors) and wider release than an Ed Wood film, it clearly is in a different league. And, sadly, while bad, it isn't what I would consider fun viewing. And, considering the sheer waste of money (i.e., "bang for the buck") and unwatchability, I would consider putting it on this infamous list. Pretty too look at mindless brain-rotting mush--that's MY interpretation of what should be on the list--and this clearly is brain-rotting mush!!

    My brother has repressed the memory of this film. I remain traumatized. Why would anyone make a movie like this and release it? Do they hate people? What are they going to do for an encore? Kick the homeless? Steal from the food shelves? This movie is terrible. Not in the so bad it is good way. This movie should not be viewed by anyone - ever. The plot is incoherent - acting wooden and has more holes in the plot than swiss cheese. I think this film can kill puppies, club seals, slash the rain forest, throw kittens in the river, oils penguins. I'm going to get a roofalate and see if I can forget this movie.

    Yes, it may be one of the worst films ever made, yes its incredibly dated, but it still has the futurama appeal of the 1st movie however, unlike the first this is far less intellectual (not to say V1 was), but since a couple things in this wont come to pass for a couple years now, i reaken the best time to watch this would be somewhere around 2011 on a computer hooked up to a pair of those $1000 glasses with a projector built in while using something like the emotive headset (google it before you cry n00b)instead of a mouse. But then again, since it's more of a cheap CGI/blue screen version of the Die Hard series rather than an intelligent forerunner to the Matrix like the first, i'm inclined to say this is more akin to a 1996 vinegar than to the 1992 port-noir the original was.

Fewer really overacts, and despite his attempts to be menacing, he's just too camp, and becomes the reason why the film is so funny. Its rubbish, but its entertaining rubbish, but I cannot give it a rather higher than a four, because it is a fundamentally bad film, but not bottom 100 worthy. Plus its the best film ever to come as a special feature on the originals DVD.

    The original film is awful and so is this obnoxious sequel, which scores points for improving ever so slightly on its predecessor but loses them again for being so devoid of potential that even Jeff Fahey said no thanks - and look at some of the rubbish he's made. (How great was he in 'Lost', though?) Matt Frewer replaces him as the computer-enhanced genius who's now floating around in cyberspace with a desire to take over the real world. Trying to stop him are Austin O'Brien, forgotten child actor returning from the first movie, and Patrick Bergin, whose career's seen better days. With a trashy script, a story which barely fills the eighty-five minute running time and performances which rarely rise above the level of shite, the movie's left with nothing to wow you bar its beloved VR segments, and they're nothing special. The plot jumps ahead of itself so often it soon becomes clear that huge chunks of the movie have been hacked out, so there's something to be thankful for.

    The first 15 minutes or so of Lawnmowerman 2 were just utterly confusing. There is a man caught in cyberspace, an exploding building, paraplegic undergoing rehab and sudden jump to the future, all in a confused jumble. At this point I actually went online to check that I got the right movie, I was surprised to learn that I did. Once the initial confusion has settled down a bit you can get into the story proper which is only slight more watchable than the messed up intro. We have a bunch of kids in "the future" fighting against a crippled evil genius trying to control cyberspace, and all of it is clad in a super cheesy mid 90's aesthetic. It's kind of like "The Matrix" but for kids; with jargon like 'information super highway' and a dumb plot it feels both dated and inane. And it's not even cheesy enough to be funny. There is no point in commenting on acting, directing and so on, none of it matters with a film like this.

    This is not so much a review as it is to the confession of a crime; a tale of theft, an unreturned VHS-tape, left at the rental-return but not properly shoved into the slot and having taking said film home to be watched for free. See, it was the middle of the night, the shop long closed and the label of said videotape said "Lawnmover Man 2". Having been a huge fan of the first part, I couldn't resist crabbing the tape, dragging it home and shoving it into the player. Even acquired a litre of plonk wine (back then favoured by impoverished students) to celebrate the joyous occasion of finally seeing a sequel. The plonk didn't help it, the bottle empty before the second half of the film, upon which I ended this farce and pressed first the "stop", then the "eject" bottom. Returned the VHS to said return-slot the same night, not wanting have it at home and fearing that a trash bin would reject the tape. And, if whoever had to pay late-fees for this tape happens to read this review: consider this the price of an education. One doesn't rent crap like that! No points from me and the obligatory one point that IMDb gives it.

    Oh deal, just when we though Hollywood was recently going down the tube, this movie popped up in the Comcast on-demand option. Nothing beats watching movies free or for a fraction of buying the disc or renting it on netflick. This movie is basically followup to the first Lawn Mower movie. The kid that we see in the first movie is now grown up, a hacker, and a kid whose life went downhill. Where is Pierce Bronson's character? Well guess the first movie sucks, why bother being in it then. As for the Jobe guy, wasn't he all stretched out thin in the first one? Well, anyways, this movie is like the terrible Robocop 3 where our future is bleak, corporate has their own little military and its a dirty homeless city setting of a movie. Be warn, this movie is just a time filler if you're looking to waste time or as someone said earlier, a movie to scare your inlaws out the door. Its on comcast now if those who have an account can watch it.

    I am rather amused at all the people here, who seem to hate on this movie just because its not exactly the same to Lawnmower man, or bash on it for the "Barely there plot". Well, growing up on horror flicks like I did, I can honestly say this HAS A plot, its just everyone's looking for some schlocky sci-fi plot and missing the real one. In a nutshell the plot is pretty simplistic, Jobe is a cripple, def and Dumb, who's brain has been hardwired to every computer in the world, after spending a life time crippled, and helpless he now has COMPLETE control, and absolute power, or near it. Jobe now wants to take over the world, and keep every single person in his cyber-world, and its up to the two Scientist doctors, and the male leads hacker minions, to try and stop them. Its a fairly schlocky, straight forward plot. A big turn on about this movie, is the Special Effects, a lot of people seem to be saying their "Bad" but considering the era this movie was made in, their decent. Tron it is not. But it's not on par with plan 9 from outer space either. The actors deliver a variable performance, nothing really stands out, or draws away. The actor playing Jobe is rather creepy, and genuinely gives off that "off his nut, power hungry" personification up until the end. All in all, this movie was a fairly straight forward run, more about the special effects then the plot, and simply didn't hold up well to the tests of time. The only bit that confused me in the least, was the "Pyramid" or "Egypt" analogy.

    In the 1980s and 90s, two huge problems were big in films. The first I would like to call the "Spielberg" clich&eacute;. That's where the world is saved by sensitive and all-knowing children. While governments, scientists and the like do their thing, the REAL geniuses (kids with a home computer in this case) save humanity! Ugghhh!! Second, there is the film makers' notion that says special effects can take the place of plot. However, rarely have I seen a film with such a bizarre and incomprehensible plot and such wonderful graphics--it's like a story wasn't even important to the film. What WAS important was lots and lots and lots of computer tricks and explosions--with graphics that were brilliant for 1996--but did nothing to create a movie worth seeing or understanding. It's as if they were making a film for people too dumb to want any plot! The plot, such as it is, is about some smart disabled guy who is using his &uuml;ber-brain to tie into all the world computers and mess with people--killing them in various ways that are super-graphics intensive. And, of course, it's up to a bunch of kids (and a down-and-out Patrick Bergen who must have been desperate for work) to save everyone. Is this really the best they could do?! Well it's obvious that I think this is a bad and vacuous film. However, is it bad enough to merit the inclusion on IMDb's Bottom 100 list? Well, that's not an easy answer and I should talk about the confusion in putting any film on the list. I guess it all depends on how you personally would interpret a bad film and what should be on the list. For example, the films of Ed Wood and Al Adamson are abysmal low-budget messes and yet they are not on the list. Perhaps this is because in their own weird way, they are so bad that they are funny. Or, perhaps because they are so low-budget they shouldn't be taken seriously. "Lawnmower Man 2" is clearly nothing like these films--with a relatively large budget (despite some bargain basement actors) and wider release than an Ed Wood film, it clearly is in a different league. And, sadly, while bad, it isn't what I would consider fun viewing. And, considering the sheer waste of money (i.e., "bang for the buck") and unwatchability, I would consider putting it on this infamous list. Pretty too look at mindless brain-rotting mush--that's MY interpretation of what should be on the list--and this clearly is brain-rotting mush!!

    My brother has repressed the memory of this film. I remain traumatized. Why would anyone make a movie like this and release it? Do they hate people? What are they going to do for an encore? Kick the homeless? Steal from the food shelves? This movie is terrible. Not in the so bad it is good way. This movie should not be viewed by anyone - ever. The plot is incoherent - acting wooden and has more holes in the plot than swiss cheese. I think this film can kill puppies, club seals, slash the rain forest, throw kittens in the river, oils penguins. I'm going to get a roofalate and see if I can forget this movie.

    Yes, it may be one of the worst films ever made, yes its incredibly dated, but it still has the futurama appeal of the 1st movie however, unlike the first this is far less intellectual (not to say V1 was), but since a couple things in this wont come to pass for a couple years now, i reaken the best time to watch this would be somewhere around 2011 on a computer hooked up to a pair of those $1000 glasses with a projector built in while using something like the emotive headset (google it before you cry n00b)instead of a mouse. But then again, since it's more of a cheap CGI/blue screen version of the Die Hard series rather than an intelligent forerunner to the Matrix like the first, i'm inclined to say this is more akin to a 1996 vinegar than to the 1992 port-noir the original was.

    Jobe is resuscitated by Jonathan Walker, and he wants Jobe to create a special computer chip that would connect all the computers in the world into one network. Walker would control and use the system, But he doesn't realise a group of teenage hackers, and Patrick Bergin, are on to him and out to stop his plan. He also doesn't realise that Jobe is now the bloke from The Taking Of Beverly Hills and not Jeff Fahey...... What is there to say? Yes the film is bad, there is no real explanation as to why Jobe is a I've, but he is, and when he's in cyber world, he turns into some strange Jim Carrey wannabe hybrid. The plot is silly, narrative is all over the place, and the cast know its ridiculous, but blimey Charlie, its a lot of fun to watch.

    The first 15 minutes or so of Lawnmowerman 2 were just utterly confusing. There is a man caught in cyberspace, an exploding building, paraplegic undergoing rehab and sudden jump to the future, all in a confused jumble. At this point I actually went online to check that I got the right movie, I was surprised to learn that I did. Once the initial confusion has settled down a bit you can get into the story proper which is only slight more watchable than the messed up intro. We have a bunch of kids in "the future" fighting against a crippled evil genius trying to control cyberspace, and all of it is clad in a super cheesy mid 90's aesthetic. It's kind of like "The Matrix" but for kids; with jargon like 'information super highway' and a dumb plot it feels both dated and inane. And it's not even cheesy enough to be funny. There is no point in commenting on acting, directing and so on, none of it matters with a film like this.

    This is not so much a review as it is to the confession of a crime; a tale of theft, an unreturned VHS-tape, left at the rental-return but not properly shoved into the slot and having taking said film home to be watched for free. See, it was the middle of the night, the shop long closed and the label of said videotape said "Lawnmover Man 2". Having been a huge fan of the first part, I couldn't resist crabbing the tape, dragging it home and shoving it into the player. Even acquired a litre of plonk wine (back then favoured by impoverished students) to celebrate the joyous occasion of finally seeing a sequel. The plonk didn't help it, the bottle empty before the second half of the film, upon which I ended this farce and pressed first the "stop", then the "eject" bottom. Returned the VHS to said return-slot the same night, not wanting have it at home and fearing that a trash bin would reject the tape. And, if whoever had to pay late-fees for this tape happens to read this review: consider this the price of an education. One doesn't rent crap like that! No points from me and the obligatory one point that IMDb gives it.

    Oh deal, just when we though Hollywood was recently going down the tube, this movie popped up in the Comcast on-demand option. Nothing beats watching movies free or for a fraction of buying the disc or renting it on netflick. This movie is basically followup to the first Lawn Mower movie. The kid that we see in the first movie is now grown up, a hacker, and a kid whose life went downhill. Where is Pierce Bronson's character? Well guess the first movie sucks, why bother being in it then. As for the Jobe guy, wasn't he all stretched out thin in the first one? Well, anyways, this movie is like the terrible Robocop 3 where our future is bleak, corporate has their own little military and its a dirty homeless city setting of a movie. Be warn, this movie is just a time filler if you're looking to waste time or as someone said earlier, a movie to scare your inlaws out the door. Its on comcast now if those who have an account can watch it.

    I am rather amused at all the people here, who seem to hate on this movie just because its not exactly the same to Lawnmower man, or bash on it for the "Barely there plot". Well, growing up on horror flicks like I did, I can honestly say this HAS A plot, its just everyone's looking for some schlocky sci-fi plot and missing the real one. In a nutshell the plot is pretty simplistic, Jobe is a cripple, def and Dumb, who's brain has been hardwired to every computer in the world, after spending a life time crippled, and helpless he now has COMPLETE control, and absolute power, or near it. Jobe now wants to take over the world, and keep every single person in his cyber-world, and its up to the two Scientist doctors, and the male leads hacker minions, to try and stop them. Its a fairly schlocky, straight forward plot. A big turn on about this movie, is the Special Effects, a lot of people seem to be saying their "Bad" but considering the era this movie was made in, their decent. Tron it is not. But it's not on par with plan 9 from outer space either. The actors deliver a variable performance, nothing really stands out, or draws away. The actor playing Jobe is rather creepy, and genuinely gives off that "off his nut, power hungry" personification up until the end. All in all, this movie was a fairly straight forward run, more about the special effects then the plot, and simply didn't hold up well to the tests of time. The only bit that confused me in the least, was the "Pyramid" or "Egypt" analogy.

    In the 1980s and 90s, two huge problems were big in films. The first I would like to call the "Spielberg" clich&eacute;. That's where the world is saved by sensitive and all-knowing children. While governments, scientists and the like do their thing, the REAL geniuses (kids with a home computer in this case) save humanity! Ugghhh!! Second, there is the film makers' notion that says special effects can take the place of plot. However, rarely have I seen a film with such a bizarre and incomprehensible plot and such wonderful graphics--it's like a story wasn't even important to the film. What WAS important was lots and lots and lots of computer tricks and explosions--with graphics that were brilliant for 1996--but did nothing to create a movie worth seeing or understanding. It's as if they were making a film for people too dumb to want any plot! The plot, such as it is, is about some smart disabled guy who is using his &uuml;ber-brain to tie into all the world computers and mess with people--killing them in various ways that are super-graphics intensive. And, of course, it's up to a bunch of kids (and a down-and-out Patrick Bergen who must have been desperate for work) to save everyone. Is this really the best they could do?! Well it's obvious that I think this is a bad and vacuous film. However, is it bad enough to merit the inclusion on IMDb's Bottom 100 list? Well, that's not an easy answer and I should talk about the confusion in putting any film on the list. I guess it all depends on how you personally would interpret a bad film and what should be on the list. For example, the films of Ed Wood and Al Adamson are abysmal low-budget messes and yet they are not on the list. Perhaps this is because in their own weird way, they are so bad that they are funny. Or, perhaps because they are so low-budget they shouldn't be taken seriously. "Lawnmower Man 2" is clearly nothing like these films--with a relatively large budget (despite some bargain basement actors) and wider release than an Ed Wood film, it clearly is in a different league. And, sadly, while bad, it isn't what I would consider fun viewing. And, considering the sheer waste of money (i.e., "bang for the buck") and unwatchability, I would consider putting it on this infamous list. Pretty too look at mindless brain-rotting mush--that's MY interpretation of what should be on the list--and this clearly is brain-rotting mush!!

    My brother has repressed the memory of this film. I remain traumatized. Why would anyone make a movie like this and release it? Do they hate people? What are they going to do for an encore? Kick the homeless? Steal from the food shelves? This movie is terrible. Not in the so bad it is good way. This movie should not be viewed by anyone - ever. The plot is incoherent - acting wooden and has more holes in the plot than swiss cheese. I think this film can kill puppies, club seals, slash the rain forest, throw kittens in the river, oils penguins. I'm going to get a roofalate and see if I can forget this movie.

    Yes, it may be one of the worst films ever made, yes its incredibly dated, but it still has the futurama appeal of the 1st movie however, unlike the first this is far less intellectual (not to say V1 was), but since a couple things in this wont come to pass for a couple years now, i reaken the best time to watch this would be somewhere around 2011 on a computer hooked up to a pair of those $1000 glasses with a projector built in while using something like the emotive headset (google it before you cry n00b)instead of a mouse. But then again, since it's more of a cheap CGI/blue screen version of the Die Hard series rather than an intelligent forerunner to the Matrix like the first, i'm inclined to say this is more akin to a 1996 vinegar than to the 1992 port-noir the original was.
