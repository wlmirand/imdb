    We're back in the Great Valley again, and this time the haven is disrupted when the water that feeds it stops flowing. Instead of trying to discover the cause, all the dinosaurs argue and look on as their beloved valley dries up and catches fire. No wonder this lot died out. Eventually another quest plot kicks in and an avalanche of parental advice and anti-bullying sentiment ensues, with the soppy moralising about sharing and working together more than living up to the film's nauseating title. It's all very well-intentioned, I guess, but the cutesy-poo tone and irritating characters ensure there's nothing to engage any adults nagged into watching it.

    Winning Best Home Video Presentation of the 1995 Annies, "The Time of the Great Giving" is the third installment of the Land Before Time series. For some reason, it was originally supposed to be #4, but was pushed forward one year. Maybe Roy Allen Smith just wanted to save best for last. One way or another, this is still a great addition to the franchise. The film begins in a similar way to the opening of the first movie, with the same sweeping score and the same calm note, underwater. The animation's cool wavy effects and the silent ancient creatures give a great feel for the setting to those who are starting the series with this installment. In the Great Valley, Littlefoot, Cera, Petrie, Ducky, and Spike have constantly been getting bullied by a trio of adolescent dinosaurs: a hypsilophodon named Hyp, a nodosaurus named Nod, and a muttaburrasaurus named Mutt. So on this evening, a meteor shower impacts near the Great Valley and causes an explosion in the Mysterious Beyond. Fortunately, no one is injured severely. But the next day, the Great Valley dinosaurs wake up to find the Thundering Falls, their main supply of water, drying up. The increasing lack of water causes conflicts between the adults. Considering his species the wisest (even singing a whole song about it), Cera's dad is insistent that he make the drinking arrangements. He becomes so conceited that he gets unreasonable. In fact, he accuses Littlefoot of wasting water when he gets sprayed by a splash caused by the bullies, who hightail it out of there to not be noticed. Despite the fact that the gang had no knowledge of the water problem, Cera's dad cites Littlefoot as a bad influence and forbids Cera to be around him. To bring an end to all the bickering, Cera sneaks out with the others to set out on a water hunt of their own. One of the most graphically stunning sequences in the movie, the animation of this wildfire fire that spreads through the Great Valley is dazzling and the score is appropriately alarming for the situation, sounding much like that of the Firebird stage from Fantasia 2000. "Kids Like Us", is the best song in the movie. While the other two have great instrumentals, their lyrics aren't very top notch. This one is very meaningful, if somewhat preachy, and hopefully will show children how to deal with bullying. The only real issue with this movie is that it kind of makes it seem like children are always the ones with the solution to a problem while the adults are just helpless and argumentative. This movie could have benefited more by encouraging children to always seek adults' help. Even so, it's better than "The Great Valley Adventure", as it deals with the grown ups as much as the kids, and it offers great messages for both children and parents of cooperation and preventing bullying. The storyline, though formulaic, is pretty well-developed, and though the kids' dialogue is juvenile, that isn't so much a bad thing when working with characters who are still very young. Kids will be kids. The action scenes are sufficiently entertaining, the animation is outstanding, and Michael Tavera's score is most beautiful here, making for a fine addition to the Land Before Time canon. 8/10 for "The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving".

    Even though the second film lacked the heart of the original which was in my opinion one of Bluth's best films, it was pretty passable with it's nice animation and some decent villains. While I think that this is an improvement over The Great Valley Adventure, it also lacks the heart of the original. The story about the value of friendship, teamwork, and sharing was a nice idea and I think that it has some very nice dialog with such hilarious quotes including "Me go play bullies somewhere else" and "Me unscareable". The animation is beautiful with some lovely colors, but also has some flat backgrounds due to it's below average editing. The songs, although not great, are very pleasant to listen too. The strongest aspects is the wonderful music from Michael Travera and it's excellent voice acting. Scott McAfee did very decent as Littlefoot and his singing was pretty good. I also liked Linda Gary and Kenneth Mars as Littlefoot's grandparents. John Ingle's narration was clunky, but Cera's father's gruff characterization really amused me. Overall, while an improvement on the Great Valley Adventure, it doesn't have the heart of the original, but it's still worth watching.

    The first Land Before Time movie is a masterpiece as far as animated movies go, and this second sequel is pretty good. The third installment in the Land Before Time series is good, however, it somewhat begins to decline with this one, and continues with the long series of sequels after this one. I used to be an enormous fan of the series, but now that I am older, I have been able to analyze them more, and although I still do enjoy a few of them, the sequels were pretty unnecessary, as while some of them were enjoyable, they don't give the edge that the original masterpiece did so right. One positive thing I have to note, is that the animation is surprisingly good for a movie that was released straight to video. Also, there is some humor in the movie, and I enjoyed it for the funny parts. However, if I had to love a film, it would be the original, as that one is dark and has some sad moments to it, and it has some humor in it. In contrast to the dark tones of the original, the series began to get more childish and eventually the childishness brought about the sequelitis. This pretty good, but definitely not as good as the classic and marvelous original. On the short note, this film is pretty good, but it could have been so much better. I'm not saying that I hated it, because I didn't hate it, I enjoyed it, but I probably would have enjoyed it much more if they would have made it more like the original, darker and edgier instead of lighter and softer. Oh well, this is good on the whole, although it is definitely nowhere near as great as the original. I'll give this seven out of ten, that means that while this is not a bad film, it could have been better if it would have been dark and edgy, much like the classic original. 7/10

    I thought the 3RD Land Before Time movie was a great sequel to the first and second movies. In this adventure Littlefoot and his friends must find water after the water dries up in the Great Valley and they must deal with dinosaur bullies Hyp, Mutt, and Nod. I think this sequel was the best out of all the Land Before Time. I loved the dinosaur bullies especially Mutt because he was the one who was really slow and dumb witted and his friends would always have to get him to agree with them and he would say Oh! Uh yeah! Pretty funney! I also liked their song When You're Big! Pretty cool Bully song! I also liked the song Cera's Dad sang Stand Tough! John Ingle sang it pretty good! Also the boy who provided the voice of Littlefoot did a good job singing Kids Like Us which I thought was good in teaching about giving kids especially bullies another chance at being good kids! Filled with great animation, story, and music Land Before Time III Time of the Great Giving is a perfect sequel any Land Before Time fans can enjoy 10 out of 10!

    First of all, I do think it is an improvement on Land Before Time 2, which was passable, but lacked heart, which was what made the original so poignant. The Time of the Great Giving is probably the best of the countless sequels that border from good to unwatchable, but suffers from being too preachy at times. The animation is surprisingly good, but isn't quite true to the style of animation in the original. In most scenes it had some lovely colours, but had some flat backgrounds in others. The incidental music by Michael Tavera was excellent, especially the Firebird-like music in the fire scene. It was nice to hear the heart-rending main theme from the original, but whereas in the original it made me weep buckets, it didn't have an effect on me here. The songs are okay, Kids Like Us being the best one, and Littlefoot's singing voice is for once pretty decent, but the other two songs When You're Big and When You're Standing Tough came across as rather unmelodious. The story is a very nice idea, about the values of friendship, survival and sticking together. There is also some nice dialogue, but the film further suffers from being too short and being devoid of any real emotion. I will say that the voice talents were very impressive. Ducky is still funny, with similar dialogue we associate her with from the original, though it doesn't quite feel the same without the sweetness and vulnerability of the original voice actress, the late Judith Barsi. Scott McAfee is decent as Littlefoot, and I liked Linda Gary and Kenneth Mars as the grandparents. However, in correlation to the original, John Ingle's narration, as nice as it was, was somewhat unnecessary, but I was more impressed with his gruff characterisation of Cera's father. All in all, a surprisingly good sequel, though it doesn't surpass the first and the finest. 6/10 Bethany Cox.

    The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving of course is the third installment into the Land Before Time story. When I got the opportunity to see all the sequels, I definitely took up on it, even though these sequels are given such a hard time, I'm still curious what they were about. I do love just a nice little family movie every once in a while, something light hearted and an occasional laugh. Now the second Land Before Time movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting, so I went into the third installment with good hope. Now it's definitely to as good as the first or second Land Before Time, but it's still enjoyable and something that I'm sure your kids will enjoy. Littlefoot and his friends are constantly being bullied and browbeaten by three teenage dinosaurs: Hyp, Nod, and Mutt. However, when a shower of meteorites impacts near the Great Valley and causes a rock slide in the Mysterious Beyond, which blocks the water supply of the Great Valley, Hyp, Nod, and Mutt are no longer the biggest worry of Littlefoot and his friends. The increasing lack of water causes conflicts between the inhabitants of the Great Valley, who have lived in relative peace and harmony until this event. When the interspecies situation becomes worse and worse, Littlefoot and the others set out to find water, to keep the peace in the Great Valley. They are pursued by Hyp and his friends. When Littlefoot and the others find a small lake, the teenagers emerge and claim the waterhole for themselves, demanding that Littlefoot and the others keep silent about their discovery. Unwilling to comply, Littlefoot and the others flee from the bullies and during the following pursuit discover the reason for the blockage of the Great Valley's water source. Before they can return and tell the other Valley inhabitants the truth, a lightning strike ignites a wildfire that spreads rapidly through the dried Valley. The dinosaurs barely make it to safety at the edge of the Mysterious Beyond while the fire ravages their home. When the protagonists tell the other dinosaurs of their discovery of the water's being blocked in the Mysterious Beyond by the rock slide, disunity about what to do prevents the adult dinosaurs from doing anything to utilize this knowledge. Hyp, Mutt, and Nod set out into the Mysterious Beyond on their own to get to the water first. But Littlefoot and his friends are on their tails to find a way for them to share the water with the rest of the Valley. Over all The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving is a good movie, it's worth the watch for the kids, but is made more so for them rather than the adults to join in on it as well, but it's all good. Littlefoot and his friends are still a joy to watch on the screen as they get into these new adventures. So far these sequels are really not as bad as everyone says they are so I am looking forward to watching the fourth installment of the Land Before Time series, they're cute for the kids. 5/10

    Genre: Animated film about dinosaurs and a major water catastrophe. What happens: In the Great valley for the gang, there are TWO annoying problems (unfortunately, not one or none). There are three bully dinosaurs who are CONSTANTLY picking on the poor good dinosaurs and to top all the depression, the waterfall in the Great Valley has stopped flowing. Though the lovely gang (Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky Petrie and Spike) are sad and annoyed, they have a positive view as well over this mess and decide to work together to find water My thoughts: I like most of the L.B.T films. Unfortunately, this one is not at the top of my list for me. It is just too depressing! All the songs focus on some bad thing or other, unlike in all the films, where at least one focuses on just happiness! It also concentrates on the crisis of the film WAY too much for my liking. The music sticks to the depressing tune for 75% of the film, everyone is EXTRA grumpy because of the crisis and it's just too annoying! When there IS happiness, it feels deflated, like rather floppy balloon, it just isn't STRONG enough. Luckily, I prefer this film to "Land Before Time 11", which is my least favourite L.B.T, but this one is still not NEARLY as good as most of the others for me. I know lots of other people like it, but for me, it's just too depressing, too annoying, too deflated and too pessimistic. So there. I like the main characters of course. The new characters are not all that good, because they're bullies. Recommended to: People who like the eleventh L.B.T, people who find all the other L.B.T's too happy and jolly and people who do not mind becoming a little too depressed by an animated film.

    Roy Allen Smith, who directed The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure, directs this beautifully magic movie with it's stunning graphics perfectly. Four actors/actresses have returned to voice the characters we have all fallen in love with. A huge meteor hits nearby the valley and causes a rock slide in the mysterious beyond that blocks the water supply to the valley. After this our favorite dinosaurs Littlefoot (Scott McAfee), Ducky (Heather Hogan), Petrie (Jeff Bennett), Cera (Candace Hutson) and spike are bullied by the bigger dinosaurs Hyp (Whit Hertford), Nod (Scott Menville) and Mutt (Jeff Bennett). After a few days the valley is thrown into turmoil as the water supply decreases. The bullying problems increase and then the gang discovers the cause for the shortage. Littlefoot and his friends follow Hyp and his friends into the mysterious beyond and saves the valley, after it was hit by a lightning bolt and lit on fire. The Time of the Great Giving shows what friendship, bullying and love can lead to. This is the second of the series to include songs; When You're Big, Standing Tough, Kids Like Us. I recommend for every family with children. This is a fun movie to watch for everyone, the young and the old.

    this is the best movie ever. i love the dinosaur, Hip (he is the cutest bully <3) "When You're Big" is the best song it's to the point, great for a sing along, and even somewhat obnoxious. what more in a groovy tune could you possibly need?? the movie, i of course bought the soundtrack me that Ms. Britney Spears. u cant gulp and slurp and swig. i also loved Standing Tough sung by Daddy Tops, it was just such a powerful song, it just made me wanna jump around the room and holler I'm tough.(after watching ck, and shared it with all my friends who just simply adored it as much as i did!) Back to the movie: it was about the dinosaurs running out of water in the great valley. it also shows how Littlefoot and the gang deal with big kids (aka bullies.)(i know, i know, yes its so awful, but don't worry, they make it into the perfect movie for the family or for just relaxing at home with your root beer and sunflower seeds)

    The first Land Before Time movie is a masterpiece as far as animated movies go, and this second sequel is pretty good. The third installment in the Land Before Time series is good, however, it somewhat begins to decline with this one, and continues with the long series of sequels after this one. I used to be an enormous fan of the series, but now that I am older, I have been able to analyze them more, and although I still do enjoy a few of them, the sequels were pretty unnecessary, as while some of them were enjoyable, they don't give the edge that the original masterpiece did so right. One positive thing I have to note, is that the animation is surprisingly good for a movie that was released straight to video. Also, there is some humor in the movie, and I enjoyed it for the funny parts. However, if I had to love a film, it would be the original, as that one is dark and has some sad moments to it, and it has some humor in it. In contrast to the dark tones of the original, the series began to get more childish and eventually the childishness brought about the sequelitis. This pretty good, but definitely not as good as the classic and marvelous original. On the short note, this film is pretty good, but it could have been so much better. I'm not saying that I hated it, because I didn't hate it, I enjoyed it, but I probably would have enjoyed it much more if they would have made it more like the original, darker and edgier instead of lighter and softer. Oh well, this is good on the whole, although it is definitely nowhere near as great as the original. I'll give this seven out of ten, that means that while this is not a bad film, it could have been better if it would have been dark and edgy, much like the classic original. 7/10

    I thought the 3RD Land Before Time movie was a great sequel to the first and second movies. In this adventure Littlefoot and his friends must find water after the water dries up in the Great Valley and they must deal with dinosaur bullies Hyp, Mutt, and Nod. I think this sequel was the best out of all the Land Before Time. I loved the dinosaur bullies especially Mutt because he was the one who was really slow and dumb witted and his friends would always have to get him to agree with them and he would say Oh! Uh yeah! Pretty funney! I also liked their song When You're Big! Pretty cool Bully song! I also liked the song Cera's Dad sang Stand Tough! John Ingle sang it pretty good! Also the boy who provided the voice of Littlefoot did a good job singing Kids Like Us which I thought was good in teaching about giving kids especially bullies another chance at being good kids! Filled with great animation, story, and music Land Before Time III Time of the Great Giving is a perfect sequel any Land Before Time fans can enjoy 10 out of 10!

    First of all, I do think it is an improvement on Land Before Time 2, which was passable, but lacked heart, which was what made the original so poignant. The Time of the Great Giving is probably the best of the countless sequels that border from good to unwatchable, but suffers from being too preachy at times. The animation is surprisingly good, but isn't quite true to the style of animation in the original. In most scenes it had some lovely colours, but had some flat backgrounds in others. The incidental music by Michael Tavera was excellent, especially the Firebird-like music in the fire scene. It was nice to hear the heart-rending main theme from the original, but whereas in the original it made me weep buckets, it didn't have an effect on me here. The songs are okay, Kids Like Us being the best one, and Littlefoot's singing voice is for once pretty decent, but the other two songs When You're Big and When You're Standing Tough came across as rather unmelodious. The story is a very nice idea, about the values of friendship, survival and sticking together. There is also some nice dialogue, but the film further suffers from being too short and being devoid of any real emotion. I will say that the voice talents were very impressive. Ducky is still funny, with similar dialogue we associate her with from the original, though it doesn't quite feel the same without the sweetness and vulnerability of the original voice actress, the late Judith Barsi. Scott McAfee is decent as Littlefoot, and I liked Linda Gary and Kenneth Mars as the grandparents. However, in correlation to the original, John Ingle's narration, as nice as it was, was somewhat unnecessary, but I was more impressed with his gruff characterisation of Cera's father. All in all, a surprisingly good sequel, though it doesn't surpass the first and the finest. 6/10 Bethany Cox.

    The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving of course is the third installment into the Land Before Time story. When I got the opportunity to see all the sequels, I definitely took up on it, even though these sequels are given such a hard time, I'm still curious what they were about. I do love just a nice little family movie every once in a while, something light hearted and an occasional laugh. Now the second Land Before Time movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting, so I went into the third installment with good hope. Now it's definitely to as good as the first or second Land Before Time, but it's still enjoyable and something that I'm sure your kids will enjoy. Littlefoot and his friends are constantly being bullied and browbeaten by three teenage dinosaurs: Hyp, Nod, and Mutt. However, when a shower of meteorites impacts near the Great Valley and causes a rock slide in the Mysterious Beyond, which blocks the water supply of the Great Valley, Hyp, Nod, and Mutt are no longer the biggest worry of Littlefoot and his friends. The increasing lack of water causes conflicts between the inhabitants of the Great Valley, who have lived in relative peace and harmony until this event. When the interspecies situation becomes worse and worse, Littlefoot and the others set out to find water, to keep the peace in the Great Valley. They are pursued by Hyp and his friends. When Littlefoot and the others find a small lake, the teenagers emerge and claim the waterhole for themselves, demanding that Littlefoot and the others keep silent about their discovery. Unwilling to comply, Littlefoot and the others flee from the bullies and during the following pursuit discover the reason for the blockage of the Great Valley's water source. Before they can return and tell the other Valley inhabitants the truth, a lightning strike ignites a wildfire that spreads rapidly through the dried Valley. The dinosaurs barely make it to safety at the edge of the Mysterious Beyond while the fire ravages their home. When the protagonists tell the other dinosaurs of their discovery of the water's being blocked in the Mysterious Beyond by the rock slide, disunity about what to do prevents the adult dinosaurs from doing anything to utilize this knowledge. Hyp, Mutt, and Nod set out into the Mysterious Beyond on their own to get to the water first. But Littlefoot and his friends are on their tails to find a way for them to share the water with the rest of the Valley. Over all The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving is a good movie, it's worth the watch for the kids, but is made more so for them rather than the adults to join in on it as well, but it's all good. Littlefoot and his friends are still a joy to watch on the screen as they get into these new adventures. So far these sequels are really not as bad as everyone says they are so I am looking forward to watching the fourth installment of the Land Before Time series, they're cute for the kids. 5/10

    Genre: Animated film about dinosaurs and a major water catastrophe. What happens: In the Great valley for the gang, there are TWO annoying problems (unfortunately, not one or none). There are three bully dinosaurs who are CONSTANTLY picking on the poor good dinosaurs and to top all the depression, the waterfall in the Great Valley has stopped flowing. Though the lovely gang (Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky Petrie and Spike) are sad and annoyed, they have a positive view as well over this mess and decide to work together to find water My thoughts: I like most of the L.B.T films. Unfortunately, this one is not at the top of my list for me. It is just too depressing! All the songs focus on some bad thing or other, unlike in all the films, where at least one focuses on just happiness! It also concentrates on the crisis of the film WAY too much for my liking. The music sticks to the depressing tune for 75% of the film, everyone is EXTRA grumpy because of the crisis and it's just too annoying! When there IS happiness, it feels deflated, like rather floppy balloon, it just isn't STRONG enough. Luckily, I prefer this film to "Land Before Time 11", which is my least favourite L.B.T, but this one is still not NEARLY as good as most of the others for me. I know lots of other people like it, but for me, it's just too depressing, too annoying, too deflated and too pessimistic. So there. I like the main characters of course. The new characters are not all that good, because they're bullies. Recommended to: People who like the eleventh L.B.T, people who find all the other L.B.T's too happy and jolly and people who do not mind becoming a little too depressed by an animated film.

    Roy Allen Smith, who directed The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure, directs this beautifully magic movie with it's stunning graphics perfectly. Four actors/actresses have returned to voice the characters we have all fallen in love with. A huge meteor hits nearby the valley and causes a rock slide in the mysterious beyond that blocks the water supply to the valley. After this our favorite dinosaurs Littlefoot (Scott McAfee), Ducky (Heather Hogan), Petrie (Jeff Bennett), Cera (Candace Hutson) and spike are bullied by the bigger dinosaurs Hyp (Whit Hertford), Nod (Scott Menville) and Mutt (Jeff Bennett). After a few days the valley is thrown into turmoil as the water supply decreases. The bullying problems increase and then the gang discovers the cause for the shortage. Littlefoot and his friends follow Hyp and his friends into the mysterious beyond and saves the valley, after it was hit by a lightning bolt and lit on fire. The Time of the Great Giving shows what friendship, bullying and love can lead to. This is the second of the series to include songs; When You're Big, Standing Tough, Kids Like Us. I recommend for every family with children. This is a fun movie to watch for everyone, the young and the old.

    this is the best movie ever. i love the dinosaur, Hip (he is the cutest bully <3) "When You're Big" is the best song it's to the point, great for a sing along, and even somewhat obnoxious. what more in a groovy tune could you possibly need?? the movie, i of course bought the soundtrack me that Ms. Britney Spears. u cant gulp and slurp and swig. i also loved Standing Tough sung by Daddy Tops, it was just such a powerful song, it just made me wanna jump around the room and holler I'm tough.(after watching ck, and shared it with all my friends who just simply adored it as much as i did!) Back to the movie: it was about the dinosaurs running out of water in the great valley. it also shows how Littlefoot and the gang deal with big kids (aka bullies.)(i know, i know, yes its so awful, but don't worry, they make it into the perfect movie for the family or for just relaxing at home with your root beer and sunflower seeds)
