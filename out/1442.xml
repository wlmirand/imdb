    I can ensure you that The Scarlet Letter receives too much negative criticism. It's an easy target. I've never read the novel though I wish I did read it so I could better effectively rate the movie, but the book is great so the movie has big shoes to fill. The Scarlet Letter is clearly a fine film. Its direct comparisons to the book is one big reason for all the underratings, another big reason is The Scarlet Letter viewing sells itself as some great movie, with its vivid storytelling, its great acting and strong cinematography, yet it's not quite great. It's hard and difficult to deliver a pure dramatic period piece based on a strong selling novel. The movie may supposed to be sophisticated, elegant drama, but The Scarlet Letter quickly settles into a regular on the surface movie at the time when Authur and Hester meet, not being too artistically poetic, but more commonly driven by its desires. The Scarlet Letter is lost between those two film modes with no seaming connection. Another strong critique is it's missing very intriguing plot points. All this lessens the film, but not all so much. The Scarlet Letter is a passionate romance taking place in a beautiful though turbulent setting. It has a good, deep cast. Demi Moore and Gary Oldman as Hester Prynne and Authur Dimmsdale make The Scarlet Letter good all while their characters engage in forbidden lust. Moore and Oldman offer tour de forces in The Scarlet Letter. Moore is beauty at its finest. I love Demi Moore and Gary Oldman, two my favorite and two of the very best. I quite enjoy their impassioned performances in The Scarlet Letter. It may make the characters themselves slightly exaggerated, but Oldman and Moore do a good job of maintaining it. I wouldn't change it if I could. The Scarlet Letter is a great tragic love story in the form of a good movie. I must say, The Scarlet Letter is really good, and anyone who bashes it as bad is being too harsh. It's a strong 6. The Scarlet Letter is a great stay at home couples date night movie because it's boldly, desperately romantic and you do not have to watch it too closely to follow it as it speaks of pure passion being very passionately compelling.

    I generally dislike movie critics because I have really liked many movies they pan and I've not liked some movies they extolled. I think all of performances in The Scarlet Letter were spot on. Demi's portrayal of a woman taking a stand against rigid moral codes and repression of women was very well done. She avoided being too strident trying to walk the hard line between the mores of the 1700's and following the demands of her heart and body in her love for Rev. Dimmesdale. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors and I've never seen him give a bad performance. The tight control he's trying to keep when he's so in love and lusting after Hester is a wonder to watch. The Reverend's place in his church, his community and his faith is turned upside down putting his life in jeopardy preventing him from doing what he knows is right in speaking up to defend his love and claim his child. The scene in the barn when Hester and Arthur finally consummate their love is one of the most sensual and beautifully filmed love scenes I've ever seen. Since I love happier endings, I'm glad they took poetic license and did not strictly adhere to the book.

    This certainly ranks among the Top Ten of "What Were They Thinking?" films ever made. The production is sumptuously photographed, has a more than qualified director in Oscar nominee Roland Joffe, a recognizable supporting cast of Oscar luminaries featuring Gary Oldman, Robert Duvall and Joan Plowright, and a then-bankable leading lady in Demi Moore. Factor in the pedigree associated with Nathaniel Hawthorne's legendary novel and something far more worthwhile should have been the end result. Moore is cast as Hester Prynne, a proper Puritan wife sent ahead to the colonies to prepare a home for she and her husband. Emboldened by the new responsibilities thrust upon her and some of the new relationships she starts, Hester gives in to an attraction to the righteous Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Oldman) when it is believed that her husband has perished in an Indian massacre. Hester's peccadillo and her subsequent illegitimate pregnancy cause her to become persona non grata in the colony and she is forced to wear the scarlet letter of the title brandishing her an adulterer. Anyone who made it through high school is familiar with the tale of Hester Prynne, but given the issues inherent in the material and how it still remains pertinent in today's society with women's right being trampled on, its cinematic adaptations have been amazingly rare. So it is doubly unfortunate that Joffe and company have so succinctly bungled this effort. Moore is pretty as a picture, but entirely too contemporary a presence to convince as Hester. She provides neither the insight nor the range to make Hester's plight palpable. Oldman is solid and provides a titillating full frontal voyeuristic skinny-dip, but his role is beyond ridiculous (more on that later). Robert Duvall as Hester's wacko husband shows up later in the film and gives the worst performance of his career. This is so bad it is akin to the work Nick Nolte contributed in Hulk. And pretty much everyone is out-acted by a bird that seems to be chirping for sexual freedom. The film's biggest problem and the result of its failure is that it fails to have respect or even understand the entire point of the source. No one feels that Joffe needs to be slavishly faithful to Hawthorne's prose. And sexing the material up for modern audiences is also not an unwise call. However, what is absurd is basically castrating the story of its core. Joffe and company take the window dressing of the Scarlett Letter, but abandon its entire reason for being. Hawthorne's story was an indictment of Puritanism and the hypocrisy of Christianity in that Reverend Dimmesdale was a self-righteous blowhard stirring up his foolish flock and leading the charge against Hester by day, while being her lover at night and demanding she keep their secret. If anything, he is the villain of the piece, yet the film version somehow re-imagines him as a worthwhile, misunderstood romantic figure! Instead of Dimmesdale being depicted justly as a craven, cowardly monument of hypocrisy, we instead get Dimmesdale as the Puritan answer to Fabio and Duvall gets to usurp the villain role as Hester's wild-eyed madman hubby. This shift in narrative, plus changes in the latter half of the film including the ending, completely abandons the entire purpose of Hawthorne's tale. Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such, the film does not conclude, so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.

    I was completely shocked after watching The Scarlet Letter to find such strong negative criticism towards it. 4.7 on IMDb? 14% on rotten tomatoes? nominated for several Razzies?? But why? The only possible answer I can come up with is that this film is largely being critiqued by Hawthorne Puritans, so to speak. And truly, to say that this adaptation strays from the book is like saying that the Kardashians sometimes appear in the media. It does take liberties, and several key plot points have been changed - but does that make it a BAD MOVIE? I have read the Scarlet Letter, and I can see the appeal, but it's not as if it was without it's flaws. It needed some back-story. The characters needed more likability. There needed to be a greater depth to the relationships. This movie gave it all of that with the added bonus of giving it a more exciting story line. The novel aside, this movie was absolutely gorgeous in every aspect. The sets, score, and costuming were top quality, and really transported me into 17th century New England. The acting was stunning throughout the cast, with Demi Moore portraying a strong, enduring Hester Prynn, Robert Duvall giving a thoroughly chilling performance as her husband, and Gary Oldman managing to transform Reverend Dimmesdale - a horribly weak and unlikeable character in the book - into a charming and extremely complex man that the audience could sympathize with. There is nothing that this movie didn't have that most Oscar nominated hits have as well. The only flaws I can think of were, and this is a stretch, the excessive amounts of nudity (which on Mr. Oldman's part were actually very welcome), and the fact that the feminist attitudes were slightly anachronistic. But again, does this make The Scarlet Letter bad? I don't think so. The people I saw it with didn't think so. I honestly don't understand how anyone COULD think so. (and I here I though comprehending God was going to be my biggest challenge) So I say go ahead and watch The Scarlet Letter. Just don't turn it on expecting a word-for-word rendition of the book because you will be disappointed. Instead, expect a beautiful, high-quality, high-intensity romantic thrill ride that deserves a much better reception than it received.

    Nope, this film is NOT an accurate adaptation of "The Scarlet Letter" by any stretch of the imagination. It's more like a modern "Variations on a Theme by Nathaniel Hawthorne," or one of those Fantasias that 19th- century composers used to write with a famous, much-older melody as a starting point. That said, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The depiction of late 18th/early 19th century Native American civilization on the Northeastern Seaboard is vividly and richly imagined; don't think I've ever seen this in a film before. Gary Oldman, as a wonderfully sexy and yet perfectly pure young Rev. Dimmesdale, probably would have pleased Hawthorne on the whole, and his chemistry with Demi Moore's obviously anachronistic, but compelling, Hester Prynne is delicious (their scene in the barn is very hot indeed). Finally, something has to be said about the gorgeous John Barry score. What lovely, memorable film music! On the strength of the score alone, I encourage anyone who enjoys romantic stories (and won't be offended by the vast, ridiculous departures from Hawthorne's masterpiece) to give this movie a look.

    I love this movie , Demi Moore's portrayal of Hawthorne's character. From his classic novel was excellent, as the woman who had committed the carnal sin of adultery. And was considered a harlot and a witch. For not only did she have an affair , brought on by feelings of lust and desire. But it was with a Holy man sworn to be loyal and faithful to only the Lord our savior. Which was considered forbidden , so as her punishment she was forced to wear the scarlet letter 'A'. Which stood for adulteress, But she when found out she was with child. And out of wedlock she had only two options , neither one was promising. In the end she had only 4 options be hung, burned , end her affair with the Priest (Oldman) which was forced to leave the church. And her final choice leave with her child and never comeback! Great move fantastic acting ! Due to certain controversial content this movie isn't for everyone! But for anyone who appreciates classic literature this is the movie for you!

    I have noticed that most of the bad reviews for "The Scarlet Letter" are written by lovers of Nathaniel Hawthorn's classic novel of the same name. I myself have read the novel, and I appreciated it as much as the next person, but let's be realistic here; is it really made for the screen? Director Roland Joffe has done the right thing here by adding some extra *umph* to the classic story with the right dose of action and romance - even if many key elements of the novel were altered. First, let's put this into perspective. Yes, Joffe took the title of the book, hinting towards a relatively accurate adaption, which it was not by any means. However, there have been many successful films based on novels that have even used the author's name directly in the title whilst making it just as inaccurate. Example 1: Bram Stoker's Dracula - also starring the wonderful Gary Oldman - TOTALLY strayed from the book but is still a favourite of many. #2: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Complete filth in my opinion (possibly because Frankenstein's my fav book and Ken Branagh is just such a ham in it), but it was still approved by most critics. Get what I'm saying here? Just because a film is not word-for-word like the book it's based on, it doesn't mean that it isn't any good. Truth be told, I love this film! Yes, yes, I'm a bit of a Gary Oldman fan girl, and yes, seeing his wet, naked, beautiful body made me swoon, but that is NOT the only reason why I loved this film. Honest. Despite the incredible length, Scarlet Letter managed to grab my attention from start to finish. The soundtrack, lighting, costuming, sets, camera work, script . . . it was all fantastic. It had me smiling and giggling at the flirty exchanges between Arthur (Gary Oldman) and Hester (Demi Moore), sighing at the love scenes, biting my nails at the moments where those crazy Puritans showed their (arguably) evil side,reaching for tissues at the tragic moments, and had me actually hiding my face behind a pillow when things got really intense. This to me is the mark of a great film. Another great thing is the performances. The entire cast was incredible - a thing that rarely happens. The stars of the film, Moore and Oldman, were both critically knocked for their performances - Gary for not being 'into the role' and Demi for just, well, sucking. NONSENSE!! Gary, while not in his usual bada$$ and over-the-top crazy element, played the charming and romantic version of Dimmesdale to a T. He really let us feel his torment in having to choose between his moral and spiritual beliefs, and his heart (and I can't stress enough how beautiful he is in this role - okay, hormones are settled now). Demi was equally as wonderful, showing us both the strength of a woman seeking independence from domestic and religious restraints, as well as vulnerability in her inability to actually "fight the power" so to speak. Both actors had amazing chemistry and passion - passion for their individual beliefs, for their child, and above all, for each other. Simply wonderful. Another stand-out performance was Joan Plowright as Harriot. She portrayed a gentle, warm and kind wisdom like I have never seen before. I felt immediately drawn to her character. *drum roll* Time for the one and only flaw! My main problem is the unnecessary amounts of gore. I won't say how it's gory, but if you haven't seen this yet, consider yourself warned. I understand that this is a device that only makes the film more powerful and intense, but truthfully, it's just plain hard to watch. OH! I just thought of another flaw. Mituba diddling herself with a candlestick. It might sound like a bad Clue scenario, but lo and behold . . . It's just unnecessary. So those are my two cents. If you're a hard-knock fan of the book, try to forget about it when watching this film. It really is great as an independent story, so just let your mind relax and sink into the creative depths of the directors' interpretation. And keep a pillow handy.

    I am not going to keep on comparing here, but this film as a film and an adaptation is a mess in my opinion. The book is one of the greatest American novels, and is so interesting and thoughtfully written. The film version of The Scarlet Letter does have exquisite costumes, scenery and cinematography, a lush John Barry score and despite the inconsistent accent and a slight need to over-compensate Gary Oldman is surprisingly credible as Dimmersdale. However, the script is trite and the storytelling is uninteresting, has little heart and has some overly-gratuitous scenes such as the bathing scene. The pace is also uneven, some of it is too quick while other scenes are ponderous and stilted. The direction feels lacking, and you know there's something wrong when Oldman gives the only half-decent performance. I love Edward Hardwicke and Joan Plowright but they have awful dialogue and their characters are not written well at all. Robert Duvall is embarrassing here, and that pained me to say that as he is usually brilliant. Worst of all is Demi Moore, I don't hate Moore as much as some do(I liked her very much in Ghost, A Few Good Men and The Hunchback of Notre Dame) but she is very bland and not very believable at all as Hester. Overall, disappointing and a failure film and adaptation-wise. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    This is one of the worst major-studio literary adaptations ever, and I've given it a 1 rating because it deserves to be in the IMDb bottom 100--though in terms of (unintentionally hilarious) entertainment value I'd give it a 6. Maybe even an 8. I'm no huge fan of Hawthorne--his novels are pretty dry, dull and moralistic, like much pre-20th-century American lit--but his whole story is outrageously skewed here to suit Demi Moore's ego. She was at the top of her stardom then. This, "G.I. Jane" and "Striptease" pretty much destroyed that status--and all because each of them was wrecked by the need to flatter her so much. She needs to be the toughest yet most sensitive, sexiest yet most spiritual, etc. etc. person on screen--which would be OK if she were playing an action heroine or female superhero, but was disastrous for these particular stories. "G.I. Jane" could have been a gritty look at women's military life, "Striptease" has considerable sequences--all without Demi--where it's a very funny retro screwball comedy. But her humorless image-sculpting ruined both. Then there's "Scarlet Letter." Whoa. Roland Joffe is not a good director (despite having gotten praise for the fairly good "Killing Fields" and overrated "The Mission"--since then it's been all downhill). But the problem here is clearly that Demi wants to reshape Hester Prynne from Puritan victim of Puritanism into a hot ass-kicking, erotically supercharged mama who connects as a kindred soul with local Native Americans and hosts a sort of women's consciousness-raising/sewing group. In colonial New England. Uh-huh. I kinda love this movie--it's so slick yet incredibly wrongheaded, encouraging possibly the worst performances ever by some very good actors (Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall for starters), that it's frequently hilarious. It's one of those rare crazy monuments to a star's ego--at the expense of any fidelity or credibility--that results in an instant camp classic.

    I have never read Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th century novel, but apparently this is total rape and murder of it. Admittedly Demi Moore's Hester is extremely irritating, like all of the movie's strrrooong women, and celebration of adultery would make poor, Victorian Nathaniel turn scarlet too, but production values are lush and the film is not without entertainment value. Think, for example, the hysterical scene where Hester (or whoever this modern woman among Puritans is) puts wreath of flowers to her head and runs in the woods like 17th century hippie! She is free spirit in narrow-minded, bigoted society, get it? As filmed version of Historical Harlequin book this is not bad at all, as Hawthorne adaptation it is, of course, insulting travesty and understandably angered book's fans.

It does take liberties, and several key plot points have been changed - but does that make it a BAD MOVIE? I have read the Scarlet Letter, and I can see the appeal, but it's not as if it was without it's flaws. It needed some back-story. The characters needed more likability. There needed to be a greater depth to the relationships. This movie gave it all of that with the added bonus of giving it a more exciting story line. The novel aside, this movie was absolutely gorgeous in every aspect. The sets, score, and costuming were top quality, and really transported me into 17th century New England. The acting was stunning throughout the cast, with Demi Moore portraying a strong, enduring Hester Prynn, Robert Duvall giving a thoroughly chilling performance as her husband, and Gary Oldman managing to transform Reverend Dimmesdale - a horribly weak and unlikeable character in the book - into a charming and extremely complex man that the audience could sympathize with. There is nothing that this movie didn't have that most Oscar nominated hits have as well. The only flaws I can think of were, and this is a stretch, the excessive amounts of nudity (which on Mr. Oldman's part were actually very welcome), and the fact that the feminist attitudes were slightly anachronistic. But again, does this make The Scarlet Letter bad? I don't think so. The people I saw it with didn't think so. I honestly don't understand how anyone COULD think so. (and I here I though comprehending God was going to be my biggest challenge) So I say go ahead and watch The Scarlet Letter. Just don't turn it on expecting a word-for-word rendition of the book because you will be disappointed. Instead, expect a beautiful, high-quality, high-intensity romantic thrill ride that deserves a much better reception than it received.

    Nope, this film is NOT an accurate adaptation of "The Scarlet Letter" by any stretch of the imagination. It's more like a modern "Variations on a Theme by Nathaniel Hawthorne," or one of those Fantasias that 19th- century composers used to write with a famous, much-older melody as a starting point. That said, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The depiction of late 18th/early 19th century Native American civilization on the Northeastern Seaboard is vividly and richly imagined; don't think I've ever seen this in a film before. Gary Oldman, as a wonderfully sexy and yet perfectly pure young Rev. Dimmesdale, probably would have pleased Hawthorne on the whole, and his chemistry with Demi Moore's obviously anachronistic, but compelling, Hester Prynne is delicious (their scene in the barn is very hot indeed). Finally, something has to be said about the gorgeous John Barry score. What lovely, memorable film music! On the strength of the score alone, I encourage anyone who enjoys romantic stories (and won't be offended by the vast, ridiculous departures from Hawthorne's masterpiece) to give this movie a look.

    I love this movie , Demi Moore's portrayal of Hawthorne's character. From his classic novel was excellent, as the woman who had committed the carnal sin of adultery. And was considered a harlot and a witch. For not only did she have an affair , brought on by feelings of lust and desire. But it was with a Holy man sworn to be loyal and faithful to only the Lord our savior. Which was considered forbidden , so as her punishment she was forced to wear the scarlet letter 'A'. Which stood for adulteress, But she when found out she was with child. And out of wedlock she had only two options , neither one was promising. In the end she had only 4 options be hung, burned , end her affair with the Priest (Oldman) which was forced to leave the church. And her final choice leave with her child and never comeback! Great move fantastic acting ! Due to certain controversial content this movie isn't for everyone! But for anyone who appreciates classic literature this is the movie for you!

    I have noticed that most of the bad reviews for "The Scarlet Letter" are written by lovers of Nathaniel Hawthorn's classic novel of the same name. I myself have read the novel, and I appreciated it as much as the next person, but let's be realistic here; is it really made for the screen? Director Roland Joffe has done the right thing here by adding some extra *umph* to the classic story with the right dose of action and romance - even if many key elements of the novel were altered. First, let's put this into perspective. Yes, Joffe took the title of the book, hinting towards a relatively accurate adaption, which it was not by any means. However, there have been many successful films based on novels that have even used the author's name directly in the title whilst making it just as inaccurate. Example 1: Bram Stoker's Dracula - also starring the wonderful Gary Oldman - TOTALLY strayed from the book but is still a favourite of many. #2: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Complete filth in my opinion (possibly because Frankenstein's my fav book and Ken Branagh is just such a ham in it), but it was still approved by most critics. Get what I'm saying here? Just because a film is not word-for-word like the book it's based on, it doesn't mean that it isn't any good. Truth be told, I love this film! Yes, yes, I'm a bit of a Gary Oldman fan girl, and yes, seeing his wet, naked, beautiful body made me swoon, but that is NOT the only reason why I loved this film. Honest. Despite the incredible length, Scarlet Letter managed to grab my attention from start to finish. The soundtrack, lighting, costuming, sets, camera work, script . . . it was all fantastic. It had me smiling and giggling at the flirty exchanges between Arthur (Gary Oldman) and Hester (Demi Moore), sighing at the love scenes, biting my nails at the moments where those crazy Puritans showed their (arguably) evil side,reaching for tissues at the tragic moments, and had me actually hiding my face behind a pillow when things got really intense. This to me is the mark of a great film. Another great thing is the performances. The entire cast was incredible - a thing that rarely happens. The stars of the film, Moore and Oldman, were both critically knocked for their performances - Gary for not being 'into the role' and Demi for just, well, sucking. NONSENSE!! Gary, while not in his usual bada$$ and over-the-top crazy element, played the charming and romantic version of Dimmesdale to a T. He really let us feel his torment in having to choose between his moral and spiritual beliefs, and his heart (and I can't stress enough how beautiful he is in this role - okay, hormones are settled now). Demi was equally as wonderful, showing us both the strength of a woman seeking independence from domestic and religious restraints, as well as vulnerability in her inability to actually "fight the power" so to speak. Both actors had amazing chemistry and passion - passion for their individual beliefs, for their child, and above all, for each other. Simply wonderful. Another stand-out performance was Joan Plowright as Harriot. She portrayed a gentle, warm and kind wisdom like I have never seen before. I felt immediately drawn to her character. *drum roll* Time for the one and only flaw! My main problem is the unnecessary amounts of gore. I won't say how it's gory, but if you haven't seen this yet, consider yourself warned. I understand that this is a device that only makes the film more powerful and intense, but truthfully, it's just plain hard to watch. OH! I just thought of another flaw. Mituba diddling herself with a candlestick. It might sound like a bad Clue scenario, but lo and behold . . . It's just unnecessary. So those are my two cents. If you're a hard-knock fan of the book, try to forget about it when watching this film. It really is great as an independent story, so just let your mind relax and sink into the creative depths of the directors' interpretation. And keep a pillow handy.

    I am not going to keep on comparing here, but this film as a film and an adaptation is a mess in my opinion. The book is one of the greatest American novels, and is so interesting and thoughtfully written. The film version of The Scarlet Letter does have exquisite costumes, scenery and cinematography, a lush John Barry score and despite the inconsistent accent and a slight need to over-compensate Gary Oldman is surprisingly credible as Dimmersdale. However, the script is trite and the storytelling is uninteresting, has little heart and has some overly-gratuitous scenes such as the bathing scene. The pace is also uneven, some of it is too quick while other scenes are ponderous and stilted. The direction feels lacking, and you know there's something wrong when Oldman gives the only half-decent performance. I love Edward Hardwicke and Joan Plowright but they have awful dialogue and their characters are not written well at all. Robert Duvall is embarrassing here, and that pained me to say that as he is usually brilliant. Worst of all is Demi Moore, I don't hate Moore as much as some do(I liked her very much in Ghost, A Few Good Men and The Hunchback of Notre Dame) but she is very bland and not very believable at all as Hester. Overall, disappointing and a failure film and adaptation-wise. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    This is one of the worst major-studio literary adaptations ever, and I've given it a 1 rating because it deserves to be in the IMDb bottom 100--though in terms of (unintentionally hilarious) entertainment value I'd give it a 6. Maybe even an 8. I'm no huge fan of Hawthorne--his novels are pretty dry, dull and moralistic, like much pre-20th-century American lit--but his whole story is outrageously skewed here to suit Demi Moore's ego. She was at the top of her stardom then. This, "G.I. Jane" and "Striptease" pretty much destroyed that status--and all because each of them was wrecked by the need to flatter her so much. She needs to be the toughest yet most sensitive, sexiest yet most spiritual, etc. etc. person on screen--which would be OK if she were playing an action heroine or female superhero, but was disastrous for these particular stories. "G.I. Jane" could have been a gritty look at women's military life, "Striptease" has considerable sequences--all without Demi--where it's a very funny retro screwball comedy. But her humorless image-sculpting ruined both. Then there's "Scarlet Letter." Whoa. Roland Joffe is not a good director (despite having gotten praise for the fairly good "Killing Fields" and overrated "The Mission"--since then it's been all downhill). But the problem here is clearly that Demi wants to reshape Hester Prynne from Puritan victim of Puritanism into a hot ass-kicking, erotically supercharged mama who connects as a kindred soul with local Native Americans and hosts a sort of women's consciousness-raising/sewing group. In colonial New England. Uh-huh. I kinda love this movie--it's so slick yet incredibly wrongheaded, encouraging possibly the worst performances ever by some very good actors (Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall for starters), that it's frequently hilarious. It's one of those rare crazy monuments to a star's ego--at the expense of any fidelity or credibility--that results in an instant camp classic.

    I have never read Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th century novel, but apparently this is total rape and murder of it. Admittedly Demi Moore's Hester is extremely irritating, like all of the movie's strrrooong women, and celebration of adultery would make poor, Victorian Nathaniel turn scarlet too, but production values are lush and the film is not without entertainment value. Think, for example, the hysterical scene where Hester (or whoever this modern woman among Puritans is) puts wreath of flowers to her head and runs in the woods like 17th century hippie! She is free spirit in narrow-minded, bigoted society, get it? As filmed version of Historical Harlequin book this is not bad at all, as Hawthorne adaptation it is, of course, insulting travesty and understandably angered book's fans.

    I can ensure you that The Scarlet Letter receives too much negative criticism. It's an easy target. I've never read the novel though I wish I did read it so I could better effectively rate the movie, but the book is great so the movie has big shoes to fill. The Scarlet Letter is clearly a fine film. Its direct comparisons to the book is one big reason for all the underratings, another big reason is The Scarlet Letter viewing sells itself as some great movie, with its vivid storytelling, its great acting and strong cinematography, yet it's not quite great. It's hard and difficult to deliver a pure dramatic period piece based on a strong selling novel. The movie may supposed to be sophisticated, elegant drama, but The Scarlet Letter quickly settles into a regular on the surface movie at the time when Authur and Hester meet, not being too artistically poetic, but more commonly driven by its desires. The Scarlet Letter is lost between those two film modes with no seaming connection. Another strong critique is it's missing very intriguing plot points. All this lessens the film, but not all so much. The Scarlet Letter is a passionate romance taking place in a beautiful though turbulent setting. It has a good, deep cast. Demi Moore and Gary Oldman as Hester Prynne and Authur Dimmsdale make The Scarlet Letter good all while their characters engage in forbidden lust. Moore and Oldman offer tour de forces in The Scarlet Letter. Moore is beauty at its finest. I love Demi Moore and Gary Oldman, two my favorite and two of the very best. I quite enjoy their impassioned performances in The Scarlet Letter. It may make the characters themselves slightly exaggerated, but Oldman and Moore do a good job of maintaining it. I wouldn't change it if I could. The Scarlet Letter is a great tragic love story in the form of a good movie. I must say, The Scarlet Letter is really good, and anyone who bashes it as bad is being too harsh. It's a strong 6. The Scarlet Letter is a great stay at home couples date night movie because it's boldly, desperately romantic and you do not have to watch it too closely to follow it as it speaks of pure passion being very passionately compelling.

    I generally dislike movie critics because I have really liked many movies they pan and I've not liked some movies they extolled. I think all of performances in The Scarlet Letter were spot on. Demi's portrayal of a woman taking a stand against rigid moral codes and repression of women was very well done. She avoided being too strident trying to walk the hard line between the mores of the 1700's and following the demands of her heart and body in her love for Rev. Dimmesdale. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors and I've never seen him give a bad performance. The tight control he's trying to keep when he's so in love and lusting after Hester is a wonder to watch. The Reverend's place in his church, his community and his faith is turned upside down putting his life in jeopardy preventing him from doing what he knows is right in speaking up to defend his love and claim his child. The scene in the barn when Hester and Arthur finally consummate their love is one of the most sensual and beautifully filmed love scenes I've ever seen. Since I love happier endings, I'm glad they took poetic license and did not strictly adhere to the book.

    This certainly ranks among the Top Ten of "What Were They Thinking?" films ever made. The production is sumptuously photographed, has a more than qualified director in Oscar nominee Roland Joffe, a recognizable supporting cast of Oscar luminaries featuring Gary Oldman, Robert Duvall and Joan Plowright, and a then-bankable leading lady in Demi Moore. Factor in the pedigree associated with Nathaniel Hawthorne's legendary novel and something far more worthwhile should have been the end result. Moore is cast as Hester Prynne, a proper Puritan wife sent ahead to the colonies to prepare a home for she and her husband. Emboldened by the new responsibilities thrust upon her and some of the new relationships she starts, Hester gives in to an attraction to the righteous Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Oldman) when it is believed that her husband has perished in an Indian massacre. Hester's peccadillo and her subsequent illegitimate pregnancy cause her to become persona non grata in the colony and she is forced to wear the scarlet letter of the title brandishing her an adulterer. Anyone who made it through high school is familiar with the tale of Hester Prynne, but given the issues inherent in the material and how it still remains pertinent in today's society with women's right being trampled on, its cinematic adaptations have been amazingly rare. So it is doubly unfortunate that Joffe and company have so succinctly bungled this effort. Moore is pretty as a picture, but entirely too contemporary a presence to convince as Hester. She provides neither the insight nor the range to make Hester's plight palpable. Oldman is solid and provides a titillating full frontal voyeuristic skinny-dip, but his role is beyond ridiculous (more on that later). Robert Duvall as Hester's wacko husband shows up later in the film and gives the worst performance of his career. This is so bad it is akin to the work Nick Nolte contributed in Hulk. And pretty much everyone is out-acted by a bird that seems to be chirping for sexual freedom. The film's biggest problem and the result of its failure is that it fails to have respect or even understand the entire point of the source. No one feels that Joffe needs to be slavishly faithful to Hawthorne's prose. And sexing the material up for modern audiences is also not an unwise call. However, what is absurd is basically castrating the story of its core. Joffe and company take the window dressing of the Scarlett Letter, but abandon its entire reason for being. Hawthorne's story was an indictment of Puritanism and the hypocrisy of Christianity in that Reverend Dimmesdale was a self-righteous blowhard stirring up his foolish flock and leading the charge against Hester by day, while being her lover at night and demanding she keep their secret. If anything, he is the villain of the piece, yet the film version somehow re-imagines him as a worthwhile, misunderstood romantic figure! Instead of Dimmesdale being depicted justly as a craven, cowardly monument of hypocrisy, we instead get Dimmesdale as the Puritan answer to Fabio and Duvall gets to usurp the villain role as Hester's wild-eyed madman hubby. This shift in narrative, plus changes in the latter half of the film including the ending, completely abandons the entire purpose of Hawthorne's tale. Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such, the film does not conclude, so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.

    I was completely shocked after watching The Scarlet Letter to find such strong negative criticism towards it. 4.7 on IMDb? 14% on rotten tomatoes? nominated for several Razzies?? But why? The only possible answer I can come up with is that this film is largely being critiqued by Hawthorne Puritans, so to speak. And truly, to say that this adaptation strays from the book is like saying that the Kardashians sometimes appear in the media.

    This is one of the worst major-studio literary adaptations ever, and I've given it a 1 rating because it deserves to be in the IMDb bottom 100--though in terms of (unintentionally hilarious) entertainment value I'd give it a 6. Maybe even an 8. I'm no huge fan of Hawthorne--his novels are pretty dry, dull and moralistic, like much pre-20th-century American lit--but his whole story is outrageously skewed here to suit Demi Moore's ego. She was at the top of her stardom then. This, "G.I. Jane" and "Striptease" pretty much destroyed that status--and all because each of them was wrecked by the need to flatter her so much. She needs to be the toughest yet most sensitive, sexiest yet most spiritual, etc. etc. person on screen--which would be OK if she were playing an action heroine or female superhero, but was disastrous for these particular stories. "G.I. Jane" could have been a gritty look at women's military life, "Striptease" has considerable sequences--all without Demi--where it's a very funny retro screwball comedy. But her humorless image-sculpting ruined both. Then there's "Scarlet Letter." Whoa. Roland Joffe is not a good director (despite having gotten praise for the fairly good "Killing Fields" and overrated "The Mission"--since then it's been all downhill). But the problem here is clearly that Demi wants to reshape Hester Prynne from Puritan victim of Puritanism into a hot ass-kicking, erotically supercharged mama who connects as a kindred soul with local Native Americans and hosts a sort of women's consciousness-raising/sewing group. In colonial New England. Uh-huh. I kinda love this movie--it's so slick yet incredibly wrongheaded, encouraging possibly the worst performances ever by some very good actors (Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall for starters), that it's frequently hilarious. It's one of those rare crazy monuments to a star's ego--at the expense of any fidelity or credibility--that results in an instant camp classic.

    I have never read Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th century novel, but apparently this is total rape and murder of it. Admittedly Demi Moore's Hester is extremely irritating, like all of the movie's strrrooong women, and celebration of adultery would make poor, Victorian Nathaniel turn scarlet too, but production values are lush and the film is not without entertainment value. Think, for example, the hysterical scene where Hester (or whoever this modern woman among Puritans is) puts wreath of flowers to her head and runs in the woods like 17th century hippie! She is free spirit in narrow-minded, bigoted society, get it? As filmed version of Historical Harlequin book this is not bad at all, as Hawthorne adaptation it is, of course, insulting travesty and understandably angered book's fans.

    I can ensure you that The Scarlet Letter receives too much negative criticism. It's an easy target. I've never read the novel though I wish I did read it so I could better effectively rate the movie, but the book is great so the movie has big shoes to fill. The Scarlet Letter is clearly a fine film. Its direct comparisons to the book is one big reason for all the underratings, another big reason is The Scarlet Letter viewing sells itself as some great movie, with its vivid storytelling, its great acting and strong cinematography, yet it's not quite great. It's hard and difficult to deliver a pure dramatic period piece based on a strong selling novel. The movie may supposed to be sophisticated, elegant drama, but The Scarlet Letter quickly settles into a regular on the surface movie at the time when Authur and Hester meet, not being too artistically poetic, but more commonly driven by its desires. The Scarlet Letter is lost between those two film modes with no seaming connection. Another strong critique is it's missing very intriguing plot points. All this lessens the film, but not all so much. The Scarlet Letter is a passionate romance taking place in a beautiful though turbulent setting. It has a good, deep cast. Demi Moore and Gary Oldman as Hester Prynne and Authur Dimmsdale make The Scarlet Letter good all while their characters engage in forbidden lust. Moore and Oldman offer tour de forces in The Scarlet Letter. Moore is beauty at its finest. I love Demi Moore and Gary Oldman, two my favorite and two of the very best. I quite enjoy their impassioned performances in The Scarlet Letter. It may make the characters themselves slightly exaggerated, but Oldman and Moore do a good job of maintaining it. I wouldn't change it if I could. The Scarlet Letter is a great tragic love story in the form of a good movie. I must say, The Scarlet Letter is really good, and anyone who bashes it as bad is being too harsh. It's a strong 6. The Scarlet Letter is a great stay at home couples date night movie because it's boldly, desperately romantic and you do not have to watch it too closely to follow it as it speaks of pure passion being very passionately compelling.

    I generally dislike movie critics because I have really liked many movies they pan and I've not liked some movies they extolled. I think all of performances in The Scarlet Letter were spot on. Demi's portrayal of a woman taking a stand against rigid moral codes and repression of women was very well done. She avoided being too strident trying to walk the hard line between the mores of the 1700's and following the demands of her heart and body in her love for Rev. Dimmesdale. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors and I've never seen him give a bad performance. The tight control he's trying to keep when he's so in love and lusting after Hester is a wonder to watch. The Reverend's place in his church, his community and his faith is turned upside down putting his life in jeopardy preventing him from doing what he knows is right in speaking up to defend his love and claim his child. The scene in the barn when Hester and Arthur finally consummate their love is one of the most sensual and beautifully filmed love scenes I've ever seen. Since I love happier endings, I'm glad they took poetic license and did not strictly adhere to the book.

    This certainly ranks among the Top Ten of "What Were They Thinking?" films ever made. The production is sumptuously photographed, has a more than qualified director in Oscar nominee Roland Joffe, a recognizable supporting cast of Oscar luminaries featuring Gary Oldman, Robert Duvall and Joan Plowright, and a then-bankable leading lady in Demi Moore. Factor in the pedigree associated with Nathaniel Hawthorne's legendary novel and something far more worthwhile should have been the end result. Moore is cast as Hester Prynne, a proper Puritan wife sent ahead to the colonies to prepare a home for she and her husband. Emboldened by the new responsibilities thrust upon her and some of the new relationships she starts, Hester gives in to an attraction to the righteous Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Oldman) when it is believed that her husband has perished in an Indian massacre. Hester's peccadillo and her subsequent illegitimate pregnancy cause her to become persona non grata in the colony and she is forced to wear the scarlet letter of the title brandishing her an adulterer. Anyone who made it through high school is familiar with the tale of Hester Prynne, but given the issues inherent in the material and how it still remains pertinent in today's society with women's right being trampled on, its cinematic adaptations have been amazingly rare. So it is doubly unfortunate that Joffe and company have so succinctly bungled this effort. Moore is pretty as a picture, but entirely too contemporary a presence to convince as Hester. She provides neither the insight nor the range to make Hester's plight palpable. Oldman is solid and provides a titillating full frontal voyeuristic skinny-dip, but his role is beyond ridiculous (more on that later). Robert Duvall as Hester's wacko husband shows up later in the film and gives the worst performance of his career. This is so bad it is akin to the work Nick Nolte contributed in Hulk. And pretty much everyone is out-acted by a bird that seems to be chirping for sexual freedom. The film's biggest problem and the result of its failure is that it fails to have respect or even understand the entire point of the source. No one feels that Joffe needs to be slavishly faithful to Hawthorne's prose. And sexing the material up for modern audiences is also not an unwise call. However, what is absurd is basically castrating the story of its core. Joffe and company take the window dressing of the Scarlett Letter, but abandon its entire reason for being. Hawthorne's story was an indictment of Puritanism and the hypocrisy of Christianity in that Reverend Dimmesdale was a self-righteous blowhard stirring up his foolish flock and leading the charge against Hester by day, while being her lover at night and demanding she keep their secret. If anything, he is the villain of the piece, yet the film version somehow re-imagines him as a worthwhile, misunderstood romantic figure! Instead of Dimmesdale being depicted justly as a craven, cowardly monument of hypocrisy, we instead get Dimmesdale as the Puritan answer to Fabio and Duvall gets to usurp the villain role as Hester's wild-eyed madman hubby. This shift in narrative, plus changes in the latter half of the film including the ending, completely abandons the entire purpose of Hawthorne's tale. Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such, the film does not conclude, so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.

    I was completely shocked after watching The Scarlet Letter to find such strong negative criticism towards it. 4.7 on IMDb? 14% on rotten tomatoes? nominated for several Razzies?? But why? The only possible answer I can come up with is that this film is largely being critiqued by Hawthorne Puritans, so to speak. And truly, to say that this adaptation strays from the book is like saying that the Kardashians sometimes appear in the media. It does take liberties, and several key plot points have been changed - but does that make it a BAD MOVIE? I have read the Scarlet Letter, and I can see the appeal, but it's not as if it was without it's flaws. It needed some back-story. The characters needed more likability. There needed to be a greater depth to the relationships. This movie gave it all of that with the added bonus of giving it a more exciting story line. The novel aside, this movie was absolutely gorgeous in every aspect. The sets, score, and costuming were top quality, and really transported me into 17th century New England. The acting was stunning throughout the cast, with Demi Moore portraying a strong, enduring Hester Prynn, Robert Duvall giving a thoroughly chilling performance as her husband, and Gary Oldman managing to transform Reverend Dimmesdale - a horribly weak and unlikeable character in the book - into a charming and extremely complex man that the audience could sympathize with. There is nothing that this movie didn't have that most Oscar nominated hits have as well. The only flaws I can think of were, and this is a stretch, the excessive amounts of nudity (which on Mr. Oldman's part were actually very welcome), and the fact that the feminist attitudes were slightly anachronistic. But again, does this make The Scarlet Letter bad? I don't think so. The people I saw it with didn't think so. I honestly don't understand how anyone COULD think so. (and I here I though comprehending God was going to be my biggest challenge) So I say go ahead and watch The Scarlet Letter. Just don't turn it on expecting a word-for-word rendition of the book because you will be disappointed. Instead, expect a beautiful, high-quality, high-intensity romantic thrill ride that deserves a much better reception than it received.

    Nope, this film is NOT an accurate adaptation of "The Scarlet Letter" by any stretch of the imagination. It's more like a modern "Variations on a Theme by Nathaniel Hawthorne," or one of those Fantasias that 19th- century composers used to write with a famous, much-older melody as a starting point. That said, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The depiction of late 18th/early 19th century Native American civilization on the Northeastern Seaboard is vividly and richly imagined; don't think I've ever seen this in a film before. Gary Oldman, as a wonderfully sexy and yet perfectly pure young Rev. Dimmesdale, probably would have pleased Hawthorne on the whole, and his chemistry with Demi Moore's obviously anachronistic, but compelling, Hester Prynne is delicious (their scene in the barn is very hot indeed). Finally, something has to be said about the gorgeous John Barry score. What lovely, memorable film music! On the strength of the score alone, I encourage anyone who enjoys romantic stories (and won't be offended by the vast, ridiculous departures from Hawthorne's masterpiece) to give this movie a look.

    I love this movie , Demi Moore's portrayal of Hawthorne's character. From his classic novel was excellent, as the woman who had committed the carnal sin of adultery. And was considered a harlot and a witch. For not only did she have an affair , brought on by feelings of lust and desire. But it was with a Holy man sworn to be loyal and faithful to only the Lord our savior. Which was considered forbidden , so as her punishment she was forced to wear the scarlet letter 'A'. Which stood for adulteress, But she when found out she was with child. And out of wedlock she had only two options , neither one was promising. In the end she had only 4 options be hung, burned , end her affair with the Priest (Oldman) which was forced to leave the church. And her final choice leave with her child and never comeback! Great move fantastic acting ! Due to certain controversial content this movie isn't for everyone! But for anyone who appreciates classic literature this is the movie for you!

    I have noticed that most of the bad reviews for "The Scarlet Letter" are written by lovers of Nathaniel Hawthorn's classic novel of the same name. I myself have read the novel, and I appreciated it as much as the next person, but let's be realistic here; is it really made for the screen? Director Roland Joffe has done the right thing here by adding some extra *umph* to the classic story with the right dose of action and romance - even if many key elements of the novel were altered. First, let's put this into perspective. Yes, Joffe took the title of the book, hinting towards a relatively accurate adaption, which it was not by any means. However, there have been many successful films based on novels that have even used the author's name directly in the title whilst making it just as inaccurate. Example 1: Bram Stoker's Dracula - also starring the wonderful Gary Oldman - TOTALLY strayed from the book but is still a favourite of many. #2: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Complete filth in my opinion (possibly because Frankenstein's my fav book and Ken Branagh is just such a ham in it), but it was still approved by most critics. Get what I'm saying here? Just because a film is not word-for-word like the book it's based on, it doesn't mean that it isn't any good. Truth be told, I love this film! Yes, yes, I'm a bit of a Gary Oldman fan girl, and yes, seeing his wet, naked, beautiful body made me swoon, but that is NOT the only reason why I loved this film. Honest. Despite the incredible length, Scarlet Letter managed to grab my attention from start to finish. The soundtrack, lighting, costuming, sets, camera work, script . . . it was all fantastic. It had me smiling and giggling at the flirty exchanges between Arthur (Gary Oldman) and Hester (Demi Moore), sighing at the love scenes, biting my nails at the moments where those crazy Puritans showed their (arguably) evil side,reaching for tissues at the tragic moments, and had me actually hiding my face behind a pillow when things got really intense. This to me is the mark of a great film. Another great thing is the performances. The entire cast was incredible - a thing that rarely happens. The stars of the film, Moore and Oldman, were both critically knocked for their performances - Gary for not being 'into the role' and Demi for just, well, sucking. NONSENSE!! Gary, while not in his usual bada$$ and over-the-top crazy element, played the charming and romantic version of Dimmesdale to a T. He really let us feel his torment in having to choose between his moral and spiritual beliefs, and his heart (and I can't stress enough how beautiful he is in this role - okay, hormones are settled now). Demi was equally as wonderful, showing us both the strength of a woman seeking independence from domestic and religious restraints, as well as vulnerability in her inability to actually "fight the power" so to speak. Both actors had amazing chemistry and passion - passion for their individual beliefs, for their child, and above all, for each other. Simply wonderful. Another stand-out performance was Joan Plowright as Harriot. She portrayed a gentle, warm and kind wisdom like I have never seen before. I felt immediately drawn to her character. *drum roll* Time for the one and only flaw! My main problem is the unnecessary amounts of gore. I won't say how it's gory, but if you haven't seen this yet, consider yourself warned. I understand that this is a device that only makes the film more powerful and intense, but truthfully, it's just plain hard to watch. OH! I just thought of another flaw. Mituba diddling herself with a candlestick. It might sound like a bad Clue scenario, but lo and behold . . . It's just unnecessary. So those are my two cents. If you're a hard-knock fan of the book, try to forget about it when watching this film. It really is great as an independent story, so just let your mind relax and sink into the creative depths of the directors' interpretation. And keep a pillow handy.

    I am not going to keep on comparing here, but this film as a film and an adaptation is a mess in my opinion. The book is one of the greatest American novels, and is so interesting and thoughtfully written. The film version of The Scarlet Letter does have exquisite costumes, scenery and cinematography, a lush John Barry score and despite the inconsistent accent and a slight need to over-compensate Gary Oldman is surprisingly credible as Dimmersdale. However, the script is trite and the storytelling is uninteresting, has little heart and has some overly-gratuitous scenes such as the bathing scene. The pace is also uneven, some of it is too quick while other scenes are ponderous and stilted. The direction feels lacking, and you know there's something wrong when Oldman gives the only half-decent performance. I love Edward Hardwicke and Joan Plowright but they have awful dialogue and their characters are not written well at all. Robert Duvall is embarrassing here, and that pained me to say that as he is usually brilliant. Worst of all is Demi Moore, I don't hate Moore as much as some do(I liked her very much in Ghost, A Few Good Men and The Hunchback of Notre Dame) but she is very bland and not very believable at all as Hester. Overall, disappointing and a failure film and adaptation-wise. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    This certainly ranks among the Top Ten of "What Were They Thinking?" films ever made. The production is sumptuously photographed, has a more than qualified director in Oscar nominee Roland Joffe, a recognizable supporting cast of Oscar luminaries featuring Gary Oldman, Robert Duvall and Joan Plowright, and a then-bankable leading lady in Demi Moore. Factor in the pedigree associated with Nathaniel Hawthorne's legendary novel and something far more worthwhile should have been the end result. Moore is cast as Hester Prynne, a proper Puritan wife sent ahead to the colonies to prepare a home for she and her husband.

Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such, the film does not conclude, so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.

    I was completely shocked after watching The Scarlet Letter to find such strong negative criticism towards it. 4.7 on IMDb? 14% on rotten tomatoes? nominated for several Razzies?? But why? The only possible answer I can come up with is that this film is largely being critiqued by Hawthorne Puritans, so to speak. And truly, to say that this adaptation strays from the book is like saying that the Kardashians sometimes appear in the media. It does take liberties, and several key plot points have been changed - but does that make it a BAD MOVIE? I have read the Scarlet Letter, and I can see the appeal, but it's not as if it was without it's flaws. It needed some back-story. The characters needed more likability. There needed to be a greater depth to the relationships. This movie gave it all of that with the added bonus of giving it a more exciting story line. The novel aside, this movie was absolutely gorgeous in every aspect. The sets, score, and costuming were top quality, and really transported me into 17th century New England. The acting was stunning throughout the cast, with Demi Moore portraying a strong, enduring Hester Prynn, Robert Duvall giving a thoroughly chilling performance as her husband, and Gary Oldman managing to transform Reverend Dimmesdale - a horribly weak and unlikeable character in the book - into a charming and extremely complex man that the audience could sympathize with. There is nothing that this movie didn't have that most Oscar nominated hits have as well. The only flaws I can think of were, and this is a stretch, the excessive amounts of nudity (which on Mr. Oldman's part were actually very welcome), and the fact that the feminist attitudes were slightly anachronistic. But again, does this make The Scarlet Letter bad? I don't think so. The people I saw it with didn't think so. I honestly don't understand how anyone COULD think so. (and I here I though comprehending God was going to be my biggest challenge) So I say go ahead and watch The Scarlet Letter. Just don't turn it on expecting a word-for-word rendition of the book because you will be disappointed. Instead, expect a beautiful, high-quality, high-intensity romantic thrill ride that deserves a much better reception than it received.

    Nope, this film is NOT an accurate adaptation of "The Scarlet Letter" by any stretch of the imagination. It's more like a modern "Variations on a Theme by Nathaniel Hawthorne," or one of those Fantasias that 19th- century composers used to write with a famous, much-older melody as a starting point. That said, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The depiction of late 18th/early 19th century Native American civilization on the Northeastern Seaboard is vividly and richly imagined; don't think I've ever seen this in a film before. Gary Oldman, as a wonderfully sexy and yet perfectly pure young Rev. Dimmesdale, probably would have pleased Hawthorne on the whole, and his chemistry with Demi Moore's obviously anachronistic, but compelling, Hester Prynne is delicious (their scene in the barn is very hot indeed). Finally, something has to be said about the gorgeous John Barry score. What lovely, memorable film music! On the strength of the score alone, I encourage anyone who enjoys romantic stories (and won't be offended by the vast, ridiculous departures from Hawthorne's masterpiece) to give this movie a look.

    I love this movie , Demi Moore's portrayal of Hawthorne's character. From his classic novel was excellent, as the woman who had committed the carnal sin of adultery. And was considered a harlot and a witch. For not only did she have an affair , brought on by feelings of lust and desire. But it was with a Holy man sworn to be loyal and faithful to only the Lord our savior. Which was considered forbidden , so as her punishment she was forced to wear the scarlet letter 'A'. Which stood for adulteress, But she when found out she was with child. And out of wedlock she had only two options , neither one was promising. In the end she had only 4 options be hung, burned , end her affair with the Priest (Oldman) which was forced to leave the church. And her final choice leave with her child and never comeback! Great move fantastic acting ! Due to certain controversial content this movie isn't for everyone! But for anyone who appreciates classic literature this is the movie for you!

    I have noticed that most of the bad reviews for "The Scarlet Letter" are written by lovers of Nathaniel Hawthorn's classic novel of the same name. I myself have read the novel, and I appreciated it as much as the next person, but let's be realistic here; is it really made for the screen? Director Roland Joffe has done the right thing here by adding some extra *umph* to the classic story with the right dose of action and romance - even if many key elements of the novel were altered. First, let's put this into perspective. Yes, Joffe took the title of the book, hinting towards a relatively accurate adaption, which it was not by any means. However, there have been many successful films based on novels that have even used the author's name directly in the title whilst making it just as inaccurate. Example 1: Bram Stoker's Dracula - also starring the wonderful Gary Oldman - TOTALLY strayed from the book but is still a favourite of many. #2: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Complete filth in my opinion (possibly because Frankenstein's my fav book and Ken Branagh is just such a ham in it), but it was still approved by most critics. Get what I'm saying here? Just because a film is not word-for-word like the book it's based on, it doesn't mean that it isn't any good. Truth be told, I love this film! Yes, yes, I'm a bit of a Gary Oldman fan girl, and yes, seeing his wet, naked, beautiful body made me swoon, but that is NOT the only reason why I loved this film. Honest. Despite the incredible length, Scarlet Letter managed to grab my attention from start to finish. The soundtrack, lighting, costuming, sets, camera work, script . . . it was all fantastic. It had me smiling and giggling at the flirty exchanges between Arthur (Gary Oldman) and Hester (Demi Moore), sighing at the love scenes, biting my nails at the moments where those crazy Puritans showed their (arguably) evil side,reaching for tissues at the tragic moments, and had me actually hiding my face behind a pillow when things got really intense. This to me is the mark of a great film. Another great thing is the performances. The entire cast was incredible - a thing that rarely happens. The stars of the film, Moore and Oldman, were both critically knocked for their performances - Gary for not being 'into the role' and Demi for just, well, sucking. NONSENSE!! Gary, while not in his usual bada$$ and over-the-top crazy element, played the charming and romantic version of Dimmesdale to a T. He really let us feel his torment in having to choose between his moral and spiritual beliefs, and his heart (and I can't stress enough how beautiful he is in this role - okay, hormones are settled now). Demi was equally as wonderful, showing us both the strength of a woman seeking independence from domestic and religious restraints, as well as vulnerability in her inability to actually "fight the power" so to speak. Both actors had amazing chemistry and passion - passion for their individual beliefs, for their child, and above all, for each other. Simply wonderful. Another stand-out performance was Joan Plowright as Harriot. She portrayed a gentle, warm and kind wisdom like I have never seen before. I felt immediately drawn to her character. *drum roll* Time for the one and only flaw! My main problem is the unnecessary amounts of gore. I won't say how it's gory, but if you haven't seen this yet, consider yourself warned. I understand that this is a device that only makes the film more powerful and intense, but truthfully, it's just plain hard to watch. OH! I just thought of another flaw. Mituba diddling herself with a candlestick. It might sound like a bad Clue scenario, but lo and behold . . . It's just unnecessary. So those are my two cents. If you're a hard-knock fan of the book, try to forget about it when watching this film. It really is great as an independent story, so just let your mind relax and sink into the creative depths of the directors' interpretation. And keep a pillow handy.

    I am not going to keep on comparing here, but this film as a film and an adaptation is a mess in my opinion. The book is one of the greatest American novels, and is so interesting and thoughtfully written. The film version of The Scarlet Letter does have exquisite costumes, scenery and cinematography, a lush John Barry score and despite the inconsistent accent and a slight need to over-compensate Gary Oldman is surprisingly credible as Dimmersdale. However, the script is trite and the storytelling is uninteresting, has little heart and has some overly-gratuitous scenes such as the bathing scene. The pace is also uneven, some of it is too quick while other scenes are ponderous and stilted. The direction feels lacking, and you know there's something wrong when Oldman gives the only half-decent performance. I love Edward Hardwicke and Joan Plowright but they have awful dialogue and their characters are not written well at all. Robert Duvall is embarrassing here, and that pained me to say that as he is usually brilliant. Worst of all is Demi Moore, I don't hate Moore as much as some do(I liked her very much in Ghost, A Few Good Men and The Hunchback of Notre Dame) but she is very bland and not very believable at all as Hester. Overall, disappointing and a failure film and adaptation-wise. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    This is one of the worst major-studio literary adaptations ever, and I've given it a 1 rating because it deserves to be in the IMDb bottom 100--though in terms of (unintentionally hilarious) entertainment value I'd give it a 6. Maybe even an 8. I'm no huge fan of Hawthorne--his novels are pretty dry, dull and moralistic, like much pre-20th-century American lit--but his whole story is outrageously skewed here to suit Demi Moore's ego. She was at the top of her stardom then. This, "G.I. Jane" and "Striptease" pretty much destroyed that status--and all because each of them was wrecked by the need to flatter her so much. She needs to be the toughest yet most sensitive, sexiest yet most spiritual, etc. etc. person on screen--which would be OK if she were playing an action heroine or female superhero, but was disastrous for these particular stories. "G.I. Jane" could have been a gritty look at women's military life, "Striptease" has considerable sequences--all without Demi--where it's a very funny retro screwball comedy. But her humorless image-sculpting ruined both. Then there's "Scarlet Letter." Whoa. Roland Joffe is not a good director (despite having gotten praise for the fairly good "Killing Fields" and overrated "The Mission"--since then it's been all downhill). But the problem here is clearly that Demi wants to reshape Hester Prynne from Puritan victim of Puritanism into a hot ass-kicking, erotically supercharged mama who connects as a kindred soul with local Native Americans and hosts a sort of women's consciousness-raising/sewing group. In colonial New England. Uh-huh. I kinda love this movie--it's so slick yet incredibly wrongheaded, encouraging possibly the worst performances ever by some very good actors (Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall for starters), that it's frequently hilarious. It's one of those rare crazy monuments to a star's ego--at the expense of any fidelity or credibility--that results in an instant camp classic.

    I have never read Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th century novel, but apparently this is total rape and murder of it. Admittedly Demi Moore's Hester is extremely irritating, like all of the movie's strrrooong women, and celebration of adultery would make poor, Victorian Nathaniel turn scarlet too, but production values are lush and the film is not without entertainment value. Think, for example, the hysterical scene where Hester (or whoever this modern woman among Puritans is) puts wreath of flowers to her head and runs in the woods like 17th century hippie! She is free spirit in narrow-minded, bigoted society, get it? As filmed version of Historical Harlequin book this is not bad at all, as Hawthorne adaptation it is, of course, insulting travesty and understandably angered book's fans.

    I can ensure you that The Scarlet Letter receives too much negative criticism. It's an easy target. I've never read the novel though I wish I did read it so I could better effectively rate the movie, but the book is great so the movie has big shoes to fill. The Scarlet Letter is clearly a fine film. Its direct comparisons to the book is one big reason for all the underratings, another big reason is The Scarlet Letter viewing sells itself as some great movie, with its vivid storytelling, its great acting and strong cinematography, yet it's not quite great. It's hard and difficult to deliver a pure dramatic period piece based on a strong selling novel. The movie may supposed to be sophisticated, elegant drama, but The Scarlet Letter quickly settles into a regular on the surface movie at the time when Authur and Hester meet, not being too artistically poetic, but more commonly driven by its desires. The Scarlet Letter is lost between those two film modes with no seaming connection. Another strong critique is it's missing very intriguing plot points. All this lessens the film, but not all so much. The Scarlet Letter is a passionate romance taking place in a beautiful though turbulent setting. It has a good, deep cast. Demi Moore and Gary Oldman as Hester Prynne and Authur Dimmsdale make The Scarlet Letter good all while their characters engage in forbidden lust. Moore and Oldman offer tour de forces in The Scarlet Letter. Moore is beauty at its finest. I love Demi Moore and Gary Oldman, two my favorite and two of the very best. I quite enjoy their impassioned performances in The Scarlet Letter. It may make the characters themselves slightly exaggerated, but Oldman and Moore do a good job of maintaining it. I wouldn't change it if I could. The Scarlet Letter is a great tragic love story in the form of a good movie. I must say, The Scarlet Letter is really good, and anyone who bashes it as bad is being too harsh. It's a strong 6. The Scarlet Letter is a great stay at home couples date night movie because it's boldly, desperately romantic and you do not have to watch it too closely to follow it as it speaks of pure passion being very passionately compelling.

    I generally dislike movie critics because I have really liked many movies they pan and I've not liked some movies they extolled. I think all of performances in The Scarlet Letter were spot on. Demi's portrayal of a woman taking a stand against rigid moral codes and repression of women was very well done. She avoided being too strident trying to walk the hard line between the mores of the 1700's and following the demands of her heart and body in her love for Rev. Dimmesdale. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors and I've never seen him give a bad performance. The tight control he's trying to keep when he's so in love and lusting after Hester is a wonder to watch. The Reverend's place in his church, his community and his faith is turned upside down putting his life in jeopardy preventing him from doing what he knows is right in speaking up to defend his love and claim his child. The scene in the barn when Hester and Arthur finally consummate their love is one of the most sensual and beautifully filmed love scenes I've ever seen. Since I love happier endings, I'm glad they took poetic license and did not strictly adhere to the book.

    This certainly ranks among the Top Ten of "What Were They Thinking?" films ever made. The production is sumptuously photographed, has a more than qualified director in Oscar nominee Roland Joffe, a recognizable supporting cast of Oscar luminaries featuring Gary Oldman, Robert Duvall and Joan Plowright, and a then-bankable leading lady in Demi Moore. Factor in the pedigree associated with Nathaniel Hawthorne's legendary novel and something far more worthwhile should have been the end result. Moore is cast as Hester Prynne, a proper Puritan wife sent ahead to the colonies to prepare a home for she and her husband. Emboldened by the new responsibilities thrust upon her and some of the new relationships she starts, Hester gives in to an attraction to the righteous Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Oldman) when it is believed that her husband has perished in an Indian massacre. Hester's peccadillo and her subsequent illegitimate pregnancy cause her to become persona non grata in the colony and she is forced to wear the scarlet letter of the title brandishing her an adulterer. Anyone who made it through high school is familiar with the tale of Hester Prynne, but given the issues inherent in the material and how it still remains pertinent in today's society with women's right being trampled on, its cinematic adaptations have been amazingly rare. So it is doubly unfortunate that Joffe and company have so succinctly bungled this effort. Moore is pretty as a picture, but entirely too contemporary a presence to convince as Hester. She provides neither the insight nor the range to make Hester's plight palpable. Oldman is solid and provides a titillating full frontal voyeuristic skinny-dip, but his role is beyond ridiculous (more on that later). Robert Duvall as Hester's wacko husband shows up later in the film and gives the worst performance of his career. This is so bad it is akin to the work Nick Nolte contributed in Hulk. And pretty much everyone is out-acted by a bird that seems to be chirping for sexual freedom. The film's biggest problem and the result of its failure is that it fails to have respect or even understand the entire point of the source. No one feels that Joffe needs to be slavishly faithful to Hawthorne's prose. And sexing the material up for modern audiences is also not an unwise call. However, what is absurd is basically castrating the story of its core. Joffe and company take the window dressing of the Scarlett Letter, but abandon its entire reason for being. Hawthorne's story was an indictment of Puritanism and the hypocrisy of Christianity in that Reverend Dimmesdale was a self-righteous blowhard stirring up his foolish flock and leading the charge against Hester by day, while being her lover at night and demanding she keep their secret. If anything, he is the villain of the piece, yet the film version somehow re-imagines him as a worthwhile, misunderstood romantic figure! Instead of Dimmesdale being depicted justly as a craven, cowardly monument of hypocrisy, we instead get Dimmesdale as the Puritan answer to Fabio and Duvall gets to usurp the villain role as Hester's wild-eyed madman hubby. This shift in narrative, plus changes in the latter half of the film including the ending, completely abandons the entire purpose of Hawthorne's tale. Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such, the film does not conclude, so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.

The book is one of the greatest American novels, and is so interesting and thoughtfully written. The film version of The Scarlet Letter does have exquisite costumes, scenery and cinematography, a lush John Barry score and despite the inconsistent accent and a slight need to over-compensate Gary Oldman is surprisingly credible as Dimmersdale. However, the script is trite and the storytelling is uninteresting, has little heart and has some overly-gratuitous scenes such as the bathing scene. The pace is also uneven, some of it is too quick while other scenes are ponderous and stilted. The direction feels lacking, and you know there's something wrong when Oldman gives the only half-decent performance. I love Edward Hardwicke and Joan Plowright but they have awful dialogue and their characters are not written well at all. Robert Duvall is embarrassing here, and that pained me to say that as he is usually brilliant. Worst of all is Demi Moore, I don't hate Moore as much as some do(I liked her very much in Ghost, A Few Good Men and The Hunchback of Notre Dame) but she is very bland and not very believable at all as Hester. Overall, disappointing and a failure film and adaptation-wise. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    This is one of the worst major-studio literary adaptations ever, and I've given it a 1 rating because it deserves to be in the IMDb bottom 100--though in terms of (unintentionally hilarious) entertainment value I'd give it a 6. Maybe even an 8. I'm no huge fan of Hawthorne--his novels are pretty dry, dull and moralistic, like much pre-20th-century American lit--but his whole story is outrageously skewed here to suit Demi Moore's ego. She was at the top of her stardom then. This, "G.I. Jane" and "Striptease" pretty much destroyed that status--and all because each of them was wrecked by the need to flatter her so much. She needs to be the toughest yet most sensitive, sexiest yet most spiritual, etc. etc. person on screen--which would be OK if she were playing an action heroine or female superhero, but was disastrous for these particular stories. "G.I. Jane" could have been a gritty look at women's military life, "Striptease" has considerable sequences--all without Demi--where it's a very funny retro screwball comedy. But her humorless image-sculpting ruined both. Then there's "Scarlet Letter." Whoa. Roland Joffe is not a good director (despite having gotten praise for the fairly good "Killing Fields" and overrated "The Mission"--since then it's been all downhill). But the problem here is clearly that Demi wants to reshape Hester Prynne from Puritan victim of Puritanism into a hot ass-kicking, erotically supercharged mama who connects as a kindred soul with local Native Americans and hosts a sort of women's consciousness-raising/sewing group. In colonial New England. Uh-huh. I kinda love this movie--it's so slick yet incredibly wrongheaded, encouraging possibly the worst performances ever by some very good actors (Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall for starters), that it's frequently hilarious. It's one of those rare crazy monuments to a star's ego--at the expense of any fidelity or credibility--that results in an instant camp classic.

    I have never read Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th century novel, but apparently this is total rape and murder of it. Admittedly Demi Moore's Hester is extremely irritating, like all of the movie's strrrooong women, and celebration of adultery would make poor, Victorian Nathaniel turn scarlet too, but production values are lush and the film is not without entertainment value. Think, for example, the hysterical scene where Hester (or whoever this modern woman among Puritans is) puts wreath of flowers to her head and runs in the woods like 17th century hippie! She is free spirit in narrow-minded, bigoted society, get it? As filmed version of Historical Harlequin book this is not bad at all, as Hawthorne adaptation it is, of course, insulting travesty and understandably angered book's fans.

    I can ensure you that The Scarlet Letter receives too much negative criticism. It's an easy target. I've never read the novel though I wish I did read it so I could better effectively rate the movie, but the book is great so the movie has big shoes to fill. The Scarlet Letter is clearly a fine film. Its direct comparisons to the book is one big reason for all the underratings, another big reason is The Scarlet Letter viewing sells itself as some great movie, with its vivid storytelling, its great acting and strong cinematography, yet it's not quite great. It's hard and difficult to deliver a pure dramatic period piece based on a strong selling novel. The movie may supposed to be sophisticated, elegant drama, but The Scarlet Letter quickly settles into a regular on the surface movie at the time when Authur and Hester meet, not being too artistically poetic, but more commonly driven by its desires. The Scarlet Letter is lost between those two film modes with no seaming connection. Another strong critique is it's missing very intriguing plot points. All this lessens the film, but not all so much. The Scarlet Letter is a passionate romance taking place in a beautiful though turbulent setting. It has a good, deep cast. Demi Moore and Gary Oldman as Hester Prynne and Authur Dimmsdale make The Scarlet Letter good all while their characters engage in forbidden lust. Moore and Oldman offer tour de forces in The Scarlet Letter. Moore is beauty at its finest. I love Demi Moore and Gary Oldman, two my favorite and two of the very best. I quite enjoy their impassioned performances in The Scarlet Letter. It may make the characters themselves slightly exaggerated, but Oldman and Moore do a good job of maintaining it. I wouldn't change it if I could. The Scarlet Letter is a great tragic love story in the form of a good movie. I must say, The Scarlet Letter is really good, and anyone who bashes it as bad is being too harsh. It's a strong 6. The Scarlet Letter is a great stay at home couples date night movie because it's boldly, desperately romantic and you do not have to watch it too closely to follow it as it speaks of pure passion being very passionately compelling.

    I generally dislike movie critics because I have really liked many movies they pan and I've not liked some movies they extolled. I think all of performances in The Scarlet Letter were spot on. Demi's portrayal of a woman taking a stand against rigid moral codes and repression of women was very well done. She avoided being too strident trying to walk the hard line between the mores of the 1700's and following the demands of her heart and body in her love for Rev. Dimmesdale. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors and I've never seen him give a bad performance. The tight control he's trying to keep when he's so in love and lusting after Hester is a wonder to watch. The Reverend's place in his church, his community and his faith is turned upside down putting his life in jeopardy preventing him from doing what he knows is right in speaking up to defend his love and claim his child. The scene in the barn when Hester and Arthur finally consummate their love is one of the most sensual and beautifully filmed love scenes I've ever seen. Since I love happier endings, I'm glad they took poetic license and did not strictly adhere to the book.

    This certainly ranks among the Top Ten of "What Were They Thinking?" films ever made. The production is sumptuously photographed, has a more than qualified director in Oscar nominee Roland Joffe, a recognizable supporting cast of Oscar luminaries featuring Gary Oldman, Robert Duvall and Joan Plowright, and a then-bankable leading lady in Demi Moore. Factor in the pedigree associated with Nathaniel Hawthorne's legendary novel and something far more worthwhile should have been the end result. Moore is cast as Hester Prynne, a proper Puritan wife sent ahead to the colonies to prepare a home for she and her husband. Emboldened by the new responsibilities thrust upon her and some of the new relationships she starts, Hester gives in to an attraction to the righteous Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Oldman) when it is believed that her husband has perished in an Indian massacre. Hester's peccadillo and her subsequent illegitimate pregnancy cause her to become persona non grata in the colony and she is forced to wear the scarlet letter of the title brandishing her an adulterer. Anyone who made it through high school is familiar with the tale of Hester Prynne, but given the issues inherent in the material and how it still remains pertinent in today's society with women's right being trampled on, its cinematic adaptations have been amazingly rare. So it is doubly unfortunate that Joffe and company have so succinctly bungled this effort. Moore is pretty as a picture, but entirely too contemporary a presence to convince as Hester. She provides neither the insight nor the range to make Hester's plight palpable. Oldman is solid and provides a titillating full frontal voyeuristic skinny-dip, but his role is beyond ridiculous (more on that later). Robert Duvall as Hester's wacko husband shows up later in the film and gives the worst performance of his career. This is so bad it is akin to the work Nick Nolte contributed in Hulk. And pretty much everyone is out-acted by a bird that seems to be chirping for sexual freedom. The film's biggest problem and the result of its failure is that it fails to have respect or even understand the entire point of the source. No one feels that Joffe needs to be slavishly faithful to Hawthorne's prose. And sexing the material up for modern audiences is also not an unwise call. However, what is absurd is basically castrating the story of its core. Joffe and company take the window dressing of the Scarlett Letter, but abandon its entire reason for being. Hawthorne's story was an indictment of Puritanism and the hypocrisy of Christianity in that Reverend Dimmesdale was a self-righteous blowhard stirring up his foolish flock and leading the charge against Hester by day, while being her lover at night and demanding she keep their secret. If anything, he is the villain of the piece, yet the film version somehow re-imagines him as a worthwhile, misunderstood romantic figure! Instead of Dimmesdale being depicted justly as a craven, cowardly monument of hypocrisy, we instead get Dimmesdale as the Puritan answer to Fabio and Duvall gets to usurp the villain role as Hester's wild-eyed madman hubby. This shift in narrative, plus changes in the latter half of the film including the ending, completely abandons the entire purpose of Hawthorne's tale. Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such, the film does not conclude, so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.

    I was completely shocked after watching The Scarlet Letter to find such strong negative criticism towards it. 4.7 on IMDb? 14% on rotten tomatoes? nominated for several Razzies?? But why? The only possible answer I can come up with is that this film is largely being critiqued by Hawthorne Puritans, so to speak. And truly, to say that this adaptation strays from the book is like saying that the Kardashians sometimes appear in the media. It does take liberties, and several key plot points have been changed - but does that make it a BAD MOVIE? I have read the Scarlet Letter, and I can see the appeal, but it's not as if it was without it's flaws. It needed some back-story. The characters needed more likability. There needed to be a greater depth to the relationships. This movie gave it all of that with the added bonus of giving it a more exciting story line. The novel aside, this movie was absolutely gorgeous in every aspect. The sets, score, and costuming were top quality, and really transported me into 17th century New England. The acting was stunning throughout the cast, with Demi Moore portraying a strong, enduring Hester Prynn, Robert Duvall giving a thoroughly chilling performance as her husband, and Gary Oldman managing to transform Reverend Dimmesdale - a horribly weak and unlikeable character in the book - into a charming and extremely complex man that the audience could sympathize with. There is nothing that this movie didn't have that most Oscar nominated hits have as well. The only flaws I can think of were, and this is a stretch, the excessive amounts of nudity (which on Mr. Oldman's part were actually very welcome), and the fact that the feminist attitudes were slightly anachronistic. But again, does this make The Scarlet Letter bad? I don't think so. The people I saw it with didn't think so. I honestly don't understand how anyone COULD think so. (and I here I though comprehending God was going to be my biggest challenge) So I say go ahead and watch The Scarlet Letter. Just don't turn it on expecting a word-for-word rendition of the book because you will be disappointed. Instead, expect a beautiful, high-quality, high-intensity romantic thrill ride that deserves a much better reception than it received.

    Nope, this film is NOT an accurate adaptation of "The Scarlet Letter" by any stretch of the imagination. It's more like a modern "Variations on a Theme by Nathaniel Hawthorne," or one of those Fantasias that 19th- century composers used to write with a famous, much-older melody as a starting point. That said, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The depiction of late 18th/early 19th century Native American civilization on the Northeastern Seaboard is vividly and richly imagined; don't think I've ever seen this in a film before. Gary Oldman, as a wonderfully sexy and yet perfectly pure young Rev. Dimmesdale, probably would have pleased Hawthorne on the whole, and his chemistry with Demi Moore's obviously anachronistic, but compelling, Hester Prynne is delicious (their scene in the barn is very hot indeed). Finally, something has to be said about the gorgeous John Barry score. What lovely, memorable film music! On the strength of the score alone, I encourage anyone who enjoys romantic stories (and won't be offended by the vast, ridiculous departures from Hawthorne's masterpiece) to give this movie a look.

    I love this movie , Demi Moore's portrayal of Hawthorne's character. From his classic novel was excellent, as the woman who had committed the carnal sin of adultery. And was considered a harlot and a witch. For not only did she have an affair , brought on by feelings of lust and desire. But it was with a Holy man sworn to be loyal and faithful to only the Lord our savior. Which was considered forbidden , so as her punishment she was forced to wear the scarlet letter 'A'. Which stood for adulteress, But she when found out she was with child. And out of wedlock she had only two options , neither one was promising. In the end she had only 4 options be hung, burned , end her affair with the Priest (Oldman) which was forced to leave the church. And her final choice leave with her child and never comeback! Great move fantastic acting ! Due to certain controversial content this movie isn't for everyone! But for anyone who appreciates classic literature this is the movie for you!

    I have noticed that most of the bad reviews for "The Scarlet Letter" are written by lovers of Nathaniel Hawthorn's classic novel of the same name. I myself have read the novel, and I appreciated it as much as the next person, but let's be realistic here; is it really made for the screen? Director Roland Joffe has done the right thing here by adding some extra *umph* to the classic story with the right dose of action and romance - even if many key elements of the novel were altered. First, let's put this into perspective. Yes, Joffe took the title of the book, hinting towards a relatively accurate adaption, which it was not by any means. However, there have been many successful films based on novels that have even used the author's name directly in the title whilst making it just as inaccurate. Example 1: Bram Stoker's Dracula - also starring the wonderful Gary Oldman - TOTALLY strayed from the book but is still a favourite of many. #2: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Complete filth in my opinion (possibly because Frankenstein's my fav book and Ken Branagh is just such a ham in it), but it was still approved by most critics. Get what I'm saying here? Just because a film is not word-for-word like the book it's based on, it doesn't mean that it isn't any good. Truth be told, I love this film! Yes, yes, I'm a bit of a Gary Oldman fan girl, and yes, seeing his wet, naked, beautiful body made me swoon, but that is NOT the only reason why I loved this film. Honest. Despite the incredible length, Scarlet Letter managed to grab my attention from start to finish. The soundtrack, lighting, costuming, sets, camera work, script . . . it was all fantastic. It had me smiling and giggling at the flirty exchanges between Arthur (Gary Oldman) and Hester (Demi Moore), sighing at the love scenes, biting my nails at the moments where those crazy Puritans showed their (arguably) evil side,reaching for tissues at the tragic moments, and had me actually hiding my face behind a pillow when things got really intense. This to me is the mark of a great film. Another great thing is the performances. The entire cast was incredible - a thing that rarely happens. The stars of the film, Moore and Oldman, were both critically knocked for their performances - Gary for not being 'into the role' and Demi for just, well, sucking. NONSENSE!! Gary, while not in his usual bada$$ and over-the-top crazy element, played the charming and romantic version of Dimmesdale to a T. He really let us feel his torment in having to choose between his moral and spiritual beliefs, and his heart (and I can't stress enough how beautiful he is in this role - okay, hormones are settled now). Demi was equally as wonderful, showing us both the strength of a woman seeking independence from domestic and religious restraints, as well as vulnerability in her inability to actually "fight the power" so to speak. Both actors had amazing chemistry and passion - passion for their individual beliefs, for their child, and above all, for each other. Simply wonderful. Another stand-out performance was Joan Plowright as Harriot. She portrayed a gentle, warm and kind wisdom like I have never seen before. I felt immediately drawn to her character. *drum roll* Time for the one and only flaw! My main problem is the unnecessary amounts of gore. I won't say how it's gory, but if you haven't seen this yet, consider yourself warned. I understand that this is a device that only makes the film more powerful and intense, but truthfully, it's just plain hard to watch. OH! I just thought of another flaw. Mituba diddling herself with a candlestick. It might sound like a bad Clue scenario, but lo and behold . . . It's just unnecessary. So those are my two cents. If you're a hard-knock fan of the book, try to forget about it when watching this film. It really is great as an independent story, so just let your mind relax and sink into the creative depths of the directors' interpretation. And keep a pillow handy.

Robert Duvall as Hester's wacko husband shows up later in the film and gives the worst performance of his career. This is so bad it is akin to the work Nick Nolte contributed in Hulk. And pretty much everyone is out-acted by a bird that seems to be chirping for sexual freedom. The film's biggest problem and the result of its failure is that it fails to have respect or even understand the entire point of the source. No one feels that Joffe needs to be slavishly faithful to Hawthorne's prose. And sexing the material up for modern audiences is also not an unwise call. However, what is absurd is basically castrating the story of its core. Joffe and company take the window dressing of the Scarlett Letter, but abandon its entire reason for being. Hawthorne's story was an indictment of Puritanism and the hypocrisy of Christianity in that Reverend Dimmesdale was a self-righteous blowhard stirring up his foolish flock and leading the charge against Hester by day, while being her lover at night and demanding she keep their secret. If anything, he is the villain of the piece, yet the film version somehow re-imagines him as a worthwhile, misunderstood romantic figure! Instead of Dimmesdale being depicted justly as a craven, cowardly monument of hypocrisy, we instead get Dimmesdale as the Puritan answer to Fabio and Duvall gets to usurp the villain role as Hester's wild-eyed madman hubby. This shift in narrative, plus changes in the latter half of the film including the ending, completely abandons the entire purpose of Hawthorne's tale. Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such, the film does not conclude, so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.

    I was completely shocked after watching The Scarlet Letter to find such strong negative criticism towards it. 4.7 on IMDb? 14% on rotten tomatoes? nominated for several Razzies?? But why? The only possible answer I can come up with is that this film is largely being critiqued by Hawthorne Puritans, so to speak. And truly, to say that this adaptation strays from the book is like saying that the Kardashians sometimes appear in the media. It does take liberties, and several key plot points have been changed - but does that make it a BAD MOVIE? I have read the Scarlet Letter, and I can see the appeal, but it's not as if it was without it's flaws. It needed some back-story. The characters needed more likability. There needed to be a greater depth to the relationships. This movie gave it all of that with the added bonus of giving it a more exciting story line. The novel aside, this movie was absolutely gorgeous in every aspect. The sets, score, and costuming were top quality, and really transported me into 17th century New England. The acting was stunning throughout the cast, with Demi Moore portraying a strong, enduring Hester Prynn, Robert Duvall giving a thoroughly chilling performance as her husband, and Gary Oldman managing to transform Reverend Dimmesdale - a horribly weak and unlikeable character in the book - into a charming and extremely complex man that the audience could sympathize with. There is nothing that this movie didn't have that most Oscar nominated hits have as well. The only flaws I can think of were, and this is a stretch, the excessive amounts of nudity (which on Mr. Oldman's part were actually very welcome), and the fact that the feminist attitudes were slightly anachronistic. But again, does this make The Scarlet Letter bad? I don't think so. The people I saw it with didn't think so. I honestly don't understand how anyone COULD think so. (and I here I though comprehending God was going to be my biggest challenge) So I say go ahead and watch The Scarlet Letter. Just don't turn it on expecting a word-for-word rendition of the book because you will be disappointed. Instead, expect a beautiful, high-quality, high-intensity romantic thrill ride that deserves a much better reception than it received.

    Nope, this film is NOT an accurate adaptation of "The Scarlet Letter" by any stretch of the imagination. It's more like a modern "Variations on a Theme by Nathaniel Hawthorne," or one of those Fantasias that 19th- century composers used to write with a famous, much-older melody as a starting point. That said, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The depiction of late 18th/early 19th century Native American civilization on the Northeastern Seaboard is vividly and richly imagined; don't think I've ever seen this in a film before. Gary Oldman, as a wonderfully sexy and yet perfectly pure young Rev. Dimmesdale, probably would have pleased Hawthorne on the whole, and his chemistry with Demi Moore's obviously anachronistic, but compelling, Hester Prynne is delicious (their scene in the barn is very hot indeed). Finally, something has to be said about the gorgeous John Barry score. What lovely, memorable film music! On the strength of the score alone, I encourage anyone who enjoys romantic stories (and won't be offended by the vast, ridiculous departures from Hawthorne's masterpiece) to give this movie a look.

    I love this movie , Demi Moore's portrayal of Hawthorne's character. From his classic novel was excellent, as the woman who had committed the carnal sin of adultery. And was considered a harlot and a witch. For not only did she have an affair , brought on by feelings of lust and desire. But it was with a Holy man sworn to be loyal and faithful to only the Lord our savior. Which was considered forbidden , so as her punishment she was forced to wear the scarlet letter 'A'. Which stood for adulteress, But she when found out she was with child. And out of wedlock she had only two options , neither one was promising. In the end she had only 4 options be hung, burned , end her affair with the Priest (Oldman) which was forced to leave the church. And her final choice leave with her child and never comeback! Great move fantastic acting ! Due to certain controversial content this movie isn't for everyone! But for anyone who appreciates classic literature this is the movie for you!

    I have noticed that most of the bad reviews for "The Scarlet Letter" are written by lovers of Nathaniel Hawthorn's classic novel of the same name. I myself have read the novel, and I appreciated it as much as the next person, but let's be realistic here; is it really made for the screen? Director Roland Joffe has done the right thing here by adding some extra *umph* to the classic story with the right dose of action and romance - even if many key elements of the novel were altered. First, let's put this into perspective. Yes, Joffe took the title of the book, hinting towards a relatively accurate adaption, which it was not by any means. However, there have been many successful films based on novels that have even used the author's name directly in the title whilst making it just as inaccurate. Example 1: Bram Stoker's Dracula - also starring the wonderful Gary Oldman - TOTALLY strayed from the book but is still a favourite of many. #2: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Complete filth in my opinion (possibly because Frankenstein's my fav book and Ken Branagh is just such a ham in it), but it was still approved by most critics. Get what I'm saying here? Just because a film is not word-for-word like the book it's based on, it doesn't mean that it isn't any good. Truth be told, I love this film! Yes, yes, I'm a bit of a Gary Oldman fan girl, and yes, seeing his wet, naked, beautiful body made me swoon, but that is NOT the only reason why I loved this film. Honest. Despite the incredible length, Scarlet Letter managed to grab my attention from start to finish. The soundtrack, lighting, costuming, sets, camera work, script . . . it was all fantastic. It had me smiling and giggling at the flirty exchanges between Arthur (Gary Oldman) and Hester (Demi Moore), sighing at the love scenes, biting my nails at the moments where those crazy Puritans showed their (arguably) evil side,reaching for tissues at the tragic moments, and had me actually hiding my face behind a pillow when things got really intense. This to me is the mark of a great film. Another great thing is the performances. The entire cast was incredible - a thing that rarely happens. The stars of the film, Moore and Oldman, were both critically knocked for their performances - Gary for not being 'into the role' and Demi for just, well, sucking. NONSENSE!! Gary, while not in his usual bada$$ and over-the-top crazy element, played the charming and romantic version of Dimmesdale to a T. He really let us feel his torment in having to choose between his moral and spiritual beliefs, and his heart (and I can't stress enough how beautiful he is in this role - okay, hormones are settled now). Demi was equally as wonderful, showing us both the strength of a woman seeking independence from domestic and religious restraints, as well as vulnerability in her inability to actually "fight the power" so to speak. Both actors had amazing chemistry and passion - passion for their individual beliefs, for their child, and above all, for each other. Simply wonderful. Another stand-out performance was Joan Plowright as Harriot. She portrayed a gentle, warm and kind wisdom like I have never seen before. I felt immediately drawn to her character. *drum roll* Time for the one and only flaw! My main problem is the unnecessary amounts of gore. I won't say how it's gory, but if you haven't seen this yet, consider yourself warned. I understand that this is a device that only makes the film more powerful and intense, but truthfully, it's just plain hard to watch. OH! I just thought of another flaw. Mituba diddling herself with a candlestick. It might sound like a bad Clue scenario, but lo and behold . . . It's just unnecessary. So those are my two cents. If you're a hard-knock fan of the book, try to forget about it when watching this film. It really is great as an independent story, so just let your mind relax and sink into the creative depths of the directors' interpretation. And keep a pillow handy.

    I am not going to keep on comparing here, but this film as a film and an adaptation is a mess in my opinion. The book is one of the greatest American novels, and is so interesting and thoughtfully written. The film version of The Scarlet Letter does have exquisite costumes, scenery and cinematography, a lush John Barry score and despite the inconsistent accent and a slight need to over-compensate Gary Oldman is surprisingly credible as Dimmersdale. However, the script is trite and the storytelling is uninteresting, has little heart and has some overly-gratuitous scenes such as the bathing scene. The pace is also uneven, some of it is too quick while other scenes are ponderous and stilted. The direction feels lacking, and you know there's something wrong when Oldman gives the only half-decent performance. I love Edward Hardwicke and Joan Plowright but they have awful dialogue and their characters are not written well at all. Robert Duvall is embarrassing here, and that pained me to say that as he is usually brilliant. Worst of all is Demi Moore, I don't hate Moore as much as some do(I liked her very much in Ghost, A Few Good Men and The Hunchback of Notre Dame) but she is very bland and not very believable at all as Hester. Overall, disappointing and a failure film and adaptation-wise. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    This is one of the worst major-studio literary adaptations ever, and I've given it a 1 rating because it deserves to be in the IMDb bottom 100--though in terms of (unintentionally hilarious) entertainment value I'd give it a 6. Maybe even an 8. I'm no huge fan of Hawthorne--his novels are pretty dry, dull and moralistic, like much pre-20th-century American lit--but his whole story is outrageously skewed here to suit Demi Moore's ego. She was at the top of her stardom then. This, "G.I. Jane" and "Striptease" pretty much destroyed that status--and all because each of them was wrecked by the need to flatter her so much. She needs to be the toughest yet most sensitive, sexiest yet most spiritual, etc. etc. person on screen--which would be OK if she were playing an action heroine or female superhero, but was disastrous for these particular stories. "G.I. Jane" could have been a gritty look at women's military life, "Striptease" has considerable sequences--all without Demi--where it's a very funny retro screwball comedy. But her humorless image-sculpting ruined both. Then there's "Scarlet Letter." Whoa. Roland Joffe is not a good director (despite having gotten praise for the fairly good "Killing Fields" and overrated "The Mission"--since then it's been all downhill). But the problem here is clearly that Demi wants to reshape Hester Prynne from Puritan victim of Puritanism into a hot ass-kicking, erotically supercharged mama who connects as a kindred soul with local Native Americans and hosts a sort of women's consciousness-raising/sewing group. In colonial New England. Uh-huh. I kinda love this movie--it's so slick yet incredibly wrongheaded, encouraging possibly the worst performances ever by some very good actors (Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall for starters), that it's frequently hilarious. It's one of those rare crazy monuments to a star's ego--at the expense of any fidelity or credibility--that results in an instant camp classic.

    I have never read Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th century novel, but apparently this is total rape and murder of it. Admittedly Demi Moore's Hester is extremely irritating, like all of the movie's strrrooong women, and celebration of adultery would make poor, Victorian Nathaniel turn scarlet too, but production values are lush and the film is not without entertainment value. Think, for example, the hysterical scene where Hester (or whoever this modern woman among Puritans is) puts wreath of flowers to her head and runs in the woods like 17th century hippie! She is free spirit in narrow-minded, bigoted society, get it? As filmed version of Historical Harlequin book this is not bad at all, as Hawthorne adaptation it is, of course, insulting travesty and understandably angered book's fans.

    I can ensure you that The Scarlet Letter receives too much negative criticism. It's an easy target. I've never read the novel though I wish I did read it so I could better effectively rate the movie, but the book is great so the movie has big shoes to fill. The Scarlet Letter is clearly a fine film. Its direct comparisons to the book is one big reason for all the underratings, another big reason is The Scarlet Letter viewing sells itself as some great movie, with its vivid storytelling, its great acting and strong cinematography, yet it's not quite great. It's hard and difficult to deliver a pure dramatic period piece based on a strong selling novel. The movie may supposed to be sophisticated, elegant drama, but The Scarlet Letter quickly settles into a regular on the surface movie at the time when Authur and Hester meet, not being too artistically poetic, but more commonly driven by its desires. The Scarlet Letter is lost between those two film modes with no seaming connection. Another strong critique is it's missing very intriguing plot points. All this lessens the film, but not all so much. The Scarlet Letter is a passionate romance taking place in a beautiful though turbulent setting. It has a good, deep cast. Demi Moore and Gary Oldman as Hester Prynne and Authur Dimmsdale make The Scarlet Letter good all while their characters engage in forbidden lust. Moore and Oldman offer tour de forces in The Scarlet Letter. Moore is beauty at its finest. I love Demi Moore and Gary Oldman, two my favorite and two of the very best. I quite enjoy their impassioned performances in The Scarlet Letter. It may make the characters themselves slightly exaggerated, but Oldman and Moore do a good job of maintaining it. I wouldn't change it if I could. The Scarlet Letter is a great tragic love story in the form of a good movie. I must say, The Scarlet Letter is really good, and anyone who bashes it as bad is being too harsh. It's a strong 6. The Scarlet Letter is a great stay at home couples date night movie because it's boldly, desperately romantic and you do not have to watch it too closely to follow it as it speaks of pure passion being very passionately compelling.

    I generally dislike movie critics because I have really liked many movies they pan and I've not liked some movies they extolled. I think all of performances in The Scarlet Letter were spot on. Demi's portrayal of a woman taking a stand against rigid moral codes and repression of women was very well done. She avoided being too strident trying to walk the hard line between the mores of the 1700's and following the demands of her heart and body in her love for Rev. Dimmesdale. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors and I've never seen him give a bad performance. The tight control he's trying to keep when he's so in love and lusting after Hester is a wonder to watch. The Reverend's place in his church, his community and his faith is turned upside down putting his life in jeopardy preventing him from doing what he knows is right in speaking up to defend his love and claim his child. The scene in the barn when Hester and Arthur finally consummate their love is one of the most sensual and beautifully filmed love scenes I've ever seen. Since I love happier endings, I'm glad they took poetic license and did not strictly adhere to the book.

    This certainly ranks among the Top Ten of "What Were They Thinking?" films ever made. The production is sumptuously photographed, has a more than qualified director in Oscar nominee Roland Joffe, a recognizable supporting cast of Oscar luminaries featuring Gary Oldman, Robert Duvall and Joan Plowright, and a then-bankable leading lady in Demi Moore. Factor in the pedigree associated with Nathaniel Hawthorne's legendary novel and something far more worthwhile should have been the end result. Moore is cast as Hester Prynne, a proper Puritan wife sent ahead to the colonies to prepare a home for she and her husband. Emboldened by the new responsibilities thrust upon her and some of the new relationships she starts, Hester gives in to an attraction to the righteous Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Oldman) when it is believed that her husband has perished in an Indian massacre. Hester's peccadillo and her subsequent illegitimate pregnancy cause her to become persona non grata in the colony and she is forced to wear the scarlet letter of the title brandishing her an adulterer. Anyone who made it through high school is familiar with the tale of Hester Prynne, but given the issues inherent in the material and how it still remains pertinent in today's society with women's right being trampled on, its cinematic adaptations have been amazingly rare. So it is doubly unfortunate that Joffe and company have so succinctly bungled this effort. Moore is pretty as a picture, but entirely too contemporary a presence to convince as Hester. She provides neither the insight nor the range to make Hester's plight palpable. Oldman is solid and provides a titillating full frontal voyeuristic skinny-dip, but his role is beyond ridiculous (more on that later). Robert Duvall as Hester's wacko husband shows up later in the film and gives the worst performance of his career. This is so bad it is akin to the work Nick Nolte contributed in Hulk. And pretty much everyone is out-acted by a bird that seems to be chirping for sexual freedom. The film's biggest problem and the result of its failure is that it fails to have respect or even understand the entire point of the source. No one feels that Joffe needs to be slavishly faithful to Hawthorne's prose. And sexing the material up for modern audiences is also not an unwise call. However, what is absurd is basically castrating the story of its core. Joffe and company take the window dressing of the Scarlett Letter, but abandon its entire reason for being. Hawthorne's story was an indictment of Puritanism and the hypocrisy of Christianity in that Reverend Dimmesdale was a self-righteous blowhard stirring up his foolish flock and leading the charge against Hester by day, while being her lover at night and demanding she keep their secret. If anything, he is the villain of the piece, yet the film version somehow re-imagines him as a worthwhile, misunderstood romantic figure! Instead of Dimmesdale being depicted justly as a craven, cowardly monument of hypocrisy, we instead get Dimmesdale as the Puritan answer to Fabio and Duvall gets to usurp the villain role as Hester's wild-eyed madman hubby. This shift in narrative, plus changes in the latter half of the film including the ending, completely abandons the entire purpose of Hawthorne's tale. Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such, the film does not conclude, so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.

I felt immediately drawn to her character. *drum roll* Time for the one and only flaw! My main problem is the unnecessary amounts of gore. I won't say how it's gory, but if you haven't seen this yet, consider yourself warned. I understand that this is a device that only makes the film more powerful and intense, but truthfully, it's just plain hard to watch. OH! I just thought of another flaw. Mituba diddling herself with a candlestick. It might sound like a bad Clue scenario, but lo and behold . . . It's just unnecessary. So those are my two cents. If you're a hard-knock fan of the book, try to forget about it when watching this film. It really is great as an independent story, so just let your mind relax and sink into the creative depths of the directors' interpretation. And keep a pillow handy.

    I am not going to keep on comparing here, but this film as a film and an adaptation is a mess in my opinion. The book is one of the greatest American novels, and is so interesting and thoughtfully written. The film version of The Scarlet Letter does have exquisite costumes, scenery and cinematography, a lush John Barry score and despite the inconsistent accent and a slight need to over-compensate Gary Oldman is surprisingly credible as Dimmersdale. However, the script is trite and the storytelling is uninteresting, has little heart and has some overly-gratuitous scenes such as the bathing scene. The pace is also uneven, some of it is too quick while other scenes are ponderous and stilted. The direction feels lacking, and you know there's something wrong when Oldman gives the only half-decent performance. I love Edward Hardwicke and Joan Plowright but they have awful dialogue and their characters are not written well at all. Robert Duvall is embarrassing here, and that pained me to say that as he is usually brilliant. Worst of all is Demi Moore, I don't hate Moore as much as some do(I liked her very much in Ghost, A Few Good Men and The Hunchback of Notre Dame) but she is very bland and not very believable at all as Hester. Overall, disappointing and a failure film and adaptation-wise. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    This is one of the worst major-studio literary adaptations ever, and I've given it a 1 rating because it deserves to be in the IMDb bottom 100--though in terms of (unintentionally hilarious) entertainment value I'd give it a 6. Maybe even an 8. I'm no huge fan of Hawthorne--his novels are pretty dry, dull and moralistic, like much pre-20th-century American lit--but his whole story is outrageously skewed here to suit Demi Moore's ego. She was at the top of her stardom then. This, "G.I. Jane" and "Striptease" pretty much destroyed that status--and all because each of them was wrecked by the need to flatter her so much. She needs to be the toughest yet most sensitive, sexiest yet most spiritual, etc. etc. person on screen--which would be OK if she were playing an action heroine or female superhero, but was disastrous for these particular stories. "G.I. Jane" could have been a gritty look at women's military life, "Striptease" has considerable sequences--all without Demi--where it's a very funny retro screwball comedy. But her humorless image-sculpting ruined both. Then there's "Scarlet Letter." Whoa. Roland Joffe is not a good director (despite having gotten praise for the fairly good "Killing Fields" and overrated "The Mission"--since then it's been all downhill). But the problem here is clearly that Demi wants to reshape Hester Prynne from Puritan victim of Puritanism into a hot ass-kicking, erotically supercharged mama who connects as a kindred soul with local Native Americans and hosts a sort of women's consciousness-raising/sewing group. In colonial New England. Uh-huh. I kinda love this movie--it's so slick yet incredibly wrongheaded, encouraging possibly the worst performances ever by some very good actors (Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall for starters), that it's frequently hilarious. It's one of those rare crazy monuments to a star's ego--at the expense of any fidelity or credibility--that results in an instant camp classic.

    I have never read Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th century novel, but apparently this is total rape and murder of it. Admittedly Demi Moore's Hester is extremely irritating, like all of the movie's strrrooong women, and celebration of adultery would make poor, Victorian Nathaniel turn scarlet too, but production values are lush and the film is not without entertainment value. Think, for example, the hysterical scene where Hester (or whoever this modern woman among Puritans is) puts wreath of flowers to her head and runs in the woods like 17th century hippie! She is free spirit in narrow-minded, bigoted society, get it? As filmed version of Historical Harlequin book this is not bad at all, as Hawthorne adaptation it is, of course, insulting travesty and understandably angered book's fans.
