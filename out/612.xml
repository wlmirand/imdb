    Utopia that exists deep in every one of us. The feeling that forced few people to reconstruct this movie. This filmography treasure is seriously achievement for its time. Even the few scratches, made by the force of the passed time, ca not in no way wound its corpus because they are carefully cured by those people. The place in the soul of everyone that has to be his destination. Whether it exists or it is possible to be reached - this is the question: are you going to believe it? I believe and strongly hope the second world loss of horizon to be the last loss of horizon. That we acquired with working compass that will guide us from now on, flawlessly. Interesting will be the parallel 1937 - 1973, although we can easily stop here because such an end would be an excellent beginning!

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Capra's Fantasy Still Works After All These Years

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    Utopia that exists deep in every one of us. The feeling that forced few people to reconstruct this movie. This filmography treasure is seriously achievement for its time. Even the few scratches, made by the force of the passed time, ca not in no way wound its corpus because they are carefully cured by those people. The place in the soul of everyone that has to be his destination. Whether it exists or it is possible to be reached - this is the question: are you going to believe it? I believe and strongly hope the second world loss of horizon to be the last loss of horizon. That we acquired with working compass that will guide us from now on, flawlessly. Interesting will be the parallel 1937 - 1973, although we can easily stop here because such an end would be an excellent beginning!

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    Utopia that exists deep in every one of us. The feeling that forced few people to reconstruct this movie. This filmography treasure is seriously achievement for its time. Even the few scratches, made by the force of the passed time, ca not in no way wound its corpus because they are carefully cured by those people. The place in the soul of everyone that has to be his destination. Whether it exists or it is possible to be reached - this is the question: are you going to believe it? I believe and strongly hope the second world loss of horizon to be the last loss of horizon. That we acquired with working compass that will guide us from now on, flawlessly. Interesting will be the parallel 1937 - 1973, although we can easily stop here because such an end would be an excellent beginning!

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    Utopia that exists deep in every one of us. The feeling that forced few people to reconstruct this movie. This filmography treasure is seriously achievement for its time. Even the few scratches, made by the force of the passed time, ca not in no way wound its corpus because they are carefully cured by those people. The place in the soul of everyone that has to be his destination. Whether it exists or it is possible to be reached - this is the question: are you going to believe it? I believe and strongly hope the second world loss of horizon to be the last loss of horizon. That we acquired with working compass that will guide us from now on, flawlessly. Interesting will be the parallel 1937 - 1973, although we can easily stop here because such an end would be an excellent beginning!

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    Utopia that exists deep in every one of us. The feeling that forced few people to reconstruct this movie. This filmography treasure is seriously achievement for its time. Even the few scratches, made by the force of the passed time, ca not in no way wound its corpus because they are carefully cured by those people. The place in the soul of everyone that has to be his destination. Whether it exists or it is possible to be reached - this is the question: are you going to believe it? I believe and strongly hope the second world loss of horizon to be the last loss of horizon. That we acquired with working compass that will guide us from now on, flawlessly. Interesting will be the parallel 1937 - 1973, although we can easily stop here because such an end would be an excellent beginning!

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    Utopia that exists deep in every one of us. The feeling that forced few people to reconstruct this movie. This filmography treasure is seriously achievement for its time. Even the few scratches, made by the force of the passed time, ca not in no way wound its corpus because they are carefully cured by those people. The place in the soul of everyone that has to be his destination. Whether it exists or it is possible to be reached - this is the question: are you going to believe it? I believe and strongly hope the second world loss of horizon to be the last loss of horizon. That we acquired with working compass that will guide us from now on, flawlessly. Interesting will be the parallel 1937 - 1973, although we can easily stop here because such an end would be an excellent beginning!

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    Utopia that exists deep in every one of us. The feeling that forced few people to reconstruct this movie. This filmography treasure is seriously achievement for its time. Even the few scratches, made by the force of the passed time, ca not in no way wound its corpus because they are carefully cured by those people. The place in the soul of everyone that has to be his destination. Whether it exists or it is possible to be reached - this is the question: are you going to believe it? I believe and strongly hope the second world loss of horizon to be the last loss of horizon. That we acquired with working compass that will guide us from now on, flawlessly. Interesting will be the parallel 1937 - 1973, although we can easily stop here because such an end would be an excellent beginning!

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

    Utopia that exists deep in every one of us. The feeling that forced few people to reconstruct this movie. This filmography treasure is seriously achievement for its time. Even the few scratches, made by the force of the passed time, ca not in no way wound its corpus because they are carefully cured by those people. The place in the soul of everyone that has to be his destination. Whether it exists or it is possible to be reached - this is the question: are you going to believe it? I believe and strongly hope the second world loss of horizon to be the last loss of horizon. That we acquired with working compass that will guide us from now on, flawlessly. Interesting will be the parallel 1937 - 1973, although we can easily stop here because such an end would be an excellent beginning!

    This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch. Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue. The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight. The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another. There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy. H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous. The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today. The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clich&eacute;d Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clich&eacute;s turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved. Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?

    This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity. The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes. The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense. The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails. As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail). The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.

    Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid. In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.

    It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.

    This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best"). As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual. But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10". There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!

    The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them. The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does. But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves. This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture. It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.

    That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood

    One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story. Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La. After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life. Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom. Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley. Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process. Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom. The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions. It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films. The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled. This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.

    I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length. First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work. To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?" As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better. I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious. This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality. Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.

    Capra's Fantasy Still Works After All These Years

    Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.
