 <sinopse>
  Three astronauts must devise a strategy to return to Earth safely after their spacecraft undergoes massive internal damage.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Based on the true story of the ill-fated 13th Apollo mission bound for the moon. Astronauts Lovell, Haise and Swigert were scheduled to fly Apollo 14, but are moved up to 13. It's 1970, and America have already achieved their lunar landing goal, so there's little interest in this "routine" flight.. until that is, things go very wrong, and prospects of a safe return fade.

    This film is based on the true events that occurred in space in 1970. Obviously, you know that. I don't know why I started this review like that but I did. It has Tom Hanks. He plays Jim Lovell, an astronaut that has been to space a lot. He decides he wants to go back to the moon with 2 other guys. During the launch there's a problem. But you'll figure that out 45 minutes into the movie. I'm gonna tell you anyway. Something brakes on the ship that makes the oxygen level go down. It's all over the news. Millions of people come to Lovell's house because they're so worried about what'll happen. Meanwhile the crew tries to get back home. They even pass the moon. In the end, they come back landing at Houston. Everybody's fine (until the movie loses the academy award to Braveheart) I'd say Apollo 13 is a good space movie to watch during a Taco Night. YAY!!!!!!!

    I liked this movie. It was an okay watch, and it had some suspenseful moments. However, it was just too slow. Almost the entire two hours of the movie seemed to take place in the ship, or mission control. Obviously they couldn't do much more than that, since it is a true story, but I felt it was too long for what it was. Some movies, such as "The Breakfast Club" manage to pull off a fantastic movie in only one or two areas for the entire film. Overall, it was a pretty good watch, and it's definitely a classic, but the movie probably would have done better without dragging on so long, and probably should have been shortened by about half an hour.

    This is clearly one of my favorite movies in recent years. Even though some dramatic license is taken, it's still better than The Right Stuff, which it's often compared to. This film is taken from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon, rather than a fiction book like Tom Wolfe's It also portrays the characters with more respect than that film, although Jack Sweigert was NOT a "rookie" by any means, and Ken Mattingly didn't solve the CM restart by himself (but it is mentioned that Ken was representing all those who did help out with this. This is a movie I would see over and over again. Even Gene Kranz liked the line "Failure is not an option," though he never said it. That's saying something! Kudos to Ron Howard.

    By-the-numbers B.S. about the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon flight. Tom (Shoots) Blanks was cast as Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. Hanks' squirrelly voice will grate on you for over 2 hours if you last that long before you: 1. Fall asleep on the couch, 2. Realize you could have more fun cleaning out the bird cage, or 3. Use the DVD as a Frisbee by heaving it into the field down the street. The director (and I use that term loosely) Ron "Opie" Howard once again exhibits his own personal patented tripe which he tries to pass off as directorial abilities. All the predictable special effects clich&eacute;s, including a plethora or historical inaccuracies, fester on the screen, and it's all Dopey Opie's fault. Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton are about the worst actors Howard could have chosen for this dishonest garbage. From the filthy sex jokes early in the movie to having two of the astronauts point fingers at one another concerning the cause of the disaster, this flick isn't good enough for the birds, which is totally logical since the film just doesn't fly. If you want to see the TRUE story of what happened to Apollo 13, go to Youtube and watch the NASA film 'Houston, We've Got A Problem'. That film is well-produced, has much better direction, and is infinitely more interesting than the Failure Club of Howard, Hanks, and the other idiots found here. Rating: 0 stars out a possible 10. Poor Dopey Opie. May he get run over by a locomotive at 9:30 tonight.

    Apollo 13 **** (out of 4) 136 mins / PG Cast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe Spano Director: Ron Howard Plot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines "Houston, we have a problem", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

    I believe Jim Lovell made a cameo at the end of the movie Apollo 13. The shot of him is very brief. Once the capsule has landed in the water and the crew is then is hauled up to the waiting helicopter. The helicopter then lands upon the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima. The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot. Next time you watch the movie give it a glance and see what you think. I researched the real Apollo13 and photos of the actual astronauts.Thats how I came about to recognize who I think is Lovell in the movie.

    I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how "right" they "got it". I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to "modernize" styles, not trusting the audience to "get it", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deepjust dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood. Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them. A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a "story" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives. The acting was good, but the writing was often clich&eacute;d. A lot of it reminded me of things like "Back To Bataan" or the "Sands of Iwo Jima", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing "A" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting. A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to bemainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.) But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.

    The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.

    "Houston, we have a problem". This historical recounting of the failed NASA mission that succeeded in so many ways is a magical recreation of space flight into that final frontier. Ron Howard pulls the viewer heartstrings that previously limited his critical success. We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride. The Jim Lovell story comes to life through strong performance and a clear vision that remains as awe inspiring as space travel itself was in its youth.

    This movie is one of the best true story movies in that it tires to portray what actually happened on the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission. There was a lovely cameo by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were played by actors since the real ones were too old by the time this movie was made. This movie is sad, but had to be so because it was based on a real life tragic event were Apollo 13 was so crippled int he service module that they had to terminate the moon landing and come home alive. A serious lesson from Apollo 13 is that things can go wrong. This was one of the seven best astronomy movies according to Astronomy Magazine. I do like the historical accuracy of this movie.

I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

    I believe Jim Lovell made a cameo at the end of the movie Apollo 13. The shot of him is very brief. Once the capsule has landed in the water and the crew is then is hauled up to the waiting helicopter. The helicopter then lands upon the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima. The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot. Next time you watch the movie give it a glance and see what you think. I researched the real Apollo13 and photos of the actual astronauts.Thats how I came about to recognize who I think is Lovell in the movie.

    I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how "right" they "got it". I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to "modernize" styles, not trusting the audience to "get it", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deepjust dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood. Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them. A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a "story" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives. The acting was good, but the writing was often clich&eacute;d. A lot of it reminded me of things like "Back To Bataan" or the "Sands of Iwo Jima", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing "A" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting. A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to bemainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.) But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.

    The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.

    "Houston, we have a problem". This historical recounting of the failed NASA mission that succeeded in so many ways is a magical recreation of space flight into that final frontier. Ron Howard pulls the viewer heartstrings that previously limited his critical success. We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride. The Jim Lovell story comes to life through strong performance and a clear vision that remains as awe inspiring as space travel itself was in its youth.

    This movie is one of the best true story movies in that it tires to portray what actually happened on the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission. There was a lovely cameo by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were played by actors since the real ones were too old by the time this movie was made. This movie is sad, but had to be so because it was based on a real life tragic event were Apollo 13 was so crippled int he service module that they had to terminate the moon landing and come home alive. A serious lesson from Apollo 13 is that things can go wrong. This was one of the seven best astronomy movies according to Astronomy Magazine. I do like the historical accuracy of this movie.

    This film is based on the true events that occurred in space in 1970. Obviously, you know that. I don't know why I started this review like that but I did. It has Tom Hanks. He plays Jim Lovell, an astronaut that has been to space a lot. He decides he wants to go back to the moon with 2 other guys. During the launch there's a problem. But you'll figure that out 45 minutes into the movie. I'm gonna tell you anyway. Something brakes on the ship that makes the oxygen level go down. It's all over the news. Millions of people come to Lovell's house because they're so worried about what'll happen. Meanwhile the crew tries to get back home. They even pass the moon. In the end, they come back landing at Houston. Everybody's fine (until the movie loses the academy award to Braveheart) I'd say Apollo 13 is a good space movie to watch during a Taco Night. YAY!!!!!!!

    I liked this movie. It was an okay watch, and it had some suspenseful moments. However, it was just too slow. Almost the entire two hours of the movie seemed to take place in the ship, or mission control. Obviously they couldn't do much more than that, since it is a true story, but I felt it was too long for what it was. Some movies, such as "The Breakfast Club" manage to pull off a fantastic movie in only one or two areas for the entire film. Overall, it was a pretty good watch, and it's definitely a classic, but the movie probably would have done better without dragging on so long, and probably should have been shortened by about half an hour.

    This is clearly one of my favorite movies in recent years. Even though some dramatic license is taken, it's still better than The Right Stuff, which it's often compared to. This film is taken from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon, rather than a fiction book like Tom Wolfe's It also portrays the characters with more respect than that film, although Jack Sweigert was NOT a "rookie" by any means, and Ken Mattingly didn't solve the CM restart by himself (but it is mentioned that Ken was representing all those who did help out with this. This is a movie I would see over and over again. Even Gene Kranz liked the line "Failure is not an option," though he never said it. That's saying something! Kudos to Ron Howard.

    By-the-numbers B.S. about the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon flight. Tom (Shoots) Blanks was cast as Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. Hanks' squirrelly voice will grate on you for over 2 hours if you last that long before you: 1. Fall asleep on the couch, 2. Realize you could have more fun cleaning out the bird cage, or 3. Use the DVD as a Frisbee by heaving it into the field down the street. The director (and I use that term loosely) Ron "Opie" Howard once again exhibits his own personal patented tripe which he tries to pass off as directorial abilities. All the predictable special effects clich&eacute;s, including a plethora or historical inaccuracies, fester on the screen, and it's all Dopey Opie's fault. Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton are about the worst actors Howard could have chosen for this dishonest garbage. From the filthy sex jokes early in the movie to having two of the astronauts point fingers at one another concerning the cause of the disaster, this flick isn't good enough for the birds, which is totally logical since the film just doesn't fly. If you want to see the TRUE story of what happened to Apollo 13, go to Youtube and watch the NASA film 'Houston, We've Got A Problem'. That film is well-produced, has much better direction, and is infinitely more interesting than the Failure Club of Howard, Hanks, and the other idiots found here. Rating: 0 stars out a possible 10. Poor Dopey Opie. May he get run over by a locomotive at 9:30 tonight.

    Apollo 13 **** (out of 4) 136 mins / PG Cast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe Spano Director: Ron Howard Plot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines "Houston, we have a problem", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.

    "Houston, we have a problem". This historical recounting of the failed NASA mission that succeeded in so many ways is a magical recreation of space flight into that final frontier. Ron Howard pulls the viewer heartstrings that previously limited his critical success. We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride. The Jim Lovell story comes to life through strong performance and a clear vision that remains as awe inspiring as space travel itself was in its youth.

    This movie is one of the best true story movies in that it tires to portray what actually happened on the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission. There was a lovely cameo by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were played by actors since the real ones were too old by the time this movie was made. This movie is sad, but had to be so because it was based on a real life tragic event were Apollo 13 was so crippled int he service module that they had to terminate the moon landing and come home alive. A serious lesson from Apollo 13 is that things can go wrong. This was one of the seven best astronomy movies according to Astronomy Magazine. I do like the historical accuracy of this movie.

    This film is based on the true events that occurred in space in 1970. Obviously, you know that. I don't know why I started this review like that but I did. It has Tom Hanks. He plays Jim Lovell, an astronaut that has been to space a lot. He decides he wants to go back to the moon with 2 other guys. During the launch there's a problem. But you'll figure that out 45 minutes into the movie. I'm gonna tell you anyway. Something brakes on the ship that makes the oxygen level go down. It's all over the news. Millions of people come to Lovell's house because they're so worried about what'll happen. Meanwhile the crew tries to get back home. They even pass the moon. In the end, they come back landing at Houston. Everybody's fine (until the movie loses the academy award to Braveheart) I'd say Apollo 13 is a good space movie to watch during a Taco Night. YAY!!!!!!!

    I liked this movie. It was an okay watch, and it had some suspenseful moments. However, it was just too slow. Almost the entire two hours of the movie seemed to take place in the ship, or mission control. Obviously they couldn't do much more than that, since it is a true story, but I felt it was too long for what it was. Some movies, such as "The Breakfast Club" manage to pull off a fantastic movie in only one or two areas for the entire film. Overall, it was a pretty good watch, and it's definitely a classic, but the movie probably would have done better without dragging on so long, and probably should have been shortened by about half an hour.

    This is clearly one of my favorite movies in recent years. Even though some dramatic license is taken, it's still better than The Right Stuff, which it's often compared to. This film is taken from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon, rather than a fiction book like Tom Wolfe's It also portrays the characters with more respect than that film, although Jack Sweigert was NOT a "rookie" by any means, and Ken Mattingly didn't solve the CM restart by himself (but it is mentioned that Ken was representing all those who did help out with this. This is a movie I would see over and over again. Even Gene Kranz liked the line "Failure is not an option," though he never said it. That's saying something! Kudos to Ron Howard.

    By-the-numbers B.S. about the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon flight. Tom (Shoots) Blanks was cast as Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. Hanks' squirrelly voice will grate on you for over 2 hours if you last that long before you: 1. Fall asleep on the couch, 2. Realize you could have more fun cleaning out the bird cage, or 3. Use the DVD as a Frisbee by heaving it into the field down the street. The director (and I use that term loosely) Ron "Opie" Howard once again exhibits his own personal patented tripe which he tries to pass off as directorial abilities. All the predictable special effects clich&eacute;s, including a plethora or historical inaccuracies, fester on the screen, and it's all Dopey Opie's fault. Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton are about the worst actors Howard could have chosen for this dishonest garbage. From the filthy sex jokes early in the movie to having two of the astronauts point fingers at one another concerning the cause of the disaster, this flick isn't good enough for the birds, which is totally logical since the film just doesn't fly. If you want to see the TRUE story of what happened to Apollo 13, go to Youtube and watch the NASA film 'Houston, We've Got A Problem'. That film is well-produced, has much better direction, and is infinitely more interesting than the Failure Club of Howard, Hanks, and the other idiots found here. Rating: 0 stars out a possible 10. Poor Dopey Opie. May he get run over by a locomotive at 9:30 tonight.

    Apollo 13 **** (out of 4) 136 mins / PG Cast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe Spano Director: Ron Howard Plot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines "Houston, we have a problem", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

    I believe Jim Lovell made a cameo at the end of the movie Apollo 13. The shot of him is very brief. Once the capsule has landed in the water and the crew is then is hauled up to the waiting helicopter. The helicopter then lands upon the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima. The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot. Next time you watch the movie give it a glance and see what you think. I researched the real Apollo13 and photos of the actual astronauts.Thats how I came about to recognize who I think is Lovell in the movie.

    I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how "right" they "got it". I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to "modernize" styles, not trusting the audience to "get it", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deepjust dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood. Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them. A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a "story" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives. The acting was good, but the writing was often clich&eacute;d. A lot of it reminded me of things like "Back To Bataan" or the "Sands of Iwo Jima", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing "A" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting. A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to bemainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.) But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.

    The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10!

It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

    I believe Jim Lovell made a cameo at the end of the movie Apollo 13. The shot of him is very brief. Once the capsule has landed in the water and the crew is then is hauled up to the waiting helicopter. The helicopter then lands upon the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima. The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot. Next time you watch the movie give it a glance and see what you think. I researched the real Apollo13 and photos of the actual astronauts.Thats how I came about to recognize who I think is Lovell in the movie.

    I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how "right" they "got it". I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to "modernize" styles, not trusting the audience to "get it", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deepjust dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood. Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them. A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a "story" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives. The acting was good, but the writing was often clich&eacute;d. A lot of it reminded me of things like "Back To Bataan" or the "Sands of Iwo Jima", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing "A" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting. A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to bemainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.) But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.

    The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.

    "Houston, we have a problem". This historical recounting of the failed NASA mission that succeeded in so many ways is a magical recreation of space flight into that final frontier. Ron Howard pulls the viewer heartstrings that previously limited his critical success. We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride. The Jim Lovell story comes to life through strong performance and a clear vision that remains as awe inspiring as space travel itself was in its youth.

    This movie is one of the best true story movies in that it tires to portray what actually happened on the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission. There was a lovely cameo by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were played by actors since the real ones were too old by the time this movie was made. This movie is sad, but had to be so because it was based on a real life tragic event were Apollo 13 was so crippled int he service module that they had to terminate the moon landing and come home alive. A serious lesson from Apollo 13 is that things can go wrong. This was one of the seven best astronomy movies according to Astronomy Magazine. I do like the historical accuracy of this movie.

    This film is based on the true events that occurred in space in 1970. Obviously, you know that. I don't know why I started this review like that but I did. It has Tom Hanks. He plays Jim Lovell, an astronaut that has been to space a lot. He decides he wants to go back to the moon with 2 other guys. During the launch there's a problem. But you'll figure that out 45 minutes into the movie. I'm gonna tell you anyway. Something brakes on the ship that makes the oxygen level go down. It's all over the news. Millions of people come to Lovell's house because they're so worried about what'll happen. Meanwhile the crew tries to get back home. They even pass the moon. In the end, they come back landing at Houston. Everybody's fine (until the movie loses the academy award to Braveheart) I'd say Apollo 13 is a good space movie to watch during a Taco Night. YAY!!!!!!!

    I liked this movie. It was an okay watch, and it had some suspenseful moments. However, it was just too slow. Almost the entire two hours of the movie seemed to take place in the ship, or mission control. Obviously they couldn't do much more than that, since it is a true story, but I felt it was too long for what it was. Some movies, such as "The Breakfast Club" manage to pull off a fantastic movie in only one or two areas for the entire film. Overall, it was a pretty good watch, and it's definitely a classic, but the movie probably would have done better without dragging on so long, and probably should have been shortened by about half an hour.

    This is clearly one of my favorite movies in recent years. Even though some dramatic license is taken, it's still better than The Right Stuff, which it's often compared to. This film is taken from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon, rather than a fiction book like Tom Wolfe's It also portrays the characters with more respect than that film, although Jack Sweigert was NOT a "rookie" by any means, and Ken Mattingly didn't solve the CM restart by himself (but it is mentioned that Ken was representing all those who did help out with this. This is a movie I would see over and over again. Even Gene Kranz liked the line "Failure is not an option," though he never said it. That's saying something! Kudos to Ron Howard.

    By-the-numbers B.S. about the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon flight. Tom (Shoots) Blanks was cast as Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. Hanks' squirrelly voice will grate on you for over 2 hours if you last that long before you: 1. Fall asleep on the couch, 2. Realize you could have more fun cleaning out the bird cage, or 3. Use the DVD as a Frisbee by heaving it into the field down the street. The director (and I use that term loosely) Ron "Opie" Howard once again exhibits his own personal patented tripe which he tries to pass off as directorial abilities. All the predictable special effects clich&eacute;s, including a plethora or historical inaccuracies, fester on the screen, and it's all Dopey Opie's fault. Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton are about the worst actors Howard could have chosen for this dishonest garbage. From the filthy sex jokes early in the movie to having two of the astronauts point fingers at one another concerning the cause of the disaster, this flick isn't good enough for the birds, which is totally logical since the film just doesn't fly. If you want to see the TRUE story of what happened to Apollo 13, go to Youtube and watch the NASA film 'Houston, We've Got A Problem'. That film is well-produced, has much better direction, and is infinitely more interesting than the Failure Club of Howard, Hanks, and the other idiots found here. Rating: 0 stars out a possible 10. Poor Dopey Opie. May he get run over by a locomotive at 9:30 tonight.

    Apollo 13 **** (out of 4) 136 mins / PG Cast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe Spano Director: Ron Howard Plot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines "Houston, we have a problem", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind.

Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene.

It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.

    "Houston, we have a problem". This historical recounting of the failed NASA mission that succeeded in so many ways is a magical recreation of space flight into that final frontier. Ron Howard pulls the viewer heartstrings that previously limited his critical success. We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride. The Jim Lovell story comes to life through strong performance and a clear vision that remains as awe inspiring as space travel itself was in its youth.

    This movie is one of the best true story movies in that it tires to portray what actually happened on the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission. There was a lovely cameo by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were played by actors since the real ones were too old by the time this movie was made. This movie is sad, but had to be so because it was based on a real life tragic event were Apollo 13 was so crippled int he service module that they had to terminate the moon landing and come home alive. A serious lesson from Apollo 13 is that things can go wrong. This was one of the seven best astronomy movies according to Astronomy Magazine. I do like the historical accuracy of this movie.

    This film is based on the true events that occurred in space in 1970. Obviously, you know that. I don't know why I started this review like that but I did. It has Tom Hanks. He plays Jim Lovell, an astronaut that has been to space a lot. He decides he wants to go back to the moon with 2 other guys. During the launch there's a problem. But you'll figure that out 45 minutes into the movie. I'm gonna tell you anyway. Something brakes on the ship that makes the oxygen level go down. It's all over the news. Millions of people come to Lovell's house because they're so worried about what'll happen. Meanwhile the crew tries to get back home. They even pass the moon. In the end, they come back landing at Houston. Everybody's fine (until the movie loses the academy award to Braveheart) I'd say Apollo 13 is a good space movie to watch during a Taco Night. YAY!!!!!!!

    I liked this movie. It was an okay watch, and it had some suspenseful moments. However, it was just too slow. Almost the entire two hours of the movie seemed to take place in the ship, or mission control. Obviously they couldn't do much more than that, since it is a true story, but I felt it was too long for what it was. Some movies, such as "The Breakfast Club" manage to pull off a fantastic movie in only one or two areas for the entire film. Overall, it was a pretty good watch, and it's definitely a classic, but the movie probably would have done better without dragging on so long, and probably should have been shortened by about half an hour.

    This is clearly one of my favorite movies in recent years. Even though some dramatic license is taken, it's still better than The Right Stuff, which it's often compared to. This film is taken from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon, rather than a fiction book like Tom Wolfe's It also portrays the characters with more respect than that film, although Jack Sweigert was NOT a "rookie" by any means, and Ken Mattingly didn't solve the CM restart by himself (but it is mentioned that Ken was representing all those who did help out with this. This is a movie I would see over and over again. Even Gene Kranz liked the line "Failure is not an option," though he never said it. That's saying something! Kudos to Ron Howard.

    By-the-numbers B.S. about the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon flight. Tom (Shoots) Blanks was cast as Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. Hanks' squirrelly voice will grate on you for over 2 hours if you last that long before you: 1. Fall asleep on the couch, 2. Realize you could have more fun cleaning out the bird cage, or 3. Use the DVD as a Frisbee by heaving it into the field down the street. The director (and I use that term loosely) Ron "Opie" Howard once again exhibits his own personal patented tripe which he tries to pass off as directorial abilities. All the predictable special effects clich&eacute;s, including a plethora or historical inaccuracies, fester on the screen, and it's all Dopey Opie's fault. Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton are about the worst actors Howard could have chosen for this dishonest garbage. From the filthy sex jokes early in the movie to having two of the astronauts point fingers at one another concerning the cause of the disaster, this flick isn't good enough for the birds, which is totally logical since the film just doesn't fly. If you want to see the TRUE story of what happened to Apollo 13, go to Youtube and watch the NASA film 'Houston, We've Got A Problem'. That film is well-produced, has much better direction, and is infinitely more interesting than the Failure Club of Howard, Hanks, and the other idiots found here. Rating: 0 stars out a possible 10. Poor Dopey Opie. May he get run over by a locomotive at 9:30 tonight.

    Apollo 13 **** (out of 4) 136 mins / PG Cast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe Spano Director: Ron Howard Plot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines "Houston, we have a problem", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

    I believe Jim Lovell made a cameo at the end of the movie Apollo 13. The shot of him is very brief. Once the capsule has landed in the water and the crew is then is hauled up to the waiting helicopter. The helicopter then lands upon the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima. The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot. Next time you watch the movie give it a glance and see what you think. I researched the real Apollo13 and photos of the actual astronauts.Thats how I came about to recognize who I think is Lovell in the movie.

    I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how "right" they "got it". I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to "modernize" styles, not trusting the audience to "get it", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deepjust dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood. Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them. A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a "story" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives. The acting was good, but the writing was often clich&eacute;d. A lot of it reminded me of things like "Back To Bataan" or the "Sands of Iwo Jima", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing "A" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting. A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to bemainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.) But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.

    The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through.

When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines "Houston, we have a problem", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

    I believe Jim Lovell made a cameo at the end of the movie Apollo 13. The shot of him is very brief. Once the capsule has landed in the water and the crew is then is hauled up to the waiting helicopter. The helicopter then lands upon the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima. The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot. Next time you watch the movie give it a glance and see what you think. I researched the real Apollo13 and photos of the actual astronauts.Thats how I came about to recognize who I think is Lovell in the movie.

    I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how "right" they "got it". I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to "modernize" styles, not trusting the audience to "get it", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deepjust dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood. Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them. A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a "story" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives. The acting was good, but the writing was often clich&eacute;d. A lot of it reminded me of things like "Back To Bataan" or the "Sands of Iwo Jima", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing "A" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting. A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to bemainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.) But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.

    The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.

    "Houston, we have a problem". This historical recounting of the failed NASA mission that succeeded in so many ways is a magical recreation of space flight into that final frontier. Ron Howard pulls the viewer heartstrings that previously limited his critical success. We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride. The Jim Lovell story comes to life through strong performance and a clear vision that remains as awe inspiring as space travel itself was in its youth.

    This movie is one of the best true story movies in that it tires to portray what actually happened on the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission. There was a lovely cameo by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were played by actors since the real ones were too old by the time this movie was made. This movie is sad, but had to be so because it was based on a real life tragic event were Apollo 13 was so crippled int he service module that they had to terminate the moon landing and come home alive. A serious lesson from Apollo 13 is that things can go wrong. This was one of the seven best astronomy movies according to Astronomy Magazine. I do like the historical accuracy of this movie.

    This film is based on the true events that occurred in space in 1970. Obviously, you know that. I don't know why I started this review like that but I did. It has Tom Hanks. He plays Jim Lovell, an astronaut that has been to space a lot. He decides he wants to go back to the moon with 2 other guys. During the launch there's a problem. But you'll figure that out 45 minutes into the movie. I'm gonna tell you anyway. Something brakes on the ship that makes the oxygen level go down. It's all over the news. Millions of people come to Lovell's house because they're so worried about what'll happen. Meanwhile the crew tries to get back home. They even pass the moon. In the end, they come back landing at Houston. Everybody's fine (until the movie loses the academy award to Braveheart) I'd say Apollo 13 is a good space movie to watch during a Taco Night. YAY!!!!!!!

    I liked this movie. It was an okay watch, and it had some suspenseful moments. However, it was just too slow. Almost the entire two hours of the movie seemed to take place in the ship, or mission control. Obviously they couldn't do much more than that, since it is a true story, but I felt it was too long for what it was. Some movies, such as "The Breakfast Club" manage to pull off a fantastic movie in only one or two areas for the entire film. Overall, it was a pretty good watch, and it's definitely a classic, but the movie probably would have done better without dragging on so long, and probably should have been shortened by about half an hour.

    This is clearly one of my favorite movies in recent years. Even though some dramatic license is taken, it's still better than The Right Stuff, which it's often compared to. This film is taken from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon, rather than a fiction book like Tom Wolfe's It also portrays the characters with more respect than that film, although Jack Sweigert was NOT a "rookie" by any means, and Ken Mattingly didn't solve the CM restart by himself (but it is mentioned that Ken was representing all those who did help out with this. This is a movie I would see over and over again. Even Gene Kranz liked the line "Failure is not an option," though he never said it. That's saying something! Kudos to Ron Howard.

    By-the-numbers B.S. about the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon flight. Tom (Shoots) Blanks was cast as Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. Hanks' squirrelly voice will grate on you for over 2 hours if you last that long before you: 1. Fall asleep on the couch, 2. Realize you could have more fun cleaning out the bird cage, or 3. Use the DVD as a Frisbee by heaving it into the field down the street. The director (and I use that term loosely) Ron "Opie" Howard once again exhibits his own personal patented tripe which he tries to pass off as directorial abilities. All the predictable special effects clich&eacute;s, including a plethora or historical inaccuracies, fester on the screen, and it's all Dopey Opie's fault. Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton are about the worst actors Howard could have chosen for this dishonest garbage. From the filthy sex jokes early in the movie to having two of the astronauts point fingers at one another concerning the cause of the disaster, this flick isn't good enough for the birds, which is totally logical since the film just doesn't fly. If you want to see the TRUE story of what happened to Apollo 13, go to Youtube and watch the NASA film 'Houston, We've Got A Problem'. That film is well-produced, has much better direction, and is infinitely more interesting than the Failure Club of Howard, Hanks, and the other idiots found here. Rating: 0 stars out a possible 10. Poor Dopey Opie. May he get run over by a locomotive at 9:30 tonight.

    Apollo 13 **** (out of 4) 136 mins / PG Cast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe Spano Director: Ron Howard Plot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late.

    The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.

    "Houston, we have a problem". This historical recounting of the failed NASA mission that succeeded in so many ways is a magical recreation of space flight into that final frontier. Ron Howard pulls the viewer heartstrings that previously limited his critical success. We're reminded of the lost trait of American ingenuity as inspirationally seen through the determined NASA team where failure was not an option. Just like the mission, this was not about individual performances and energized American pride. The Jim Lovell story comes to life through strong performance and a clear vision that remains as awe inspiring as space travel itself was in its youth.

    This movie is one of the best true story movies in that it tires to portray what actually happened on the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission. There was a lovely cameo by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were played by actors since the real ones were too old by the time this movie was made. This movie is sad, but had to be so because it was based on a real life tragic event were Apollo 13 was so crippled int he service module that they had to terminate the moon landing and come home alive. A serious lesson from Apollo 13 is that things can go wrong. This was one of the seven best astronomy movies according to Astronomy Magazine. I do like the historical accuracy of this movie.

    This film is based on the true events that occurred in space in 1970. Obviously, you know that. I don't know why I started this review like that but I did. It has Tom Hanks. He plays Jim Lovell, an astronaut that has been to space a lot. He decides he wants to go back to the moon with 2 other guys. During the launch there's a problem. But you'll figure that out 45 minutes into the movie. I'm gonna tell you anyway. Something brakes on the ship that makes the oxygen level go down. It's all over the news. Millions of people come to Lovell's house because they're so worried about what'll happen. Meanwhile the crew tries to get back home. They even pass the moon. In the end, they come back landing at Houston. Everybody's fine (until the movie loses the academy award to Braveheart) I'd say Apollo 13 is a good space movie to watch during a Taco Night. YAY!!!!!!!

    I liked this movie. It was an okay watch, and it had some suspenseful moments. However, it was just too slow. Almost the entire two hours of the movie seemed to take place in the ship, or mission control. Obviously they couldn't do much more than that, since it is a true story, but I felt it was too long for what it was. Some movies, such as "The Breakfast Club" manage to pull off a fantastic movie in only one or two areas for the entire film. Overall, it was a pretty good watch, and it's definitely a classic, but the movie probably would have done better without dragging on so long, and probably should have been shortened by about half an hour.

    This is clearly one of my favorite movies in recent years. Even though some dramatic license is taken, it's still better than The Right Stuff, which it's often compared to. This film is taken from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon, rather than a fiction book like Tom Wolfe's It also portrays the characters with more respect than that film, although Jack Sweigert was NOT a "rookie" by any means, and Ken Mattingly didn't solve the CM restart by himself (but it is mentioned that Ken was representing all those who did help out with this. This is a movie I would see over and over again. Even Gene Kranz liked the line "Failure is not an option," though he never said it. That's saying something! Kudos to Ron Howard.

    By-the-numbers B.S. about the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon flight. Tom (Shoots) Blanks was cast as Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. Hanks' squirrelly voice will grate on you for over 2 hours if you last that long before you: 1. Fall asleep on the couch, 2. Realize you could have more fun cleaning out the bird cage, or 3. Use the DVD as a Frisbee by heaving it into the field down the street. The director (and I use that term loosely) Ron "Opie" Howard once again exhibits his own personal patented tripe which he tries to pass off as directorial abilities. All the predictable special effects clich&eacute;s, including a plethora or historical inaccuracies, fester on the screen, and it's all Dopey Opie's fault. Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton are about the worst actors Howard could have chosen for this dishonest garbage. From the filthy sex jokes early in the movie to having two of the astronauts point fingers at one another concerning the cause of the disaster, this flick isn't good enough for the birds, which is totally logical since the film just doesn't fly. If you want to see the TRUE story of what happened to Apollo 13, go to Youtube and watch the NASA film 'Houston, We've Got A Problem'. That film is well-produced, has much better direction, and is infinitely more interesting than the Failure Club of Howard, Hanks, and the other idiots found here. Rating: 0 stars out a possible 10. Poor Dopey Opie. May he get run over by a locomotive at 9:30 tonight.

    Apollo 13 **** (out of 4) 136 mins / PG Cast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe Spano Director: Ron Howard Plot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines "Houston, we have a problem", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

    I believe Jim Lovell made a cameo at the end of the movie Apollo 13. The shot of him is very brief. Once the capsule has landed in the water and the crew is then is hauled up to the waiting helicopter. The helicopter then lands upon the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima. The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot. Next time you watch the movie give it a glance and see what you think. I researched the real Apollo13 and photos of the actual astronauts.Thats how I came about to recognize who I think is Lovell in the movie.

    I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how "right" they "got it". I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to "modernize" styles, not trusting the audience to "get it", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deepjust dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood. Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them. A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a "story" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives. The acting was good, but the writing was often clich&eacute;d. A lot of it reminded me of things like "Back To Bataan" or the "Sands of Iwo Jima", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing "A" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting. A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to bemainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.) But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.
