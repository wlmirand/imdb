 <storyline>
  Set in urban Auckland (New Zealand) this movie tells the story of the Heke family. Jake Heke is a violent man who beats his wife frequently when drunk, and yet obviously loves both her and his family. The movie follows a period of several weeks in the family's life showing Jake's frequent outburst of violence and the effect that this has on his family. The youngest son is in trouble with the police and may be put into a foster home while the elder son is about to join a street gang. Jake's daughter has her own serious problems which are a key element in the plot.

    This movie was an epic experience. I have never experienced a movie with such insight to Maori culture in the 90's. Temeura Morrison's performance was spot on and who could forget Rena Owen. The storyline was superb and kept the audience engaged every second of the movie. One drawback is the outcome was rather predictable but still I was engaged. The insight to Maori culture was phenomenal however. Being a person of Poly decent I was drawn into the movie through cultural aspects and i enjoyed every minute of it. Nothing compares in my book. Great job to the director and it will be a classic in my eyes. All in all, great movie experience.

    I saw this film when i was about 14 it was on t.v. And i was blown away it was amazing. It is in my top 10 of all time without a doubt. From beginning to end it is so powerful its unreal. the whole cast were fantastic. Temuera Morrison was just awesome he had to change his personality from scene to scene and the violence he had to portray through out just amazing. The stuff that is in this film must have been hard on all of them it was so gritty and dark and disturbing in a lot of ways but the whole storyline required it for the film to work and it did. the violence in the film so good looked so real rena owen also a great performance for what she had to deal with throughout.The emotional drain on the actors/actress's must have been hard more so in the death scene and the scene where rena finds out why grace killed herself is just so strong and powerful. I have watched this film a lot and i will never get bored of it and its still as strong as the 1st time i watched it. If you haven't seen this before WATCH IT.

    This film blew me away. The acting was absolutely perfect; each character seemed so real, that at times it was easy to get very caught up in the story. The story, though painful, is very moving. I don't think I've ever watched another movie that has made me cry so much. But is this bad? Not at all. If you plan on watching this, be careful: it can be triggering, and I'd recommend not watching it all in one night (I watched it in two). It can be very draining. I felt quite sad after I watched it. Not many people have mentioned the great music. The guitar throughout the movie is very nice, suits the film well. Highly recommended!

    Who do a warrior people war with when all the wars are vanquished? And the answer is in this instance; themselves. This is a depiction of The Maori peoples of New Zealand, a world in which masculine ferocity reigns supreme amongst social degradation, and those that are fragile and soulful are so often the heartbreaking collateral. This is searingly powerful stuff; with no excess stylisation in order in bring its message home, just fantastic performances and solid, no holds barred filmmaking. I can think of few films from any country in which domestic violence is so accurately portrayed, Temuera Morrison's startling realistic portrayal of a Jake The Muss, an incredibly violent and unpleasant father after all drew the attention of George Lucas (shame about the outcome, and yeah that's me kicking 'the sci-fi holy grail' in the balls.). Rena Owen as his beyond brave wife Beth, also demands much praise for her performance (haven't seen her in much since the little known sequel, and yes I could bring up a number of points about both ethnicity and gender.). Like all the great films 'Once Were Warriors' confronts a truth of matters that so often are so often hidden away and treated as social taboo's. In fact while the film very much remains a powerful depiction of The Maori peoples its themes transcend race or even necessarily class background. And in a world of crap, truth matters the most. It shimmers like gold.

    The chances are a majority of us have never heard of ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Those who have come across this movie will always be able to recall this movie ages down the line. The powerful message of domestic violence and the struggle for survival is something once watched in ONCE WERE WARRIORS cannot be forgotten. I was told of this movie quite by chance whilst in conversation of the "greatest movies of the 90s". Curiosity always gets the best of me and I am grateful I was able to find a copy of this title. The relevance of the message discussed in ONCE WERE WARRIORS to me seems more appropriate today than it would have been almost 2 decades ago. The significance of the Maori tribe is irrelevant in the discussion of its message. Director Lee Tamahoris' intention of portraying the powerful Maori descendants is in no way an indication that the theme discusses the Maori way of life. Instead it speaks of the way of life of the poor in the world. In a time where natural disasters are at a record high, man-made weapons of mass destruction have the potential of destroying all earthly life and at a time where poverty is increasing more rapidly than it can be fought; this theme could not be more appropriate. Set in an unnamed city in Southern Auckland, New Zealand, Beth Heke (Rena Owen) and her family struggle to meet their basic necessities. Beth who looks after her 5 children along with her husband Jake lives an ordinary life. Ordinary has a very peculiar subtext in ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Ordinary in the MƒÅorian way of life is a hard day's work, a couple of beers that follow with the whole community carrying the drinking to one particular house until the drinking can go on no more. To some of us viewers this life may seem wrong, however I personally feel it's beautiful to see how people manage to smile through all the hardships of life even with the help of alcohol. The only unbalanced medium in this fine equation of poverty and happiness is the temper that Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) carries along with him. Jake loves his family dearly; however under the influence of alcohol he is an uncontrollable monster that is yearning to be released. Jake has very little tolerance and respect to those around him once he is provoked. May it be wife, child or friend Jake would not hesitate to throw his arms around! He packs a punch meaner than Jason Statham of today! The success in ONCE WERE WARRIORS is most certainly her talented cast. Rena Owen puts up a performance that I personally will remember a life time. An actress who has been called one of the most talented actress of her time indeed is worthy of such praise. None will say otherwise once you have seen her in this. The most touching moment is when Rena Owens holds her deceased daughter in her arms in her own back yard; I broke down into tears when I felt her pain. The mix is perfect with Temuera Morrison who stars by Owens side. How these two performances were not acknowledged at the Oscars during its time is question I could not find an answer to. With over 19 awards to its name ONCE WERE WARRIORS is certainly amongst the top 50 movies of the 90s! TITLE: ONCE WERE WARRIORS DIRECTED BY: LEE TAMAHORI STARRING: RENA OWEN, TEMUERA MORRISON AND MAMAENGAROA RATED: R FOR PERVASIVE LANGUAGE AND STRONG DEPECTION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE RATING: 08/10 102 MINUTES

    Once were warriors" 1994 by LeeTamahori is one of the most powerful films I've seen. Violence seems to play a major role throughout the movie; however, I think violence come from a lack of education and low social communication skills. Jake always gets in a fight when he drinks, but that's the way Jake explains his emotion and also he is struggling to fit the society. The last scene, when Grace commit suicide, that was so sad but I think Grace didn't just gave up her life, she wanted to change her family and she saved her family.

    This controversial movie is about a young girl who is trying to make the best of her situation at home, but at the end fails to be happy due to the environment around her. It surprised me when the dad seemed to be a nice guy in the beginning then as soon as he touched alcohol, he turned in a raging bull. It sickened me to see the horrid realities that was happening around this family. The drinking, daily beatings, sexual harassments, all of which happened around the atmosphere of the children. Jake's incontrollable temper leads him to live a life tormenting his family. What i didn't understand was if he was making their lives so horrible why not leave that much sooner? Did the death of Grace have to be the push she needed to know that the environment the children were living in was not safe? Overall this movie moved me and kept me at the edge of my seat especially when sweet Grace turned sour, with all reasons deserved, on her family.

    This film is about a dysfunctional minority family in New Zealand. Beth, the protagonist defies her parents wishes by marrying Jake. In the beginning Jake seems to be a bit rowdy but an OK guy. Later you get to see the real Jake after Beth refuses to do something for him. In this film you witness the breakdown of this family. Nig, one of Beth's sons joins a gang for support. Boogie, Beth's youngest son is removed by child services because he's considered uncontrollable. This leaves Beth and her two daughters to deal with the abusive Jake. This film was very good but hard to watch at times. The violence was brutally realistic and not over the top which made it effects you even more.

    "Once Were Warriors" was a pretty good film. its starts out with a cool laid back family, but then then the family just gets ripped apart. Very violent film in my opinion, it kind of reminds me of a graphic comic book for adults. the film deals with real crazy issues with a family and takes it to a whole another level. The movie reminds me of "the Warriors" just on there style and it's different approach to making a movie. The music that is being played in the film has a type of reggae rock type feel. It goes perfect with this film because reggae has that laid back feel when you are listing to it and the rock music gives the movie some energy and some power.

    What an intense film! The violence that is contained in this project is not gratuitous, rather it is visceral and real to life. I noted that song, language, story and other aspects of culture are ways of combating ongoing colonization of the soul. The character arcs are truly remarkable, and I like the fact the even the villainous characters have some sympathetic traits to them. The sound track is amazing, a Maori-Reggae hybrid that truly rocks. The ending wraps things up in a hopeful message that overcomes tragedies. This film is so specific to the Maori plight post-colonization that it is a universally relevant film. Go and see for yourself!

    This film blew me away. The acting was absolutely perfect; each character seemed so real, that at times it was easy to get very caught up in the story. The story, though painful, is very moving. I don't think I've ever watched another movie that has made me cry so much. But is this bad? Not at all. If you plan on watching this, be careful: it can be triggering, and I'd recommend not watching it all in one night (I watched it in two). It can be very draining. I felt quite sad after I watched it. Not many people have mentioned the great music. The guitar throughout the movie is very nice, suits the film well. Highly recommended!

    Who do a warrior people war with when all the wars are vanquished? And the answer is in this instance; themselves. This is a depiction of The Maori peoples of New Zealand, a world in which masculine ferocity reigns supreme amongst social degradation, and those that are fragile and soulful are so often the heartbreaking collateral. This is searingly powerful stuff; with no excess stylisation in order in bring its message home, just fantastic performances and solid, no holds barred filmmaking. I can think of few films from any country in which domestic violence is so accurately portrayed, Temuera Morrison's startling realistic portrayal of a Jake The Muss, an incredibly violent and unpleasant father after all drew the attention of George Lucas (shame about the outcome, and yeah that's me kicking 'the sci-fi holy grail' in the balls.). Rena Owen as his beyond brave wife Beth, also demands much praise for her performance (haven't seen her in much since the little known sequel, and yes I could bring up a number of points about both ethnicity and gender.). Like all the great films 'Once Were Warriors' confronts a truth of matters that so often are so often hidden away and treated as social taboo's. In fact while the film very much remains a powerful depiction of The Maori peoples its themes transcend race or even necessarily class background. And in a world of crap, truth matters the most. It shimmers like gold.

    The chances are a majority of us have never heard of ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Those who have come across this movie will always be able to recall this movie ages down the line. The powerful message of domestic violence and the struggle for survival is something once watched in ONCE WERE WARRIORS cannot be forgotten. I was told of this movie quite by chance whilst in conversation of the "greatest movies of the 90s". Curiosity always gets the best of me and I am grateful I was able to find a copy of this title. The relevance of the message discussed in ONCE WERE WARRIORS to me seems more appropriate today than it would have been almost 2 decades ago. The significance of the Maori tribe is irrelevant in the discussion of its message. Director Lee Tamahoris' intention of portraying the powerful Maori descendants is in no way an indication that the theme discusses the Maori way of life. Instead it speaks of the way of life of the poor in the world. In a time where natural disasters are at a record high, man-made weapons of mass destruction have the potential of destroying all earthly life and at a time where poverty is increasing more rapidly than it can be fought; this theme could not be more appropriate. Set in an unnamed city in Southern Auckland, New Zealand, Beth Heke (Rena Owen) and her family struggle to meet their basic necessities. Beth who looks after her 5 children along with her husband Jake lives an ordinary life. Ordinary has a very peculiar subtext in ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Ordinary in the MƒÅorian way of life is a hard day's work, a couple of beers that follow with the whole community carrying the drinking to one particular house until the drinking can go on no more. To some of us viewers this life may seem wrong, however I personally feel it's beautiful to see how people manage to smile through all the hardships of life even with the help of alcohol. The only unbalanced medium in this fine equation of poverty and happiness is the temper that Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) carries along with him. Jake loves his family dearly; however under the influence of alcohol he is an uncontrollable monster that is yearning to be released. Jake has very little tolerance and respect to those around him once he is provoked. May it be wife, child or friend Jake would not hesitate to throw his arms around! He packs a punch meaner than Jason Statham of today! The success in ONCE WERE WARRIORS is most certainly her talented cast. Rena Owen puts up a performance that I personally will remember a life time. An actress who has been called one of the most talented actress of her time indeed is worthy of such praise. None will say otherwise once you have seen her in this. The most touching moment is when Rena Owens holds her deceased daughter in her arms in her own back yard; I broke down into tears when I felt her pain. The mix is perfect with Temuera Morrison who stars by Owens side. How these two performances were not acknowledged at the Oscars during its time is question I could not find an answer to. With over 19 awards to its name ONCE WERE WARRIORS is certainly amongst the top 50 movies of the 90s! TITLE: ONCE WERE WARRIORS DIRECTED BY: LEE TAMAHORI STARRING: RENA OWEN, TEMUERA MORRISON AND MAMAENGAROA RATED: R FOR PERVASIVE LANGUAGE AND STRONG DEPECTION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE RATING: 08/10 102 MINUTES

    Once were warriors" 1994 by LeeTamahori is one of the most powerful films I've seen. Violence seems to play a major role throughout the movie; however, I think violence come from a lack of education and low social communication skills. Jake always gets in a fight when he drinks, but that's the way Jake explains his emotion and also he is struggling to fit the society. The last scene, when Grace commit suicide, that was so sad but I think Grace didn't just gave up her life, she wanted to change her family and she saved her family.

    This controversial movie is about a young girl who is trying to make the best of her situation at home, but at the end fails to be happy due to the environment around her. It surprised me when the dad seemed to be a nice guy in the beginning then as soon as he touched alcohol, he turned in a raging bull. It sickened me to see the horrid realities that was happening around this family. The drinking, daily beatings, sexual harassments, all of which happened around the atmosphere of the children. Jake's incontrollable temper leads him to live a life tormenting his family. What i didn't understand was if he was making their lives so horrible why not leave that much sooner? Did the death of Grace have to be the push she needed to know that the environment the children were living in was not safe? Overall this movie moved me and kept me at the edge of my seat especially when sweet Grace turned sour, with all reasons deserved, on her family.

    This film is about a dysfunctional minority family in New Zealand. Beth, the protagonist defies her parents wishes by marrying Jake. In the beginning Jake seems to be a bit rowdy but an OK guy. Later you get to see the real Jake after Beth refuses to do something for him. In this film you witness the breakdown of this family. Nig, one of Beth's sons joins a gang for support. Boogie, Beth's youngest son is removed by child services because he's considered uncontrollable. This leaves Beth and her two daughters to deal with the abusive Jake. This film was very good but hard to watch at times. The violence was brutally realistic and not over the top which made it effects you even more.

    "Once Were Warriors" was a pretty good film. its starts out with a cool laid back family, but then then the family just gets ripped apart. Very violent film in my opinion, it kind of reminds me of a graphic comic book for adults. the film deals with real crazy issues with a family and takes it to a whole another level. The movie reminds me of "the Warriors" just on there style and it's different approach to making a movie. The music that is being played in the film has a type of reggae rock type feel. It goes perfect with this film because reggae has that laid back feel when you are listing to it and the rock music gives the movie some energy and some power.

    What an intense film! The violence that is contained in this project is not gratuitous, rather it is visceral and real to life. I noted that song, language, story and other aspects of culture are ways of combating ongoing colonization of the soul. The character arcs are truly remarkable, and I like the fact the even the villainous characters have some sympathetic traits to them. The sound track is amazing, a Maori-Reggae hybrid that truly rocks. The ending wraps things up in a hopeful message that overcomes tragedies. This film is so specific to the Maori plight post-colonization that it is a universally relevant film. Go and see for yourself!

    This movie was an epic experience. I have never experienced a movie with such insight to Maori culture in the 90's. Temeura Morrison's performance was spot on and who could forget Rena Owen. The storyline was superb and kept the audience engaged every second of the movie. One drawback is the outcome was rather predictable but still I was engaged. The insight to Maori culture was phenomenal however. Being a person of Poly decent I was drawn into the movie through cultural aspects and i enjoyed every minute of it. Nothing compares in my book. Great job to the director and it will be a classic in my eyes. All in all, great movie experience.

    I saw this film when i was about 14 it was on t.v. And i was blown away it was amazing. It is in my top 10 of all time without a doubt. From beginning to end it is so powerful its unreal. the whole cast were fantastic. Temuera Morrison was just awesome he had to change his personality from scene to scene and the violence he had to portray through out just amazing. The stuff that is in this film must have been hard on all of them it was so gritty and dark and disturbing in a lot of ways but the whole storyline required it for the film to work and it did. the violence in the film so good looked so real rena owen also a great performance for what she had to deal with throughout.The emotional drain on the actors/actress's must have been hard more so in the death scene and the scene where rena finds out why grace killed herself is just so strong and powerful. I have watched this film a lot and i will never get bored of it and its still as strong as the 1st time i watched it. If you haven't seen this before WATCH IT.

Jake has very little tolerance and respect to those around him once he is provoked. May it be wife, child or friend Jake would not hesitate to throw his arms around! He packs a punch meaner than Jason Statham of today! The success in ONCE WERE WARRIORS is most certainly her talented cast. Rena Owen puts up a performance that I personally will remember a life time. An actress who has been called one of the most talented actress of her time indeed is worthy of such praise. None will say otherwise once you have seen her in this. The most touching moment is when Rena Owens holds her deceased daughter in her arms in her own back yard; I broke down into tears when I felt her pain. The mix is perfect with Temuera Morrison who stars by Owens side. How these two performances were not acknowledged at the Oscars during its time is question I could not find an answer to. With over 19 awards to its name ONCE WERE WARRIORS is certainly amongst the top 50 movies of the 90s! TITLE: ONCE WERE WARRIORS DIRECTED BY: LEE TAMAHORI STARRING: RENA OWEN, TEMUERA MORRISON AND MAMAENGAROA RATED: R FOR PERVASIVE LANGUAGE AND STRONG DEPECTION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE RATING: 08/10 102 MINUTES

    Once were warriors" 1994 by LeeTamahori is one of the most powerful films I've seen. Violence seems to play a major role throughout the movie; however, I think violence come from a lack of education and low social communication skills. Jake always gets in a fight when he drinks, but that's the way Jake explains his emotion and also he is struggling to fit the society. The last scene, when Grace commit suicide, that was so sad but I think Grace didn't just gave up her life, she wanted to change her family and she saved her family.

    This controversial movie is about a young girl who is trying to make the best of her situation at home, but at the end fails to be happy due to the environment around her. It surprised me when the dad seemed to be a nice guy in the beginning then as soon as he touched alcohol, he turned in a raging bull. It sickened me to see the horrid realities that was happening around this family. The drinking, daily beatings, sexual harassments, all of which happened around the atmosphere of the children. Jake's incontrollable temper leads him to live a life tormenting his family. What i didn't understand was if he was making their lives so horrible why not leave that much sooner? Did the death of Grace have to be the push she needed to know that the environment the children were living in was not safe? Overall this movie moved me and kept me at the edge of my seat especially when sweet Grace turned sour, with all reasons deserved, on her family.

    This film is about a dysfunctional minority family in New Zealand. Beth, the protagonist defies her parents wishes by marrying Jake. In the beginning Jake seems to be a bit rowdy but an OK guy. Later you get to see the real Jake after Beth refuses to do something for him. In this film you witness the breakdown of this family. Nig, one of Beth's sons joins a gang for support. Boogie, Beth's youngest son is removed by child services because he's considered uncontrollable. This leaves Beth and her two daughters to deal with the abusive Jake. This film was very good but hard to watch at times. The violence was brutally realistic and not over the top which made it effects you even more.

    "Once Were Warriors" was a pretty good film. its starts out with a cool laid back family, but then then the family just gets ripped apart. Very violent film in my opinion, it kind of reminds me of a graphic comic book for adults. the film deals with real crazy issues with a family and takes it to a whole another level. The movie reminds me of "the Warriors" just on there style and it's different approach to making a movie. The music that is being played in the film has a type of reggae rock type feel. It goes perfect with this film because reggae has that laid back feel when you are listing to it and the rock music gives the movie some energy and some power.

    What an intense film! The violence that is contained in this project is not gratuitous, rather it is visceral and real to life. I noted that song, language, story and other aspects of culture are ways of combating ongoing colonization of the soul. The character arcs are truly remarkable, and I like the fact the even the villainous characters have some sympathetic traits to them. The sound track is amazing, a Maori-Reggae hybrid that truly rocks. The ending wraps things up in a hopeful message that overcomes tragedies. This film is so specific to the Maori plight post-colonization that it is a universally relevant film. Go and see for yourself!

    This movie was an epic experience. I have never experienced a movie with such insight to Maori culture in the 90's. Temeura Morrison's performance was spot on and who could forget Rena Owen. The storyline was superb and kept the audience engaged every second of the movie. One drawback is the outcome was rather predictable but still I was engaged. The insight to Maori culture was phenomenal however. Being a person of Poly decent I was drawn into the movie through cultural aspects and i enjoyed every minute of it. Nothing compares in my book. Great job to the director and it will be a classic in my eyes. All in all, great movie experience.

    I saw this film when i was about 14 it was on t.v. And i was blown away it was amazing. It is in my top 10 of all time without a doubt. From beginning to end it is so powerful its unreal. the whole cast were fantastic. Temuera Morrison was just awesome he had to change his personality from scene to scene and the violence he had to portray through out just amazing. The stuff that is in this film must have been hard on all of them it was so gritty and dark and disturbing in a lot of ways but the whole storyline required it for the film to work and it did. the violence in the film so good looked so real rena owen also a great performance for what she had to deal with throughout.The emotional drain on the actors/actress's must have been hard more so in the death scene and the scene where rena finds out why grace killed herself is just so strong and powerful. I have watched this film a lot and i will never get bored of it and its still as strong as the 1st time i watched it. If you haven't seen this before WATCH IT.

    This film blew me away. The acting was absolutely perfect; each character seemed so real, that at times it was easy to get very caught up in the story. The story, though painful, is very moving. I don't think I've ever watched another movie that has made me cry so much. But is this bad? Not at all. If you plan on watching this, be careful: it can be triggering, and I'd recommend not watching it all in one night (I watched it in two). It can be very draining. I felt quite sad after I watched it. Not many people have mentioned the great music. The guitar throughout the movie is very nice, suits the film well. Highly recommended!

    Who do a warrior people war with when all the wars are vanquished? And the answer is in this instance; themselves. This is a depiction of The Maori peoples of New Zealand, a world in which masculine ferocity reigns supreme amongst social degradation, and those that are fragile and soulful are so often the heartbreaking collateral. This is searingly powerful stuff; with no excess stylisation in order in bring its message home, just fantastic performances and solid, no holds barred filmmaking. I can think of few films from any country in which domestic violence is so accurately portrayed, Temuera Morrison's startling realistic portrayal of a Jake The Muss, an incredibly violent and unpleasant father after all drew the attention of George Lucas (shame about the outcome, and yeah that's me kicking 'the sci-fi holy grail' in the balls.). Rena Owen as his beyond brave wife Beth, also demands much praise for her performance (haven't seen her in much since the little known sequel, and yes I could bring up a number of points about both ethnicity and gender.). Like all the great films 'Once Were Warriors' confronts a truth of matters that so often are so often hidden away and treated as social taboo's. In fact while the film very much remains a powerful depiction of The Maori peoples its themes transcend race or even necessarily class background. And in a world of crap, truth matters the most. It shimmers like gold.

    The chances are a majority of us have never heard of ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Those who have come across this movie will always be able to recall this movie ages down the line. The powerful message of domestic violence and the struggle for survival is something once watched in ONCE WERE WARRIORS cannot be forgotten. I was told of this movie quite by chance whilst in conversation of the "greatest movies of the 90s". Curiosity always gets the best of me and I am grateful I was able to find a copy of this title. The relevance of the message discussed in ONCE WERE WARRIORS to me seems more appropriate today than it would have been almost 2 decades ago. The significance of the Maori tribe is irrelevant in the discussion of its message. Director Lee Tamahoris' intention of portraying the powerful Maori descendants is in no way an indication that the theme discusses the Maori way of life. Instead it speaks of the way of life of the poor in the world. In a time where natural disasters are at a record high, man-made weapons of mass destruction have the potential of destroying all earthly life and at a time where poverty is increasing more rapidly than it can be fought; this theme could not be more appropriate. Set in an unnamed city in Southern Auckland, New Zealand, Beth Heke (Rena Owen) and her family struggle to meet their basic necessities. Beth who looks after her 5 children along with her husband Jake lives an ordinary life. Ordinary has a very peculiar subtext in ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Ordinary in the MƒÅorian way of life is a hard day's work, a couple of beers that follow with the whole community carrying the drinking to one particular house until the drinking can go on no more. To some of us viewers this life may seem wrong, however I personally feel it's beautiful to see how people manage to smile through all the hardships of life even with the help of alcohol. The only unbalanced medium in this fine equation of poverty and happiness is the temper that Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) carries along with him. Jake loves his family dearly; however under the influence of alcohol he is an uncontrollable monster that is yearning to be released. Jake has very little tolerance and respect to those around him once he is provoked. May it be wife, child or friend Jake would not hesitate to throw his arms around! He packs a punch meaner than Jason Statham of today! The success in ONCE WERE WARRIORS is most certainly her talented cast.

    "Once Were Warriors" was a pretty good film. its starts out with a cool laid back family, but then then the family just gets ripped apart. Very violent film in my opinion, it kind of reminds me of a graphic comic book for adults. the film deals with real crazy issues with a family and takes it to a whole another level. The movie reminds me of "the Warriors" just on there style and it's different approach to making a movie. The music that is being played in the film has a type of reggae rock type feel. It goes perfect with this film because reggae has that laid back feel when you are listing to it and the rock music gives the movie some energy and some power.

    What an intense film! The violence that is contained in this project is not gratuitous, rather it is visceral and real to life. I noted that song, language, story and other aspects of culture are ways of combating ongoing colonization of the soul. The character arcs are truly remarkable, and I like the fact the even the villainous characters have some sympathetic traits to them. The sound track is amazing, a Maori-Reggae hybrid that truly rocks. The ending wraps things up in a hopeful message that overcomes tragedies. This film is so specific to the Maori plight post-colonization that it is a universally relevant film. Go and see for yourself!

    This movie was an epic experience. I have never experienced a movie with such insight to Maori culture in the 90's. Temeura Morrison's performance was spot on and who could forget Rena Owen. The storyline was superb and kept the audience engaged every second of the movie. One drawback is the outcome was rather predictable but still I was engaged. The insight to Maori culture was phenomenal however. Being a person of Poly decent I was drawn into the movie through cultural aspects and i enjoyed every minute of it. Nothing compares in my book. Great job to the director and it will be a classic in my eyes. All in all, great movie experience.

    I saw this film when i was about 14 it was on t.v. And i was blown away it was amazing. It is in my top 10 of all time without a doubt. From beginning to end it is so powerful its unreal. the whole cast were fantastic. Temuera Morrison was just awesome he had to change his personality from scene to scene and the violence he had to portray through out just amazing. The stuff that is in this film must have been hard on all of them it was so gritty and dark and disturbing in a lot of ways but the whole storyline required it for the film to work and it did. the violence in the film so good looked so real rena owen also a great performance for what she had to deal with throughout.The emotional drain on the actors/actress's must have been hard more so in the death scene and the scene where rena finds out why grace killed herself is just so strong and powerful. I have watched this film a lot and i will never get bored of it and its still as strong as the 1st time i watched it. If you haven't seen this before WATCH IT.

    This film blew me away. The acting was absolutely perfect; each character seemed so real, that at times it was easy to get very caught up in the story. The story, though painful, is very moving. I don't think I've ever watched another movie that has made me cry so much. But is this bad? Not at all. If you plan on watching this, be careful: it can be triggering, and I'd recommend not watching it all in one night (I watched it in two). It can be very draining. I felt quite sad after I watched it. Not many people have mentioned the great music. The guitar throughout the movie is very nice, suits the film well. Highly recommended!

    Who do a warrior people war with when all the wars are vanquished? And the answer is in this instance; themselves. This is a depiction of The Maori peoples of New Zealand, a world in which masculine ferocity reigns supreme amongst social degradation, and those that are fragile and soulful are so often the heartbreaking collateral. This is searingly powerful stuff; with no excess stylisation in order in bring its message home, just fantastic performances and solid, no holds barred filmmaking. I can think of few films from any country in which domestic violence is so accurately portrayed, Temuera Morrison's startling realistic portrayal of a Jake The Muss, an incredibly violent and unpleasant father after all drew the attention of George Lucas (shame about the outcome, and yeah that's me kicking 'the sci-fi holy grail' in the balls.). Rena Owen as his beyond brave wife Beth, also demands much praise for her performance (haven't seen her in much since the little known sequel, and yes I could bring up a number of points about both ethnicity and gender.). Like all the great films 'Once Were Warriors' confronts a truth of matters that so often are so often hidden away and treated as social taboo's. In fact while the film very much remains a powerful depiction of The Maori peoples its themes transcend race or even necessarily class background. And in a world of crap, truth matters the most. It shimmers like gold.

    The chances are a majority of us have never heard of ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Those who have come across this movie will always be able to recall this movie ages down the line. The powerful message of domestic violence and the struggle for survival is something once watched in ONCE WERE WARRIORS cannot be forgotten. I was told of this movie quite by chance whilst in conversation of the "greatest movies of the 90s". Curiosity always gets the best of me and I am grateful I was able to find a copy of this title. The relevance of the message discussed in ONCE WERE WARRIORS to me seems more appropriate today than it would have been almost 2 decades ago. The significance of the Maori tribe is irrelevant in the discussion of its message. Director Lee Tamahoris' intention of portraying the powerful Maori descendants is in no way an indication that the theme discusses the Maori way of life. Instead it speaks of the way of life of the poor in the world. In a time where natural disasters are at a record high, man-made weapons of mass destruction have the potential of destroying all earthly life and at a time where poverty is increasing more rapidly than it can be fought; this theme could not be more appropriate. Set in an unnamed city in Southern Auckland, New Zealand, Beth Heke (Rena Owen) and her family struggle to meet their basic necessities. Beth who looks after her 5 children along with her husband Jake lives an ordinary life. Ordinary has a very peculiar subtext in ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Ordinary in the MƒÅorian way of life is a hard day's work, a couple of beers that follow with the whole community carrying the drinking to one particular house until the drinking can go on no more. To some of us viewers this life may seem wrong, however I personally feel it's beautiful to see how people manage to smile through all the hardships of life even with the help of alcohol. The only unbalanced medium in this fine equation of poverty and happiness is the temper that Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) carries along with him. Jake loves his family dearly; however under the influence of alcohol he is an uncontrollable monster that is yearning to be released. Jake has very little tolerance and respect to those around him once he is provoked. May it be wife, child or friend Jake would not hesitate to throw his arms around! He packs a punch meaner than Jason Statham of today! The success in ONCE WERE WARRIORS is most certainly her talented cast. Rena Owen puts up a performance that I personally will remember a life time. An actress who has been called one of the most talented actress of her time indeed is worthy of such praise. None will say otherwise once you have seen her in this. The most touching moment is when Rena Owens holds her deceased daughter in her arms in her own back yard; I broke down into tears when I felt her pain. The mix is perfect with Temuera Morrison who stars by Owens side. How these two performances were not acknowledged at the Oscars during its time is question I could not find an answer to. With over 19 awards to its name ONCE WERE WARRIORS is certainly amongst the top 50 movies of the 90s! TITLE: ONCE WERE WARRIORS DIRECTED BY: LEE TAMAHORI STARRING: RENA OWEN, TEMUERA MORRISON AND MAMAENGAROA RATED: R FOR PERVASIVE LANGUAGE AND STRONG DEPECTION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE RATING: 08/10 102 MINUTES

    Once were warriors" 1994 by LeeTamahori is one of the most powerful films I've seen. Violence seems to play a major role throughout the movie; however, I think violence come from a lack of education and low social communication skills. Jake always gets in a fight when he drinks, but that's the way Jake explains his emotion and also he is struggling to fit the society. The last scene, when Grace commit suicide, that was so sad but I think Grace didn't just gave up her life, she wanted to change her family and she saved her family.

    This controversial movie is about a young girl who is trying to make the best of her situation at home, but at the end fails to be happy due to the environment around her. It surprised me when the dad seemed to be a nice guy in the beginning then as soon as he touched alcohol, he turned in a raging bull. It sickened me to see the horrid realities that was happening around this family. The drinking, daily beatings, sexual harassments, all of which happened around the atmosphere of the children. Jake's incontrollable temper leads him to live a life tormenting his family. What i didn't understand was if he was making their lives so horrible why not leave that much sooner? Did the death of Grace have to be the push she needed to know that the environment the children were living in was not safe? Overall this movie moved me and kept me at the edge of my seat especially when sweet Grace turned sour, with all reasons deserved, on her family.

    This film is about a dysfunctional minority family in New Zealand. Beth, the protagonist defies her parents wishes by marrying Jake. In the beginning Jake seems to be a bit rowdy but an OK guy. Later you get to see the real Jake after Beth refuses to do something for him. In this film you witness the breakdown of this family. Nig, one of Beth's sons joins a gang for support. Boogie, Beth's youngest son is removed by child services because he's considered uncontrollable. This leaves Beth and her two daughters to deal with the abusive Jake. This film was very good but hard to watch at times. The violence was brutally realistic and not over the top which made it effects you even more.

I don't think I've ever watched another movie that has made me cry so much. But is this bad? Not at all. If you plan on watching this, be careful: it can be triggering, and I'd recommend not watching it all in one night (I watched it in two). It can be very draining. I felt quite sad after I watched it. Not many people have mentioned the great music. The guitar throughout the movie is very nice, suits the film well. Highly recommended!

    Who do a warrior people war with when all the wars are vanquished? And the answer is in this instance; themselves. This is a depiction of The Maori peoples of New Zealand, a world in which masculine ferocity reigns supreme amongst social degradation, and those that are fragile and soulful are so often the heartbreaking collateral. This is searingly powerful stuff; with no excess stylisation in order in bring its message home, just fantastic performances and solid, no holds barred filmmaking. I can think of few films from any country in which domestic violence is so accurately portrayed, Temuera Morrison's startling realistic portrayal of a Jake The Muss, an incredibly violent and unpleasant father after all drew the attention of George Lucas (shame about the outcome, and yeah that's me kicking 'the sci-fi holy grail' in the balls.). Rena Owen as his beyond brave wife Beth, also demands much praise for her performance (haven't seen her in much since the little known sequel, and yes I could bring up a number of points about both ethnicity and gender.). Like all the great films 'Once Were Warriors' confronts a truth of matters that so often are so often hidden away and treated as social taboo's. In fact while the film very much remains a powerful depiction of The Maori peoples its themes transcend race or even necessarily class background. And in a world of crap, truth matters the most. It shimmers like gold.

    The chances are a majority of us have never heard of ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Those who have come across this movie will always be able to recall this movie ages down the line. The powerful message of domestic violence and the struggle for survival is something once watched in ONCE WERE WARRIORS cannot be forgotten. I was told of this movie quite by chance whilst in conversation of the "greatest movies of the 90s". Curiosity always gets the best of me and I am grateful I was able to find a copy of this title. The relevance of the message discussed in ONCE WERE WARRIORS to me seems more appropriate today than it would have been almost 2 decades ago. The significance of the Maori tribe is irrelevant in the discussion of its message. Director Lee Tamahoris' intention of portraying the powerful Maori descendants is in no way an indication that the theme discusses the Maori way of life. Instead it speaks of the way of life of the poor in the world. In a time where natural disasters are at a record high, man-made weapons of mass destruction have the potential of destroying all earthly life and at a time where poverty is increasing more rapidly than it can be fought; this theme could not be more appropriate. Set in an unnamed city in Southern Auckland, New Zealand, Beth Heke (Rena Owen) and her family struggle to meet their basic necessities. Beth who looks after her 5 children along with her husband Jake lives an ordinary life. Ordinary has a very peculiar subtext in ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Ordinary in the MƒÅorian way of life is a hard day's work, a couple of beers that follow with the whole community carrying the drinking to one particular house until the drinking can go on no more. To some of us viewers this life may seem wrong, however I personally feel it's beautiful to see how people manage to smile through all the hardships of life even with the help of alcohol. The only unbalanced medium in this fine equation of poverty and happiness is the temper that Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) carries along with him. Jake loves his family dearly; however under the influence of alcohol he is an uncontrollable monster that is yearning to be released. Jake has very little tolerance and respect to those around him once he is provoked. May it be wife, child or friend Jake would not hesitate to throw his arms around! He packs a punch meaner than Jason Statham of today! The success in ONCE WERE WARRIORS is most certainly her talented cast. Rena Owen puts up a performance that I personally will remember a life time. An actress who has been called one of the most talented actress of her time indeed is worthy of such praise. None will say otherwise once you have seen her in this. The most touching moment is when Rena Owens holds her deceased daughter in her arms in her own back yard; I broke down into tears when I felt her pain. The mix is perfect with Temuera Morrison who stars by Owens side. How these two performances were not acknowledged at the Oscars during its time is question I could not find an answer to. With over 19 awards to its name ONCE WERE WARRIORS is certainly amongst the top 50 movies of the 90s! TITLE: ONCE WERE WARRIORS DIRECTED BY: LEE TAMAHORI STARRING: RENA OWEN, TEMUERA MORRISON AND MAMAENGAROA RATED: R FOR PERVASIVE LANGUAGE AND STRONG DEPECTION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE RATING: 08/10 102 MINUTES

    Once were warriors" 1994 by LeeTamahori is one of the most powerful films I've seen. Violence seems to play a major role throughout the movie; however, I think violence come from a lack of education and low social communication skills. Jake always gets in a fight when he drinks, but that's the way Jake explains his emotion and also he is struggling to fit the society. The last scene, when Grace commit suicide, that was so sad but I think Grace didn't just gave up her life, she wanted to change her family and she saved her family.

    This controversial movie is about a young girl who is trying to make the best of her situation at home, but at the end fails to be happy due to the environment around her. It surprised me when the dad seemed to be a nice guy in the beginning then as soon as he touched alcohol, he turned in a raging bull. It sickened me to see the horrid realities that was happening around this family. The drinking, daily beatings, sexual harassments, all of which happened around the atmosphere of the children. Jake's incontrollable temper leads him to live a life tormenting his family. What i didn't understand was if he was making their lives so horrible why not leave that much sooner? Did the death of Grace have to be the push she needed to know that the environment the children were living in was not safe? Overall this movie moved me and kept me at the edge of my seat especially when sweet Grace turned sour, with all reasons deserved, on her family.

    This film is about a dysfunctional minority family in New Zealand. Beth, the protagonist defies her parents wishes by marrying Jake. In the beginning Jake seems to be a bit rowdy but an OK guy. Later you get to see the real Jake after Beth refuses to do something for him. In this film you witness the breakdown of this family. Nig, one of Beth's sons joins a gang for support. Boogie, Beth's youngest son is removed by child services because he's considered uncontrollable. This leaves Beth and her two daughters to deal with the abusive Jake. This film was very good but hard to watch at times. The violence was brutally realistic and not over the top which made it effects you even more.

    "Once Were Warriors" was a pretty good film. its starts out with a cool laid back family, but then then the family just gets ripped apart. Very violent film in my opinion, it kind of reminds me of a graphic comic book for adults. the film deals with real crazy issues with a family and takes it to a whole another level. The movie reminds me of "the Warriors" just on there style and it's different approach to making a movie. The music that is being played in the film has a type of reggae rock type feel. It goes perfect with this film because reggae has that laid back feel when you are listing to it and the rock music gives the movie some energy and some power.

    What an intense film! The violence that is contained in this project is not gratuitous, rather it is visceral and real to life. I noted that song, language, story and other aspects of culture are ways of combating ongoing colonization of the soul. The character arcs are truly remarkable, and I like the fact the even the villainous characters have some sympathetic traits to them. The sound track is amazing, a Maori-Reggae hybrid that truly rocks. The ending wraps things up in a hopeful message that overcomes tragedies. This film is so specific to the Maori plight post-colonization that it is a universally relevant film. Go and see for yourself!
