 <sinopse>
  A flamboyant and controversial British military figure and his conflicted loyalties during his World War I service in Arabia.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  An inordinately complex man who has been labeled everything from hero, to charlatan, to sadist, Thomas Edward Lawrence blazed his way to glory in the Arabian desert, then sought anonymity as a common soldier under an assumed name. The story opens with the death of Lawrence in a motorcycle accident in Dorset at the age of 46, then flashbacks to recount his adventures: as a young intelligence officer in Cairo in 1916, he is given leave to investigate the progress of the Arab revolt against the Turks in World War I. In the desert, he organizes a guerrilla army and--for two years--leads the Arabs in harassing the Turks with desert raids, train-wrecking and camel attacks. Eventually, he leads his army northward and helps a British General destroy the power of the Ottoman Empire.

    The movie Lawrence of Arabia is about the Arabian tribes during the First World War as they try to reconquer land from the Turkish army. The story starts as the Arab soldiers lead by Prince Faisal retreat from Turkish forces. After the attack, a British officer decided that a group of the soldiers will travel through the Nefud desert and join forces with the Howeitat tribe in order to attack the Turkish base at Aqaba. When they capture the base, they move higher north towards Damascus, along the way sabotaging Turkish railways. They reach the capital before the British are able to take it themselves. But in the end the Arabs leave most city under British control. Although the war between the Arabs and the Turks is a major part of this film, David Lean tries to focus on the British officer T.E. Lawrence. David shows how Lawrence's character changes throughout the movie. At first he depicts him as a high spirited map painter with a curiosity for the desert. As he enters the tribes, he adopts the idea that the Arabs should rule their own country. But the further Lawrence goes into battle his attitude become more aggressive and blood thirsty. In the end he finally leaves the desert all together and heads back to Britain. One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.

    The year is 1962 when this movie released and i cannot imagine the efforts that have gone into making this monumental biography. Hats off to David lean. The shots pictured in the movie and the way they have planned to shoot is unimaginable. Every frame has a compositional brilliance which keeps the audience visually connected to the movie. The director keeps the audience gripped with catchy characters who go on building and connecting to make an amazing plot. Peter O'Toole has given an outstanding performance with really great emotionally conflicting moments on screen. Omar Sharif is a great supporting actor in the entire story. Really a epic masterpiece for anybody who watches.

    So, to start of, I would like to say that this is one of few movies with such amazing environment. Beautiful, and not to mention pompous. David Lean, the director of the film do deserve all the credits he have received. David Lean was able to catch the smallest particle in the desert and make it to the most extraordinary thing you have seen on screen your entire life. But, not to forget, there are two other gentlemen we got to mention and care for. Freddie Young, the photographer and Peter O'Toole himself. Freddie Young's accomplishment with using widescreen and different image compositions is beyond compare! Peter O'Toole with his sparkling blue eyes and his interpretation of T.E Lawrence is peerless. These three men each have a significant part in the work of the classic Lawrence of Arabia. What if David Lean didn't direct the movie, whom would then catch those precious views as David Lean did? Or what if David Lean had chosen Albert Finney as T.E Lawrence (as was planned)? We do not know, we'll never know. But one thing is absolutely sure. A removal of just a few people from the team of Lawrence of Arabia could have ended in an absolute disaster. Everyone had their function.

    The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence. "Lawrence of Arabia" was the epic that redefined cinema forever, not only gave us a cinematic spectacle of grandeur but also gave us one of the most beautiful stories ever told in cinema. By the beginning, the film suggests that it is a biography (which partly is) where we witness Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) suffering a motorcycle accident that leads him to a terrible death. Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence ("T.E" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other. Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery. The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film. The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection. If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. "Lawrence of Arabia" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.

    Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs. The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence. It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact. But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring. Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway? These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy. Look for those detailed sets with the tiny mosaic and wood inlay works, or the wide-angle landscape shots! Amazing ...

    My friend says of this movie: it is an English teachers dream. It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia. Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later. Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams "take no prisoners" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent. On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus. Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation. On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

    What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before? With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor. Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause. History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only Pyrrhic victories against the Turks.

    Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place. So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash. The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: "What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?" To which Lawrence responds in two words: "It's clean." Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered. Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times. My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with "Intermission." "Lawrence Of Arabia" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

    Few films have gained the praise that David Lean's "Lawrence Of Arabia" has. Followed by a both immense critical and commercial success, it is acclaimed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made, in which almost every artistic aspect of it is considered an archetype of great film-making. Starring Peter O'Toole as the title character, it also boasts a lot of great supporting roles, from Alec Guinness to Anthony Quinn. A well-educated but rebellious at heart British officer, Lawrence, is sent in the Arab desert during World War I to fight against the Turks, who were attempting to gain Arabia for themselves. In the desert and in the wars he faces he with guilt finds to be attracted to them. In the course of the movie, Lawrence is able with an army supplied by Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) and with the aid of Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to reach the city of Aqaba, and seize it, and after that he starts a massive assault campaign against the Turks, that will lead him to conquer Damascus as well. In the process, Lawrence's identity remains a mystery, in the sense that neither his true motives nor a solid identity can be pictured. Perhaps the greatest of David Lean films, "Lawrence Of Arabia" is an Epic at its most perfectly formulaic. The exotic setting of the desert, the gorgeous cinematography by Freddie Young, the majestically memorable score by Maurice Jarre, and of course the long winded narrative that results nearly in a four hour movie are all contributing elements to this towering cinematic monster. What maybe robs it of being a perfect achievement is its length, surely an inaccessible one for the average audience, who would need a good lot of will to watch the whole thing. Nevertheless, it's an effort that is extremely worth those four hours. The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Director, Picture, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Sound, and Editing. Only by looking at these awards is it really credible to say this film is a technically and artistically relevant movie, that will haunt you for the rest of your days for its beautiful images and its complex but epic storyline.

One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.

"Lawrence of Arabia" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.

    Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs. The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence. It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact. But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring. Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway? These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy. Look for those detailed sets with the tiny mosaic and wood inlay works, or the wide-angle landscape shots! Amazing ...

    My friend says of this movie: it is an English teachers dream. It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia. Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later. Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams "take no prisoners" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent. On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus. Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation. On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

    What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before? With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor. Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause. History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only Pyrrhic victories against the Turks.

    Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place. So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash. The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: "What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?" To which Lawrence responds in two words: "It's clean." Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered. Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times. My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with "Intermission." "Lawrence Of Arabia" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

    Few films have gained the praise that David Lean's "Lawrence Of Arabia" has. Followed by a both immense critical and commercial success, it is acclaimed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made, in which almost every artistic aspect of it is considered an archetype of great film-making. Starring Peter O'Toole as the title character, it also boasts a lot of great supporting roles, from Alec Guinness to Anthony Quinn. A well-educated but rebellious at heart British officer, Lawrence, is sent in the Arab desert during World War I to fight against the Turks, who were attempting to gain Arabia for themselves. In the desert and in the wars he faces he with guilt finds to be attracted to them. In the course of the movie, Lawrence is able with an army supplied by Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) and with the aid of Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to reach the city of Aqaba, and seize it, and after that he starts a massive assault campaign against the Turks, that will lead him to conquer Damascus as well. In the process, Lawrence's identity remains a mystery, in the sense that neither his true motives nor a solid identity can be pictured. Perhaps the greatest of David Lean films, "Lawrence Of Arabia" is an Epic at its most perfectly formulaic. The exotic setting of the desert, the gorgeous cinematography by Freddie Young, the majestically memorable score by Maurice Jarre, and of course the long winded narrative that results nearly in a four hour movie are all contributing elements to this towering cinematic monster. What maybe robs it of being a perfect achievement is its length, surely an inaccessible one for the average audience, who would need a good lot of will to watch the whole thing. Nevertheless, it's an effort that is extremely worth those four hours. The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Director, Picture, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Sound, and Editing. Only by looking at these awards is it really credible to say this film is a technically and artistically relevant movie, that will haunt you for the rest of your days for its beautiful images and its complex but epic storyline.

    The movie Lawrence of Arabia is about the Arabian tribes during the First World War as they try to reconquer land from the Turkish army. The story starts as the Arab soldiers lead by Prince Faisal retreat from Turkish forces. After the attack, a British officer decided that a group of the soldiers will travel through the Nefud desert and join forces with the Howeitat tribe in order to attack the Turkish base at Aqaba. When they capture the base, they move higher north towards Damascus, along the way sabotaging Turkish railways. They reach the capital before the British are able to take it themselves. But in the end the Arabs leave most city under British control. Although the war between the Arabs and the Turks is a major part of this film, David Lean tries to focus on the British officer T.E. Lawrence. David shows how Lawrence's character changes throughout the movie. At first he depicts him as a high spirited map painter with a curiosity for the desert. As he enters the tribes, he adopts the idea that the Arabs should rule their own country. But the further Lawrence goes into battle his attitude become more aggressive and blood thirsty. In the end he finally leaves the desert all together and heads back to Britain. One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.

    The year is 1962 when this movie released and i cannot imagine the efforts that have gone into making this monumental biography. Hats off to David lean. The shots pictured in the movie and the way they have planned to shoot is unimaginable. Every frame has a compositional brilliance which keeps the audience visually connected to the movie. The director keeps the audience gripped with catchy characters who go on building and connecting to make an amazing plot. Peter O'Toole has given an outstanding performance with really great emotionally conflicting moments on screen. Omar Sharif is a great supporting actor in the entire story. Really a epic masterpiece for anybody who watches.

    So, to start of, I would like to say that this is one of few movies with such amazing environment. Beautiful, and not to mention pompous. David Lean, the director of the film do deserve all the credits he have received. David Lean was able to catch the smallest particle in the desert and make it to the most extraordinary thing you have seen on screen your entire life. But, not to forget, there are two other gentlemen we got to mention and care for. Freddie Young, the photographer and Peter O'Toole himself. Freddie Young's accomplishment with using widescreen and different image compositions is beyond compare! Peter O'Toole with his sparkling blue eyes and his interpretation of T.E Lawrence is peerless. These three men each have a significant part in the work of the classic Lawrence of Arabia. What if David Lean didn't direct the movie, whom would then catch those precious views as David Lean did? Or what if David Lean had chosen Albert Finney as T.E Lawrence (as was planned)? We do not know, we'll never know. But one thing is absolutely sure. A removal of just a few people from the team of Lawrence of Arabia could have ended in an absolute disaster. Everyone had their function.

    The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence. "Lawrence of Arabia" was the epic that redefined cinema forever, not only gave us a cinematic spectacle of grandeur but also gave us one of the most beautiful stories ever told in cinema. By the beginning, the film suggests that it is a biography (which partly is) where we witness Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) suffering a motorcycle accident that leads him to a terrible death. Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence ("T.E" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other. Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery. The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film. The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection. If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. "Lawrence of Arabia" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.

    Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place. So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash. The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: "What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?" To which Lawrence responds in two words: "It's clean." Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered. Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times. My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with "Intermission." "Lawrence Of Arabia" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

    Few films have gained the praise that David Lean's "Lawrence Of Arabia" has. Followed by a both immense critical and commercial success, it is acclaimed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made, in which almost every artistic aspect of it is considered an archetype of great film-making. Starring Peter O'Toole as the title character, it also boasts a lot of great supporting roles, from Alec Guinness to Anthony Quinn. A well-educated but rebellious at heart British officer, Lawrence, is sent in the Arab desert during World War I to fight against the Turks, who were attempting to gain Arabia for themselves. In the desert and in the wars he faces he with guilt finds to be attracted to them. In the course of the movie, Lawrence is able with an army supplied by Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) and with the aid of Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to reach the city of Aqaba, and seize it, and after that he starts a massive assault campaign against the Turks, that will lead him to conquer Damascus as well. In the process, Lawrence's identity remains a mystery, in the sense that neither his true motives nor a solid identity can be pictured. Perhaps the greatest of David Lean films, "Lawrence Of Arabia" is an Epic at its most perfectly formulaic. The exotic setting of the desert, the gorgeous cinematography by Freddie Young, the majestically memorable score by Maurice Jarre, and of course the long winded narrative that results nearly in a four hour movie are all contributing elements to this towering cinematic monster. What maybe robs it of being a perfect achievement is its length, surely an inaccessible one for the average audience, who would need a good lot of will to watch the whole thing. Nevertheless, it's an effort that is extremely worth those four hours. The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Director, Picture, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Sound, and Editing. Only by looking at these awards is it really credible to say this film is a technically and artistically relevant movie, that will haunt you for the rest of your days for its beautiful images and its complex but epic storyline.

    The movie Lawrence of Arabia is about the Arabian tribes during the First World War as they try to reconquer land from the Turkish army. The story starts as the Arab soldiers lead by Prince Faisal retreat from Turkish forces. After the attack, a British officer decided that a group of the soldiers will travel through the Nefud desert and join forces with the Howeitat tribe in order to attack the Turkish base at Aqaba. When they capture the base, they move higher north towards Damascus, along the way sabotaging Turkish railways. They reach the capital before the British are able to take it themselves. But in the end the Arabs leave most city under British control. Although the war between the Arabs and the Turks is a major part of this film, David Lean tries to focus on the British officer T.E. Lawrence. David shows how Lawrence's character changes throughout the movie. At first he depicts him as a high spirited map painter with a curiosity for the desert. As he enters the tribes, he adopts the idea that the Arabs should rule their own country. But the further Lawrence goes into battle his attitude become more aggressive and blood thirsty. In the end he finally leaves the desert all together and heads back to Britain. One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.

    The year is 1962 when this movie released and i cannot imagine the efforts that have gone into making this monumental biography. Hats off to David lean. The shots pictured in the movie and the way they have planned to shoot is unimaginable. Every frame has a compositional brilliance which keeps the audience visually connected to the movie. The director keeps the audience gripped with catchy characters who go on building and connecting to make an amazing plot. Peter O'Toole has given an outstanding performance with really great emotionally conflicting moments on screen. Omar Sharif is a great supporting actor in the entire story. Really a epic masterpiece for anybody who watches.

    So, to start of, I would like to say that this is one of few movies with such amazing environment. Beautiful, and not to mention pompous. David Lean, the director of the film do deserve all the credits he have received. David Lean was able to catch the smallest particle in the desert and make it to the most extraordinary thing you have seen on screen your entire life. But, not to forget, there are two other gentlemen we got to mention and care for. Freddie Young, the photographer and Peter O'Toole himself. Freddie Young's accomplishment with using widescreen and different image compositions is beyond compare! Peter O'Toole with his sparkling blue eyes and his interpretation of T.E Lawrence is peerless. These three men each have a significant part in the work of the classic Lawrence of Arabia. What if David Lean didn't direct the movie, whom would then catch those precious views as David Lean did? Or what if David Lean had chosen Albert Finney as T.E Lawrence (as was planned)? We do not know, we'll never know. But one thing is absolutely sure. A removal of just a few people from the team of Lawrence of Arabia could have ended in an absolute disaster. Everyone had their function.

    The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence. "Lawrence of Arabia" was the epic that redefined cinema forever, not only gave us a cinematic spectacle of grandeur but also gave us one of the most beautiful stories ever told in cinema. By the beginning, the film suggests that it is a biography (which partly is) where we witness Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) suffering a motorcycle accident that leads him to a terrible death. Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence ("T.E" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other. Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery. The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film. The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection. If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. "Lawrence of Arabia" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.

    Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs. The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence. It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact. But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring. Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway? These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy. Look for those detailed sets with the tiny mosaic and wood inlay works, or the wide-angle landscape shots! Amazing ...

    My friend says of this movie: it is an English teachers dream. It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia. Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later. Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams "take no prisoners" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent. On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus. Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation. On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

    What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before? With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor. Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause. History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only Pyrrhic victories against the Turks.

Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence ("T.E" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other. Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery. The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film. The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection. If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. "Lawrence of Arabia" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.

    Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs. The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence. It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact. But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring. Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway? These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy. Look for those detailed sets with the tiny mosaic and wood inlay works, or the wide-angle landscape shots! Amazing ...

    My friend says of this movie: it is an English teachers dream. It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia. Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later. Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams "take no prisoners" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent. On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus. Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation. On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

    What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before? With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor. Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause. History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only Pyrrhic victories against the Turks.

    Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place. So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash. The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: "What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?" To which Lawrence responds in two words: "It's clean." Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered. Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times. My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with "Intermission." "Lawrence Of Arabia" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

    Few films have gained the praise that David Lean's "Lawrence Of Arabia" has. Followed by a both immense critical and commercial success, it is acclaimed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made, in which almost every artistic aspect of it is considered an archetype of great film-making. Starring Peter O'Toole as the title character, it also boasts a lot of great supporting roles, from Alec Guinness to Anthony Quinn. A well-educated but rebellious at heart British officer, Lawrence, is sent in the Arab desert during World War I to fight against the Turks, who were attempting to gain Arabia for themselves. In the desert and in the wars he faces he with guilt finds to be attracted to them. In the course of the movie, Lawrence is able with an army supplied by Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) and with the aid of Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to reach the city of Aqaba, and seize it, and after that he starts a massive assault campaign against the Turks, that will lead him to conquer Damascus as well. In the process, Lawrence's identity remains a mystery, in the sense that neither his true motives nor a solid identity can be pictured. Perhaps the greatest of David Lean films, "Lawrence Of Arabia" is an Epic at its most perfectly formulaic. The exotic setting of the desert, the gorgeous cinematography by Freddie Young, the majestically memorable score by Maurice Jarre, and of course the long winded narrative that results nearly in a four hour movie are all contributing elements to this towering cinematic monster. What maybe robs it of being a perfect achievement is its length, surely an inaccessible one for the average audience, who would need a good lot of will to watch the whole thing. Nevertheless, it's an effort that is extremely worth those four hours. The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Director, Picture, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Sound, and Editing. Only by looking at these awards is it really credible to say this film is a technically and artistically relevant movie, that will haunt you for the rest of your days for its beautiful images and its complex but epic storyline.

    The movie Lawrence of Arabia is about the Arabian tribes during the First World War as they try to reconquer land from the Turkish army. The story starts as the Arab soldiers lead by Prince Faisal retreat from Turkish forces. After the attack, a British officer decided that a group of the soldiers will travel through the Nefud desert and join forces with the Howeitat tribe in order to attack the Turkish base at Aqaba. When they capture the base, they move higher north towards Damascus, along the way sabotaging Turkish railways. They reach the capital before the British are able to take it themselves. But in the end the Arabs leave most city under British control. Although the war between the Arabs and the Turks is a major part of this film, David Lean tries to focus on the British officer T.E. Lawrence. David shows how Lawrence's character changes throughout the movie. At first he depicts him as a high spirited map painter with a curiosity for the desert. As he enters the tribes, he adopts the idea that the Arabs should rule their own country. But the further Lawrence goes into battle his attitude become more aggressive and blood thirsty. In the end he finally leaves the desert all together and heads back to Britain. One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.

    The year is 1962 when this movie released and i cannot imagine the efforts that have gone into making this monumental biography. Hats off to David lean. The shots pictured in the movie and the way they have planned to shoot is unimaginable. Every frame has a compositional brilliance which keeps the audience visually connected to the movie. The director keeps the audience gripped with catchy characters who go on building and connecting to make an amazing plot. Peter O'Toole has given an outstanding performance with really great emotionally conflicting moments on screen. Omar Sharif is a great supporting actor in the entire story. Really a epic masterpiece for anybody who watches.

    So, to start of, I would like to say that this is one of few movies with such amazing environment. Beautiful, and not to mention pompous. David Lean, the director of the film do deserve all the credits he have received. David Lean was able to catch the smallest particle in the desert and make it to the most extraordinary thing you have seen on screen your entire life. But, not to forget, there are two other gentlemen we got to mention and care for. Freddie Young, the photographer and Peter O'Toole himself. Freddie Young's accomplishment with using widescreen and different image compositions is beyond compare! Peter O'Toole with his sparkling blue eyes and his interpretation of T.E Lawrence is peerless. These three men each have a significant part in the work of the classic Lawrence of Arabia. What if David Lean didn't direct the movie, whom would then catch those precious views as David Lean did? Or what if David Lean had chosen Albert Finney as T.E Lawrence (as was planned)? We do not know, we'll never know. But one thing is absolutely sure. A removal of just a few people from the team of Lawrence of Arabia could have ended in an absolute disaster. Everyone had their function.

    The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence.

The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

    What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before? With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor. Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause. History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only Pyrrhic victories against the Turks.

    Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place. So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash. The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: "What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?" To which Lawrence responds in two words: "It's clean." Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered. Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times. My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with "Intermission." "Lawrence Of Arabia" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

    Few films have gained the praise that David Lean's "Lawrence Of Arabia" has. Followed by a both immense critical and commercial success, it is acclaimed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made, in which almost every artistic aspect of it is considered an archetype of great film-making. Starring Peter O'Toole as the title character, it also boasts a lot of great supporting roles, from Alec Guinness to Anthony Quinn. A well-educated but rebellious at heart British officer, Lawrence, is sent in the Arab desert during World War I to fight against the Turks, who were attempting to gain Arabia for themselves. In the desert and in the wars he faces he with guilt finds to be attracted to them. In the course of the movie, Lawrence is able with an army supplied by Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) and with the aid of Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to reach the city of Aqaba, and seize it, and after that he starts a massive assault campaign against the Turks, that will lead him to conquer Damascus as well. In the process, Lawrence's identity remains a mystery, in the sense that neither his true motives nor a solid identity can be pictured. Perhaps the greatest of David Lean films, "Lawrence Of Arabia" is an Epic at its most perfectly formulaic. The exotic setting of the desert, the gorgeous cinematography by Freddie Young, the majestically memorable score by Maurice Jarre, and of course the long winded narrative that results nearly in a four hour movie are all contributing elements to this towering cinematic monster. What maybe robs it of being a perfect achievement is its length, surely an inaccessible one for the average audience, who would need a good lot of will to watch the whole thing. Nevertheless, it's an effort that is extremely worth those four hours. The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Director, Picture, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Sound, and Editing. Only by looking at these awards is it really credible to say this film is a technically and artistically relevant movie, that will haunt you for the rest of your days for its beautiful images and its complex but epic storyline.

    The movie Lawrence of Arabia is about the Arabian tribes during the First World War as they try to reconquer land from the Turkish army. The story starts as the Arab soldiers lead by Prince Faisal retreat from Turkish forces. After the attack, a British officer decided that a group of the soldiers will travel through the Nefud desert and join forces with the Howeitat tribe in order to attack the Turkish base at Aqaba. When they capture the base, they move higher north towards Damascus, along the way sabotaging Turkish railways. They reach the capital before the British are able to take it themselves. But in the end the Arabs leave most city under British control. Although the war between the Arabs and the Turks is a major part of this film, David Lean tries to focus on the British officer T.E. Lawrence. David shows how Lawrence's character changes throughout the movie. At first he depicts him as a high spirited map painter with a curiosity for the desert. As he enters the tribes, he adopts the idea that the Arabs should rule their own country. But the further Lawrence goes into battle his attitude become more aggressive and blood thirsty. In the end he finally leaves the desert all together and heads back to Britain. One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.

    The year is 1962 when this movie released and i cannot imagine the efforts that have gone into making this monumental biography. Hats off to David lean. The shots pictured in the movie and the way they have planned to shoot is unimaginable. Every frame has a compositional brilliance which keeps the audience visually connected to the movie. The director keeps the audience gripped with catchy characters who go on building and connecting to make an amazing plot. Peter O'Toole has given an outstanding performance with really great emotionally conflicting moments on screen. Omar Sharif is a great supporting actor in the entire story. Really a epic masterpiece for anybody who watches.

    So, to start of, I would like to say that this is one of few movies with such amazing environment. Beautiful, and not to mention pompous. David Lean, the director of the film do deserve all the credits he have received. David Lean was able to catch the smallest particle in the desert and make it to the most extraordinary thing you have seen on screen your entire life. But, not to forget, there are two other gentlemen we got to mention and care for. Freddie Young, the photographer and Peter O'Toole himself. Freddie Young's accomplishment with using widescreen and different image compositions is beyond compare! Peter O'Toole with his sparkling blue eyes and his interpretation of T.E Lawrence is peerless. These three men each have a significant part in the work of the classic Lawrence of Arabia. What if David Lean didn't direct the movie, whom would then catch those precious views as David Lean did? Or what if David Lean had chosen Albert Finney as T.E Lawrence (as was planned)? We do not know, we'll never know. But one thing is absolutely sure. A removal of just a few people from the team of Lawrence of Arabia could have ended in an absolute disaster. Everyone had their function.

    The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence. "Lawrence of Arabia" was the epic that redefined cinema forever, not only gave us a cinematic spectacle of grandeur but also gave us one of the most beautiful stories ever told in cinema. By the beginning, the film suggests that it is a biography (which partly is) where we witness Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) suffering a motorcycle accident that leads him to a terrible death. Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence ("T.E" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other. Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery. The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film. The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection. If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. "Lawrence of Arabia" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.

    Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs. The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence. It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact. But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring. Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway? These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy. Look for those detailed sets with the tiny mosaic and wood inlay works, or the wide-angle landscape shots! Amazing ...

    My friend says of this movie: it is an English teachers dream. It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia. Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later. Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams "take no prisoners" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent. On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus. Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation. On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

Peter O'Toole has given an outstanding performance with really great emotionally conflicting moments on screen. Omar Sharif is a great supporting actor in the entire story. Really a epic masterpiece for anybody who watches.

    So, to start of, I would like to say that this is one of few movies with such amazing environment. Beautiful, and not to mention pompous. David Lean, the director of the film do deserve all the credits he have received. David Lean was able to catch the smallest particle in the desert and make it to the most extraordinary thing you have seen on screen your entire life. But, not to forget, there are two other gentlemen we got to mention and care for. Freddie Young, the photographer and Peter O'Toole himself. Freddie Young's accomplishment with using widescreen and different image compositions is beyond compare! Peter O'Toole with his sparkling blue eyes and his interpretation of T.E Lawrence is peerless. These three men each have a significant part in the work of the classic Lawrence of Arabia. What if David Lean didn't direct the movie, whom would then catch those precious views as David Lean did? Or what if David Lean had chosen Albert Finney as T.E Lawrence (as was planned)? We do not know, we'll never know. But one thing is absolutely sure. A removal of just a few people from the team of Lawrence of Arabia could have ended in an absolute disaster. Everyone had their function.

    The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence. "Lawrence of Arabia" was the epic that redefined cinema forever, not only gave us a cinematic spectacle of grandeur but also gave us one of the most beautiful stories ever told in cinema. By the beginning, the film suggests that it is a biography (which partly is) where we witness Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) suffering a motorcycle accident that leads him to a terrible death. Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence ("T.E" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other. Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery. The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film. The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection. If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. "Lawrence of Arabia" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.

    Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs. The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence. It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact. But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring. Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway? These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy. Look for those detailed sets with the tiny mosaic and wood inlay works, or the wide-angle landscape shots! Amazing ...

    My friend says of this movie: it is an English teachers dream. It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia. Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later. Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams "take no prisoners" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent. On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus. Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation. On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

    What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before? With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor. Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause. History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only Pyrrhic victories against the Turks.

    Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place. So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash. The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: "What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?" To which Lawrence responds in two words: "It's clean." Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered. Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times. My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with "Intermission." "Lawrence Of Arabia" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

    Few films have gained the praise that David Lean's "Lawrence Of Arabia" has. Followed by a both immense critical and commercial success, it is acclaimed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made, in which almost every artistic aspect of it is considered an archetype of great film-making. Starring Peter O'Toole as the title character, it also boasts a lot of great supporting roles, from Alec Guinness to Anthony Quinn. A well-educated but rebellious at heart British officer, Lawrence, is sent in the Arab desert during World War I to fight against the Turks, who were attempting to gain Arabia for themselves. In the desert and in the wars he faces he with guilt finds to be attracted to them. In the course of the movie, Lawrence is able with an army supplied by Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) and with the aid of Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to reach the city of Aqaba, and seize it, and after that he starts a massive assault campaign against the Turks, that will lead him to conquer Damascus as well. In the process, Lawrence's identity remains a mystery, in the sense that neither his true motives nor a solid identity can be pictured. Perhaps the greatest of David Lean films, "Lawrence Of Arabia" is an Epic at its most perfectly formulaic. The exotic setting of the desert, the gorgeous cinematography by Freddie Young, the majestically memorable score by Maurice Jarre, and of course the long winded narrative that results nearly in a four hour movie are all contributing elements to this towering cinematic monster. What maybe robs it of being a perfect achievement is its length, surely an inaccessible one for the average audience, who would need a good lot of will to watch the whole thing. Nevertheless, it's an effort that is extremely worth those four hours. The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Director, Picture, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Sound, and Editing. Only by looking at these awards is it really credible to say this film is a technically and artistically relevant movie, that will haunt you for the rest of your days for its beautiful images and its complex but epic storyline.

    The movie Lawrence of Arabia is about the Arabian tribes during the First World War as they try to reconquer land from the Turkish army. The story starts as the Arab soldiers lead by Prince Faisal retreat from Turkish forces. After the attack, a British officer decided that a group of the soldiers will travel through the Nefud desert and join forces with the Howeitat tribe in order to attack the Turkish base at Aqaba. When they capture the base, they move higher north towards Damascus, along the way sabotaging Turkish railways. They reach the capital before the British are able to take it themselves. But in the end the Arabs leave most city under British control. Although the war between the Arabs and the Turks is a major part of this film, David Lean tries to focus on the British officer T.E. Lawrence. David shows how Lawrence's character changes throughout the movie. At first he depicts him as a high spirited map painter with a curiosity for the desert. As he enters the tribes, he adopts the idea that the Arabs should rule their own country. But the further Lawrence goes into battle his attitude become more aggressive and blood thirsty. In the end he finally leaves the desert all together and heads back to Britain. One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.

As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later. Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams "take no prisoners" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent. On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus. Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation. On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

    What more can be said about this groundbreaking film from 1962 that has not already been said before? With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor. Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause. History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only Pyrrhic victories against the Turks.

    Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place. So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash. The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: "What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?" To which Lawrence responds in two words: "It's clean." Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered. Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times. My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with "Intermission." "Lawrence Of Arabia" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

    Few films have gained the praise that David Lean's "Lawrence Of Arabia" has. Followed by a both immense critical and commercial success, it is acclaimed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever made, in which almost every artistic aspect of it is considered an archetype of great film-making. Starring Peter O'Toole as the title character, it also boasts a lot of great supporting roles, from Alec Guinness to Anthony Quinn. A well-educated but rebellious at heart British officer, Lawrence, is sent in the Arab desert during World War I to fight against the Turks, who were attempting to gain Arabia for themselves. In the desert and in the wars he faces he with guilt finds to be attracted to them. In the course of the movie, Lawrence is able with an army supplied by Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) and with the aid of Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to reach the city of Aqaba, and seize it, and after that he starts a massive assault campaign against the Turks, that will lead him to conquer Damascus as well. In the process, Lawrence's identity remains a mystery, in the sense that neither his true motives nor a solid identity can be pictured. Perhaps the greatest of David Lean films, "Lawrence Of Arabia" is an Epic at its most perfectly formulaic. The exotic setting of the desert, the gorgeous cinematography by Freddie Young, the majestically memorable score by Maurice Jarre, and of course the long winded narrative that results nearly in a four hour movie are all contributing elements to this towering cinematic monster. What maybe robs it of being a perfect achievement is its length, surely an inaccessible one for the average audience, who would need a good lot of will to watch the whole thing. Nevertheless, it's an effort that is extremely worth those four hours. The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Director, Picture, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Sound, and Editing. Only by looking at these awards is it really credible to say this film is a technically and artistically relevant movie, that will haunt you for the rest of your days for its beautiful images and its complex but epic storyline.

    The movie Lawrence of Arabia is about the Arabian tribes during the First World War as they try to reconquer land from the Turkish army. The story starts as the Arab soldiers lead by Prince Faisal retreat from Turkish forces. After the attack, a British officer decided that a group of the soldiers will travel through the Nefud desert and join forces with the Howeitat tribe in order to attack the Turkish base at Aqaba. When they capture the base, they move higher north towards Damascus, along the way sabotaging Turkish railways. They reach the capital before the British are able to take it themselves. But in the end the Arabs leave most city under British control. Although the war between the Arabs and the Turks is a major part of this film, David Lean tries to focus on the British officer T.E. Lawrence. David shows how Lawrence's character changes throughout the movie. At first he depicts him as a high spirited map painter with a curiosity for the desert. As he enters the tribes, he adopts the idea that the Arabs should rule their own country. But the further Lawrence goes into battle his attitude become more aggressive and blood thirsty. In the end he finally leaves the desert all together and heads back to Britain. One of the things that I find interesting in this movie is how in some scenes the view is drawn back, taking the viewer out of the main characters and allowing us to see the full scene as it passes through. There are many examples of this throughout the film. The first one being the entrance of Sheriff Ali to the well as he kills Lawrence's guide. It shows that while the desert is a vast and desolate place there are still feuds between the few people that live there. There is also another scene where the soldiers and Lawrence travel through the Nefud desert. Allowing us to see that the only thing besides the soldiers are there camels and the scorching sun pounding down upon them.

    The year is 1962 when this movie released and i cannot imagine the efforts that have gone into making this monumental biography. Hats off to David lean. The shots pictured in the movie and the way they have planned to shoot is unimaginable. Every frame has a compositional brilliance which keeps the audience visually connected to the movie. The director keeps the audience gripped with catchy characters who go on building and connecting to make an amazing plot. Peter O'Toole has given an outstanding performance with really great emotionally conflicting moments on screen. Omar Sharif is a great supporting actor in the entire story. Really a epic masterpiece for anybody who watches.

    So, to start of, I would like to say that this is one of few movies with such amazing environment. Beautiful, and not to mention pompous. David Lean, the director of the film do deserve all the credits he have received. David Lean was able to catch the smallest particle in the desert and make it to the most extraordinary thing you have seen on screen your entire life. But, not to forget, there are two other gentlemen we got to mention and care for. Freddie Young, the photographer and Peter O'Toole himself. Freddie Young's accomplishment with using widescreen and different image compositions is beyond compare! Peter O'Toole with his sparkling blue eyes and his interpretation of T.E Lawrence is peerless. These three men each have a significant part in the work of the classic Lawrence of Arabia. What if David Lean didn't direct the movie, whom would then catch those precious views as David Lean did? Or what if David Lean had chosen Albert Finney as T.E Lawrence (as was planned)? We do not know, we'll never know. But one thing is absolutely sure. A removal of just a few people from the team of Lawrence of Arabia could have ended in an absolute disaster. Everyone had their function.

    The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence. "Lawrence of Arabia" was the epic that redefined cinema forever, not only gave us a cinematic spectacle of grandeur but also gave us one of the most beautiful stories ever told in cinema. By the beginning, the film suggests that it is a biography (which partly is) where we witness Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) suffering a motorcycle accident that leads him to a terrible death. Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence ("T.E" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other. Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery. The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film. The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection. If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. "Lawrence of Arabia" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.

    Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs. The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence. It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact. But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring. Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway? These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy. Look for those detailed sets with the tiny mosaic and wood inlay works, or the wide-angle landscape shots! Amazing ...

    My friend says of this movie: it is an English teachers dream. It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia. Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later. Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams "take no prisoners" and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent. On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus. Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation. On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.
