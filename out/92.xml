    The first thing I did after my 'Tarantino XX' Blu-Ray set arrived was watch True Romance, the only film included that I had not previously seen, along with Death Proof which I shall be watching soon. What is interesting about its inclusion in the set is the fact that it is the only film included that is not directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is well known that Tarantino wrote two screenplays based on romantic duos: True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He sold the latter (which I have not seen) to Oliver Stone however that is not included in the set due to his dislike towards Stone's take on the script which is criticised for removing much of the satirical elements of Tarantino's original story. With True Romance, Tarantino's attitude is different with the director approving of Tony Scott's take on the film with much of the original screenplay intact, something which is clearly evident throughout the film and something that makes it as good as it is. With the screenplay so good I honestly believe that with Tarantino also behind this camera then this film may now viewed at the same level of his most famous film  Pulp Fiction. The film has all the elements of a typical Tarantino film with the same fast-paced and enjoyable formula that we expect from the director, the film is filled with fantastic and memorable references, pop culture references and references to plenty of other films  the Vietnam and Oscar awards conversation where Tarantino pays homage to some of his personal favourite films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Rio Bravo. The biggest film inspiration evident is Terrence Malick's classic Badlands, a clear influence on both of Tarantino's romantic screenplays. This inspiration is portrayed clearly in the film with the same charming yet haunting sounds of Carl Orff that were used in Badlands used in Hans Zimmer's score, with the voice-over from the film's female protagonist Alabama sounding almost identical to that of Sissy Spacek's character Holly in Badlands. The film has perhaps one of my favourite casts of all time with a fantastic ensemble of great actors including a few that would later go on to appear in the films of Tarantino such as Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

    Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception! I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too! One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has "Clarence", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather "Alabama" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says "I'm the Anti-Christ" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called "Mentor" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it! People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme

    True Romance is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by a better director Tony Scott. It's a action/romance film about film geek and a callgirl who steal coke from the mob and get away with it. I'm not a huge Tarantino fan and this film encompass the best and worst of the guy. I don't like dialog that's 90% movie references and direct quotes from other sources. Thankfully, in True Romance this wasn't that much of an issue and it worked well in the films favor. With with exceptions, it felt something like a real movie not a collage of ideas taken from other sources. This why Tarantino's scripts should be directed by other directors to reign in the fanboy nature of his works. And when this happens the film never runs longer than two hours, the pacing is great and it doesn't feel as self-indulgent as his other works. My only other problem with the film where the two lovebirds played by Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater. When compared to the rest of the cast, their performances paled in comparison. Aside from those minor inconveniences, True Romance has a great ensemble cast, great dialog, some really intense scenes and it's just fun. Liked it quite a bit but don't love it...

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.

Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

    Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception! I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too! One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has "Clarence", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather "Alabama" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says "I'm the Anti-Christ" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called "Mentor" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it! People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme

    True Romance is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by a better director Tony Scott. It's a action/romance film about film geek and a callgirl who steal coke from the mob and get away with it. I'm not a huge Tarantino fan and this film encompass the best and worst of the guy. I don't like dialog that's 90% movie references and direct quotes from other sources. Thankfully, in True Romance this wasn't that much of an issue and it worked well in the films favor. With with exceptions, it felt something like a real movie not a collage of ideas taken from other sources. This why Tarantino's scripts should be directed by other directors to reign in the fanboy nature of his works. And when this happens the film never runs longer than two hours, the pacing is great and it doesn't feel as self-indulgent as his other works. My only other problem with the film where the two lovebirds played by Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater. When compared to the rest of the cast, their performances paled in comparison. Aside from those minor inconveniences, True Romance has a great ensemble cast, great dialog, some really intense scenes and it's just fun. Liked it quite a bit but don't love it...

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.

    The first thing I did after my 'Tarantino XX' Blu-Ray set arrived was watch True Romance, the only film included that I had not previously seen, along with Death Proof which I shall be watching soon. What is interesting about its inclusion in the set is the fact that it is the only film included that is not directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is well known that Tarantino wrote two screenplays based on romantic duos: True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He sold the latter (which I have not seen) to Oliver Stone however that is not included in the set due to his dislike towards Stone's take on the script which is criticised for removing much of the satirical elements of Tarantino's original story. With True Romance, Tarantino's attitude is different with the director approving of Tony Scott's take on the film with much of the original screenplay intact, something which is clearly evident throughout the film and something that makes it as good as it is. With the screenplay so good I honestly believe that with Tarantino also behind this camera then this film may now viewed at the same level of his most famous film  Pulp Fiction. The film has all the elements of a typical Tarantino film with the same fast-paced and enjoyable formula that we expect from the director, the film is filled with fantastic and memorable references, pop culture references and references to plenty of other films  the Vietnam and Oscar awards conversation where Tarantino pays homage to some of his personal favourite films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Rio Bravo. The biggest film inspiration evident is Terrence Malick's classic Badlands, a clear influence on both of Tarantino's romantic screenplays. This inspiration is portrayed clearly in the film with the same charming yet haunting sounds of Carl Orff that were used in Badlands used in Hans Zimmer's score, with the voice-over from the film's female protagonist Alabama sounding almost identical to that of Sissy Spacek's character Holly in Badlands. The film has perhaps one of my favourite casts of all time with a fantastic ensemble of great actors including a few that would later go on to appear in the films of Tarantino such as Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it!

    True Romance is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by a better director Tony Scott. It's a action/romance film about film geek and a callgirl who steal coke from the mob and get away with it. I'm not a huge Tarantino fan and this film encompass the best and worst of the guy. I don't like dialog that's 90% movie references and direct quotes from other sources. Thankfully, in True Romance this wasn't that much of an issue and it worked well in the films favor. With with exceptions, it felt something like a real movie not a collage of ideas taken from other sources. This why Tarantino's scripts should be directed by other directors to reign in the fanboy nature of his works. And when this happens the film never runs longer than two hours, the pacing is great and it doesn't feel as self-indulgent as his other works. My only other problem with the film where the two lovebirds played by Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater. When compared to the rest of the cast, their performances paled in comparison. Aside from those minor inconveniences, True Romance has a great ensemble cast, great dialog, some really intense scenes and it's just fun. Liked it quite a bit but don't love it...

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.

    The first thing I did after my 'Tarantino XX' Blu-Ray set arrived was watch True Romance, the only film included that I had not previously seen, along with Death Proof which I shall be watching soon. What is interesting about its inclusion in the set is the fact that it is the only film included that is not directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is well known that Tarantino wrote two screenplays based on romantic duos: True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He sold the latter (which I have not seen) to Oliver Stone however that is not included in the set due to his dislike towards Stone's take on the script which is criticised for removing much of the satirical elements of Tarantino's original story. With True Romance, Tarantino's attitude is different with the director approving of Tony Scott's take on the film with much of the original screenplay intact, something which is clearly evident throughout the film and something that makes it as good as it is. With the screenplay so good I honestly believe that with Tarantino also behind this camera then this film may now viewed at the same level of his most famous film  Pulp Fiction. The film has all the elements of a typical Tarantino film with the same fast-paced and enjoyable formula that we expect from the director, the film is filled with fantastic and memorable references, pop culture references and references to plenty of other films  the Vietnam and Oscar awards conversation where Tarantino pays homage to some of his personal favourite films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Rio Bravo. The biggest film inspiration evident is Terrence Malick's classic Badlands, a clear influence on both of Tarantino's romantic screenplays. This inspiration is portrayed clearly in the film with the same charming yet haunting sounds of Carl Orff that were used in Badlands used in Hans Zimmer's score, with the voice-over from the film's female protagonist Alabama sounding almost identical to that of Sissy Spacek's character Holly in Badlands. The film has perhaps one of my favourite casts of all time with a fantastic ensemble of great actors including a few that would later go on to appear in the films of Tarantino such as Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

    Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception! I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too! One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has "Clarence", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather "Alabama" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says "I'm the Anti-Christ" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called "Mentor" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it! People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.

    The first thing I did after my 'Tarantino XX' Blu-Ray set arrived was watch True Romance, the only film included that I had not previously seen, along with Death Proof which I shall be watching soon. What is interesting about its inclusion in the set is the fact that it is the only film included that is not directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is well known that Tarantino wrote two screenplays based on romantic duos: True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He sold the latter (which I have not seen) to Oliver Stone however that is not included in the set due to his dislike towards Stone's take on the script which is criticised for removing much of the satirical elements of Tarantino's original story. With True Romance, Tarantino's attitude is different with the director approving of Tony Scott's take on the film with much of the original screenplay intact, something which is clearly evident throughout the film and something that makes it as good as it is. With the screenplay so good I honestly believe that with Tarantino also behind this camera then this film may now viewed at the same level of his most famous film  Pulp Fiction. The film has all the elements of a typical Tarantino film with the same fast-paced and enjoyable formula that we expect from the director, the film is filled with fantastic and memorable references, pop culture references and references to plenty of other films  the Vietnam and Oscar awards conversation where Tarantino pays homage to some of his personal favourite films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Rio Bravo. The biggest film inspiration evident is Terrence Malick's classic Badlands, a clear influence on both of Tarantino's romantic screenplays. This inspiration is portrayed clearly in the film with the same charming yet haunting sounds of Carl Orff that were used in Badlands used in Hans Zimmer's score, with the voice-over from the film's female protagonist Alabama sounding almost identical to that of Sissy Spacek's character Holly in Badlands. The film has perhaps one of my favourite casts of all time with a fantastic ensemble of great actors including a few that would later go on to appear in the films of Tarantino such as Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

    Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception! I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too! One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has "Clarence", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather "Alabama" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says "I'm the Anti-Christ" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called "Mentor" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it! People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme

    True Romance is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by a better director Tony Scott. It's a action/romance film about film geek and a callgirl who steal coke from the mob and get away with it. I'm not a huge Tarantino fan and this film encompass the best and worst of the guy. I don't like dialog that's 90% movie references and direct quotes from other sources. Thankfully, in True Romance this wasn't that much of an issue and it worked well in the films favor. With with exceptions, it felt something like a real movie not a collage of ideas taken from other sources. This why Tarantino's scripts should be directed by other directors to reign in the fanboy nature of his works. And when this happens the film never runs longer than two hours, the pacing is great and it doesn't feel as self-indulgent as his other works. My only other problem with the film where the two lovebirds played by Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater. When compared to the rest of the cast, their performances paled in comparison. Aside from those minor inconveniences, True Romance has a great ensemble cast, great dialog, some really intense scenes and it's just fun. Liked it quite a bit but don't love it...

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.

    The first thing I did after my 'Tarantino XX' Blu-Ray set arrived was watch True Romance, the only film included that I had not previously seen, along with Death Proof which I shall be watching soon. What is interesting about its inclusion in the set is the fact that it is the only film included that is not directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is well known that Tarantino wrote two screenplays based on romantic duos: True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He sold the latter (which I have not seen) to Oliver Stone however that is not included in the set due to his dislike towards Stone's take on the script which is criticised for removing much of the satirical elements of Tarantino's original story. With True Romance, Tarantino's attitude is different with the director approving of Tony Scott's take on the film with much of the original screenplay intact, something which is clearly evident throughout the film and something that makes it as good as it is. With the screenplay so good I honestly believe that with Tarantino also behind this camera then this film may now viewed at the same level of his most famous film  Pulp Fiction. The film has all the elements of a typical Tarantino film with the same fast-paced and enjoyable formula that we expect from the director, the film is filled with fantastic and memorable references, pop culture references and references to plenty of other films  the Vietnam and Oscar awards conversation where Tarantino pays homage to some of his personal favourite films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Rio Bravo. The biggest film inspiration evident is Terrence Malick's classic Badlands, a clear influence on both of Tarantino's romantic screenplays. This inspiration is portrayed clearly in the film with the same charming yet haunting sounds of Carl Orff that were used in Badlands used in Hans Zimmer's score, with the voice-over from the film's female protagonist Alabama sounding almost identical to that of Sissy Spacek's character Holly in Badlands. The film has perhaps one of my favourite casts of all time with a fantastic ensemble of great actors including a few that would later go on to appear in the films of Tarantino such as Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

    Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception! I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too! One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has "Clarence", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather "Alabama" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says "I'm the Anti-Christ" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called "Mentor" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it! People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme

    True Romance is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by a better director Tony Scott. It's a action/romance film about film geek and a callgirl who steal coke from the mob and get away with it. I'm not a huge Tarantino fan and this film encompass the best and worst of the guy. I don't like dialog that's 90% movie references and direct quotes from other sources. Thankfully, in True Romance this wasn't that much of an issue and it worked well in the films favor. With with exceptions, it felt something like a real movie not a collage of ideas taken from other sources. This why Tarantino's scripts should be directed by other directors to reign in the fanboy nature of his works. And when this happens the film never runs longer than two hours, the pacing is great and it doesn't feel as self-indulgent as his other works. My only other problem with the film where the two lovebirds played by Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater. When compared to the rest of the cast, their performances paled in comparison. Aside from those minor inconveniences, True Romance has a great ensemble cast, great dialog, some really intense scenes and it's just fun. Liked it quite a bit but don't love it...

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.

    The first thing I did after my 'Tarantino XX' Blu-Ray set arrived was watch True Romance, the only film included that I had not previously seen, along with Death Proof which I shall be watching soon. What is interesting about its inclusion in the set is the fact that it is the only film included that is not directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is well known that Tarantino wrote two screenplays based on romantic duos: True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He sold the latter (which I have not seen) to Oliver Stone however that is not included in the set due to his dislike towards Stone's take on the script which is criticised for removing much of the satirical elements of Tarantino's original story. With True Romance, Tarantino's attitude is different with the director approving of Tony Scott's take on the film with much of the original screenplay intact, something which is clearly evident throughout the film and something that makes it as good as it is. With the screenplay so good I honestly believe that with Tarantino also behind this camera then this film may now viewed at the same level of his most famous film  Pulp Fiction. The film has all the elements of a typical Tarantino film with the same fast-paced and enjoyable formula that we expect from the director, the film is filled with fantastic and memorable references, pop culture references and references to plenty of other films  the Vietnam and Oscar awards conversation where Tarantino pays homage to some of his personal favourite films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Rio Bravo. The biggest film inspiration evident is Terrence Malick's classic Badlands, a clear influence on both of Tarantino's romantic screenplays. This inspiration is portrayed clearly in the film with the same charming yet haunting sounds of Carl Orff that were used in Badlands used in Hans Zimmer's score, with the voice-over from the film's female protagonist Alabama sounding almost identical to that of Sissy Spacek's character Holly in Badlands. The film has perhaps one of my favourite casts of all time with a fantastic ensemble of great actors including a few that would later go on to appear in the films of Tarantino such as Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

    Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception! I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too! One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has "Clarence", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather "Alabama" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says "I'm the Anti-Christ" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called "Mentor" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it! People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme

    True Romance is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by a better director Tony Scott. It's a action/romance film about film geek and a callgirl who steal coke from the mob and get away with it. I'm not a huge Tarantino fan and this film encompass the best and worst of the guy. I don't like dialog that's 90% movie references and direct quotes from other sources. Thankfully, in True Romance this wasn't that much of an issue and it worked well in the films favor. With with exceptions, it felt something like a real movie not a collage of ideas taken from other sources. This why Tarantino's scripts should be directed by other directors to reign in the fanboy nature of his works. And when this happens the film never runs longer than two hours, the pacing is great and it doesn't feel as self-indulgent as his other works. My only other problem with the film where the two lovebirds played by Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater. When compared to the rest of the cast, their performances paled in comparison. Aside from those minor inconveniences, True Romance has a great ensemble cast, great dialog, some really intense scenes and it's just fun. Liked it quite a bit but don't love it...

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

    Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception! I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too! One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has "Clarence", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather "Alabama" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says "I'm the Anti-Christ" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called "Mentor" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it! People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme

    True Romance is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by a better director Tony Scott. It's a action/romance film about film geek and a callgirl who steal coke from the mob and get away with it. I'm not a huge Tarantino fan and this film encompass the best and worst of the guy. I don't like dialog that's 90% movie references and direct quotes from other sources. Thankfully, in True Romance this wasn't that much of an issue and it worked well in the films favor. With with exceptions, it felt something like a real movie not a collage of ideas taken from other sources. This why Tarantino's scripts should be directed by other directors to reign in the fanboy nature of his works. And when this happens the film never runs longer than two hours, the pacing is great and it doesn't feel as self-indulgent as his other works. My only other problem with the film where the two lovebirds played by Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater. When compared to the rest of the cast, their performances paled in comparison. Aside from those minor inconveniences, True Romance has a great ensemble cast, great dialog, some really intense scenes and it's just fun. Liked it quite a bit but don't love it...

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.

    The first thing I did after my 'Tarantino XX' Blu-Ray set arrived was watch True Romance, the only film included that I had not previously seen, along with Death Proof which I shall be watching soon. What is interesting about its inclusion in the set is the fact that it is the only film included that is not directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is well known that Tarantino wrote two screenplays based on romantic duos: True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He sold the latter (which I have not seen) to Oliver Stone however that is not included in the set due to his dislike towards Stone's take on the script which is criticised for removing much of the satirical elements of Tarantino's original story. With True Romance, Tarantino's attitude is different with the director approving of Tony Scott's take on the film with much of the original screenplay intact, something which is clearly evident throughout the film and something that makes it as good as it is. With the screenplay so good I honestly believe that with Tarantino also behind this camera then this film may now viewed at the same level of his most famous film  Pulp Fiction. The film has all the elements of a typical Tarantino film with the same fast-paced and enjoyable formula that we expect from the director, the film is filled with fantastic and memorable references, pop culture references and references to plenty of other films  the Vietnam and Oscar awards conversation where Tarantino pays homage to some of his personal favourite films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Rio Bravo. The biggest film inspiration evident is Terrence Malick's classic Badlands, a clear influence on both of Tarantino's romantic screenplays. This inspiration is portrayed clearly in the film with the same charming yet haunting sounds of Carl Orff that were used in Badlands used in Hans Zimmer's score, with the voice-over from the film's female protagonist Alabama sounding almost identical to that of Sissy Spacek's character Holly in Badlands. The film has perhaps one of my favourite casts of all time with a fantastic ensemble of great actors including a few that would later go on to appear in the films of Tarantino such as Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it!

    True Romance is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by a better director Tony Scott. It's a action/romance film about film geek and a callgirl who steal coke from the mob and get away with it. I'm not a huge Tarantino fan and this film encompass the best and worst of the guy. I don't like dialog that's 90% movie references and direct quotes from other sources. Thankfully, in True Romance this wasn't that much of an issue and it worked well in the films favor. With with exceptions, it felt something like a real movie not a collage of ideas taken from other sources. This why Tarantino's scripts should be directed by other directors to reign in the fanboy nature of his works. And when this happens the film never runs longer than two hours, the pacing is great and it doesn't feel as self-indulgent as his other works. My only other problem with the film where the two lovebirds played by Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater. When compared to the rest of the cast, their performances paled in comparison. Aside from those minor inconveniences, True Romance has a great ensemble cast, great dialog, some really intense scenes and it's just fun. Liked it quite a bit but don't love it...

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.

    The first thing I did after my 'Tarantino XX' Blu-Ray set arrived was watch True Romance, the only film included that I had not previously seen, along with Death Proof which I shall be watching soon. What is interesting about its inclusion in the set is the fact that it is the only film included that is not directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is well known that Tarantino wrote two screenplays based on romantic duos: True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He sold the latter (which I have not seen) to Oliver Stone however that is not included in the set due to his dislike towards Stone's take on the script which is criticised for removing much of the satirical elements of Tarantino's original story. With True Romance, Tarantino's attitude is different with the director approving of Tony Scott's take on the film with much of the original screenplay intact, something which is clearly evident throughout the film and something that makes it as good as it is. With the screenplay so good I honestly believe that with Tarantino also behind this camera then this film may now viewed at the same level of his most famous film  Pulp Fiction. The film has all the elements of a typical Tarantino film with the same fast-paced and enjoyable formula that we expect from the director, the film is filled with fantastic and memorable references, pop culture references and references to plenty of other films  the Vietnam and Oscar awards conversation where Tarantino pays homage to some of his personal favourite films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Rio Bravo. The biggest film inspiration evident is Terrence Malick's classic Badlands, a clear influence on both of Tarantino's romantic screenplays. This inspiration is portrayed clearly in the film with the same charming yet haunting sounds of Carl Orff that were used in Badlands used in Hans Zimmer's score, with the voice-over from the film's female protagonist Alabama sounding almost identical to that of Sissy Spacek's character Holly in Badlands. The film has perhaps one of my favourite casts of all time with a fantastic ensemble of great actors including a few that would later go on to appear in the films of Tarantino such as Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. Two of my favourites were Dennis Hopper who portrays a 'good guy' in contrast to the last film of his that I saw, Blue Velvet, and James Gandolfini as a member of the criminal gang chasing Clarence and Alabama who have run off with their cocaine, watching his performance it is easy to see how he would later become the star of my all time favourite TV show, The Sopranos. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken create perhaps the film's greatest scene, possibly one of the greatest scenes of all time. Hopper plays the role of Clifford Worley, the father of the on the run Clarence who attempts to protect his son from the ruthless Sicilian mafia member Vincenzo Coccotti with the other members on looking. Then there's another favourite scene of mine, perhaps the most violent of the entire film where we see James Gandolfini's character Virgil confront Patricia Arquette's character Alabama. I actually had to ask my step-dad about an hour in, "have we seen Gary Oldman yet?" wondering whether I had missed him, I was correct in my suspicions as he told me (having previously seen then film and highly recommending it) he was the pimp Drexl. To put it simply, True Romance is two hours of pure popcorn fun, its explosive, fast-paced, filled with memorable dialogue, unique and brilliantly portrayed characters, pop culture and film references, plenty of violence and of course a romantic centre with two characters who we come to love. True Romance has everything you could want from a film and much more. I would say it is definitely one of Tarantino's best films despite him not actually directing it, and I would say that it made for one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences that I can remember.

    Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception! I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too! One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has "Clarence", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather "Alabama" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says "I'm the Anti-Christ" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called "Mentor" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face. The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it! People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme

    True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best. True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence. Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino was a box office failure,ignored by audiences but received rave reviews from critics. But thanks to the worldwide box office and critical success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is a truly Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each character whether in the film for a long or short period of time stay with viewers because Tarantino script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film. The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well. The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott. The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer. In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made. Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.

    Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), True Romance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it. Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another (like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn't the case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crime that's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash. Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generously punctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance's endless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trash slut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end up saying nothing in the least bit worthwhile. I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn't contain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hour running time. From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifies murder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride, the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued by cops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot. Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.

    You when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems. Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good. The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other seen doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness. The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.

    I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art. Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch. There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget. The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.

    True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.
