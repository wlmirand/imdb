 <sinopse>
  Casey Ryback hops on a Colorado to LA train to start a vacation with his niece. Early into the trip, terrorists board the train and use it as a mobile HQ to hijack a top secret destructive US satellite.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Seal Team Commander Casey Ryback has retired from the Navy since the conclusion of the events in the first movie, and is now a chef at the Mile High Cafe in Denver, Colorado. Ryback is taking his niece Sarah Ryback on vacation, to reconnect and commiserate with her after the death of her parents. They board a train traveling westbound through the Rocky Mountains from Denver to LA. With the help of gun-for-hire Marcus Penn a couple dozen of his mercenaries, ex-CIA brain (and mentally unstable) Travis Dane commandeers the train, takes the passengers and crew hostage, and sets up a mobile control center. He hacks into the CIA database and gains control of a Top-Secret defence satellite he designed during his Agency days that has just been deployed. Funded by various foreign interests, he stands to make 1 billion dollars for using the space weapon to blow up the Eastern seaboard by targeting a nuclear reactor housed beneath the Pentagon. Dane taunts the Joint Chiefs in the Pentagon ...

    Big fan of the original, always like a bit of naval action and you felt that Segal finally had found a role that allowed him to exploit his limited acting talents and formidable martial arts expertise and military skills. We would have quite happily have followed Casey Ryback through a series of adventures, hell, even a TV series but unfortunately this film seems to have killed off a possibly enjoyable franchise which is something of a shame. The Good? As with the original the best part of the film is where Ryback finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation and starts to use his knowledge and training to fight back and slowly regain the initiative from the bad guys. Oddly I rather love the scene where he rewires his electronic diary to the train's payphone in order to send for help, he's about more than just blowing things up and killing folks with his bare hands. Eric Borgosian is very good in his role as the malevolent genius and the action sequences stand up extremely well. Segal's reality series Lawman has actually raised my opinion of him a great deal, you see him actually restraining real violent suspects and confronting armed criminals gun in hand so it's very easy to believe he can do the same in fiction. Also nice to see character actor Royce Applegate playing something other than a good-old-boy villain. The Bad? Everett McGill just doesn't cut it as Penn, good actor but just doesn't convince. Now his character is very smart, figuring a great deal of Ryback's moves out but he just lacks the charisma and chemistry of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in the first film. So lame that he has his own glamorous hit-chick, what a clich&eacute;! You also wonder how much the success of the first film depended on a near naked Erika Eliniak jumping out of the cake? A teenage Katherine Hiegl and Sandra Taylor are both gorgeous but neither do anything remotely sexy (there's a great comedy sketch waiting to be written where a boyfriend tells his delighted girlfriend he's rented them a Katherine Hiegl film to watch as part of their romantic evening but rather than the expected romcom it turns out to be Under Siege 2). So an enjoyable film but a missed opportunity.

    This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. I just LOVE this movie and everything about it. In Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, terrorists hijack a passenger train, to set it up as a mobile and undetectable base for Travis Dane to use his high-tech computers to control a government nuclear satellite in hopes of blowing up the Pentagon, and the entire eastern seaboard. Funny, terrorists hijack a train to hijack a satellite. Anyway, all is going well for the terrorists, they have the perfect plan, take over a train, use it to blow up what they want, and then get rid of the evidence by driving in into a gasoline train. But, there's just one problem, and its the cook, Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) who is really an Ex-Navy Seal. And he is a flaw that will epically ruin Dane's plan. Steven Seagal, what a great actor, you can really tell who he is by his tone in this movie, which he's calm, he whispers, it's just great acting, and not just by Steven, ALL the actors in this movie. It's great acting and directing, and I Love the performance. The plot, while having some flaws, they are easily over-looked by the great action and peril going on. This movie was SO good at pulling me into it, I actually forgot I had seen the entire plot of this movie on Wikipedia, I was watching the movie, knowing what was going to happen, and I was STILL in suspense, I Loved the first Under Siege as well, and this movie is absolutely a 10 star movie. No mater what type of genre you are into, see this movie.

    It was a great movie. It was Seagal's best performance in my opinion. Travis Dane did a good job as the villain even though he was not scary, and it's just a great movie. I like the suspense, the action, etc. If Dane was also scarier it would have been even better. But it was still a great movie. I loved it. Also Ryback's niece was gorgeous. I also liked the location, etc. They should do an Under Siege 3. Even though Dane was more evil I found Penn more intimidating. But it was still a great movie. I own it on DVD and I would watch it again and again. Also I like trains and I really liked the fact that it took place on a train. I like trains even better than cars. Great movie.

    In the realm of the action movie this one has to be among the best. Detractors seem to have it in for Steven Seagal and are quick to pile on unnecessarily. A movie can do no more than deliver the goods one is seeking, and this one does it in the best tradition. It has a relentless tone of tension and violence and a plethora of villains led by a sweaty, nerdy, whiny genius who mass murders with a gleam and a vengeance worthy of Fu Manchu or Dr. Doom. This has non-stop carnage and a raw feeling to it all that is both unpleasant and over the top comic-book like extreme. Casey Ryback is more like a Superhero in this one doing death defying feats and uncanny rescues. Nothing here is real it just feels that way. The martial arts fights are some of Seagal's best and it is doubtful a more intense train wreck was ever put on film. This is an adrenaline movie with one rush after another. A money's worth of entertainment that holds up among its peers as pure, penetrating, and powerful. It is searing cinema and never lets up for a minute delivering one thrill after another. If you can't find an Action Flick fix here, you are without Jones.

    In terms of action film sequels, I thought this was superior to "Die Hard 2" or "Rambo First Blood Part 2", the enigmatic Seagal once again under siege from terrorists, this time, Eric Bogosian and his hired gun Everett McGill aboard a train. Bogosian has hijacked a nuclear satellite via his laptop and is training it on multiple targets around the globe with the intention of setting off a chain reaction that will either destroy the world or deliver him a king's ransom for withholding the threat. Morris Chestnut plays an unlikely purser enlisted by Seagal to help subdue the threat, future star Katherine Heigl plays Seagal's daughter whose aboard the ride into hell, and among a substantial supporting cast are Royce D.Applegate as Seagal's trusted chef, Nick Mancuso as the chain-smoking Pentagon official reprising his role, Dale Dye, Kurtwood Smith and Phyllis Davis in minor roles. The usual array of flashy stunts, knife-work and hand-to-hand combat scenes do the business, with Everett McGill a very capable adversary to the one-man wrecking ball Seagal, who again manages to suppress his uber-cool so as not to become a self parody. Logic might dictate it easy to dismiss these sequels, and the fact there hasn't (yet) been a second sequel might suggest otherwise, but it's worth a viewing.

    This sequel sees Navy seal/chef Casey Ryback taking a train journey through the Rockies with his niece Sarah... needless to say the journey does not go as smoothly as planned. The US Military has just launched a top secret satellite based weapon known as Grazer One; it was designed by Travis Dane who everybody believes killed himself after he was fired. In reality Dane is very much alive and intent on getting control of Grazer One and using it to get his revenge and get rich in the process. To do this he hijacks Ryback's train because the two people with the access codes are also aboard. Once he has control of the train and the Satellite he gives a demonstration of its power by destroying a chemical weapons facility in China. Ryback, who has been separated from his niece, teams up with the porter to take on the bad guys to save his niece and prevent the destruction of Washington DC. This isn't a bad action film but people expecting it to be anywhere near as good as Ryback's first outing will be sorely disappointed... a train just isn't as good a setting as a battleship for starters and the lack of A-list bad guys shows. Steven Seagal puts in a decent performance as Ryback; he might not do emotion but he knows how to do action and that is the main reason to watch his films! Katherine Heigl is good but very underused as his niece; she would have been a much better sidekick than Morris Chestnut's character... he didn't do a bad job it's just that 'comedy sidekicks' are almost always more annoying than they are amusing. Everett McGill wasn't bad as mercenary leader Marcus Penn but the main villain Travis Dane; played by Eric Bogosian was just too over the top to take seriously. The plot was okay even if the weapon was just a bit too sci-fi for my liking. The main reason to watch films like this is to see lots of action and in this department it does deliver with lots of shooting, explosions, knife-fights and martial arts. It also managed to dodge one or two action movie clich&eacute;s... I was certain that the female terrorist was there to have a climactic fight with Ryback's niece but as it turned out she didn't get involved much despite us being told early on that he'd taught her how to fight. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want to watch some good mindless action... good enough that I'm surprised Ryback didn't appear in future films.

    "Under Siege" is by far Steven Seagal's best movie. It pretty much contains everything you could wish for in a Seagal film and more: bone-breaking action, convincing special effects, a tremendous pace, entertaining actors (Gary Busey! Tommy Lee Jones! That chick from "Baywatch"!) and for once even a villain that actually puts up a fight. The loosely related "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" manages to keep some of those good points, but totally misfires on others. Seagal gets to kill a lot of people in this one and occasionally does so in pretty creative ways, but his invincibility just gets tiresome here. The main antagonist can drink pepper spray, but he can't even get a single shot in? Please. The computer genius henchman (or maybe he's the main baddie, the hierarchy is sorta vague) is even worse, badly played and not nearly as interesting as the makers think he is. The movie also seems to go on for too long, the writers constantly have to add additional hijinks because otherwise the plot would be resolved in about half an hour. Pretty much everything Morris Chestnut gets to say or do is padding, which is sort of a shame given that he's pretty much the best actor in the cast. I think he's supposed to be comic relief, but who can even tell with this kind of writing? "Under Siege 2" isn't very bad, but it can't hold a candle to its "predecessor".

    Seagal returns as Casey Ryback, SEAL turned cook. Oddly enough, apart from the same character, there is almost no mention of the first film, there's none of Die Hard 2's 'How can the same stuff happen to the same guy twice?' going on here. But instead of a battleship being seized by hostages it is a train, as the poster above makes plain as day. This time, instead of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey crazy-ing it up as the villains, you have a computer hacker and his mercenaries using the train to take control of an awesome weapons satellite. I'm not going to give a spoiler alert warning this time because if you're worried about me spoiling the 'plot' of this film, you're watching the wrong film. So whilst the set up is similar (mode of transport aside), we have added into the mix Ryback's niece, played by Katherine Heigl. Whilst she is not given much to do, Heigl does stand out as one of the better performers in this film. The villains (as I said earlier) pale in comparison with the baddies of the first film and there is none of the menace or cunning. Instead you have the writers stretching the bounds of plausibility to stretch Seagal's game of hide-and-seek over nearly 100 minutes. Needless to say, this is one of the worst film I've seen in a long, long time. It is so bad it is hilarious. Some of the particulars of the plot caused me to break out into rich peals of laughter like the merry bell I am. One particular line 'Oh my god! An earthquake....in midair.' (DURRRRRRR!) was a standout as was the delaying of the terrorist's plans as an investment banker wants to pay $110 million dollars to explode an airliner carrying his ex-wife. It is baffling! Amusing but baffling, no one told me this film was a comedy.

    Steven Seagal is one of those people I have a real chip on my shoulder about. He is the epitome of the monotone stuntman made into a leading man, replacing charisma and genuine acting with chop-socky action and the same tired plot over and over again. Like a fat Chuck Norris, Seagal's only real gem was the enjoyably trashy "Under Siege" and it came as no surprise that Seagal returned to the formula a few short years later. Trouble is, can lightning really strike twice or was the first one a mere fluke? Seagal once again plays Casey Rybeck, a former Navy SEAL now working as a chef. After his brother is killed in a plane crash, Rybeck takes a cross-country train with his niece Sarah (a young Katherine Heigl) but disaster strikes during the journey. A bunch of terrorists take control of the train and passengers, using it as a base for deranged scientist Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) to take control of a top secret weapons satellite. But Rybeck manages to evade capture and working alongside porter Bobby (Morris Chestnut), begins to take the fight to the terrorists. Seagal films, almost by definition, aren't going to be classics so bear that in mind. Having that said, "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" isn't anything like as bad as other efforts like "Hard To Kill". It's almost embarrassingly dumb and stupid but in spite of its faults, I still enjoyed myself. Seagal doesn't even try to act - his emotional state remains the same in every scene, regardless of what's happening in it - and Heigl does OK as the damsel in distress but Bogosian is a wild-eyed psycho and in that respect, the perfect foil for the pony-tailed punchbag. Plot-wise, this is much more stupid than its predecessor - the utter annihilation of a city in China halfway through is forgotten about by the time Seagal begins his martial arts mission and naturally, the principal terrorist (Everett McGill) just happens to have been taught by Rybeck at Navy SEAL school (or whatever!). Nonsense, of course but still enjoyable nonsense. The only real downside to this is that it isn't as good as "Under Siege" and seeing as Seagal films can only compete with other Seagal films, this makes "Under Siege 2" the second best action film there is. In the greater scheme of things, this is decidedly average at best but at least it isn't as bad as almost any other Seagal film I could mention. It's stupid but stupidly entertaining, assuming you can forgive its faults and just switch your brain off for this one. It might not be big or clever but at least it's mildly diverting.

    All right, guys. Let's admit it. This one is a classic. Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films I'm eternally thankful. I still can't change the channel every time this one comes on. C'mon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. What's not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like "Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you" I'm surprised this thing didn't win the Oscar for best script...lol. But seriously, with so much testosterone flying around, helped by Basil Poledouris's rousing score, and so much cool train climbing action (over, under, all over) I sometimes wonder if this one isn't even better than the first one - helmed by Andrew Davis. I mean the Eric Bogosian/Everett McGill combo is just as good as the Tommy Lee Jones/Gary Busey combo! And the kill quip by Seagal (after he dispatches McGill) "Nobody beats me in the kitchen" is right up there with some of the best quips in the Bond pictures. Anyway it's one of the top films of 1995. I have come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong when using the DIE HARD formula. I have yet to see a bad DIE HARD clone. SPEED, CLIFFHANGER, UNDER SIEGE, SUDDEN DEATH, AIR FORCE ONE, CON AIR, etc. Die Hard on a Bus, Die Hard on a Mountain, Die Hard on a Ship/Train, Die Hard in a Hockey Arena, Die Hard on a Plane, etc.

This isn't a bad action film but people expecting it to be anywhere near as good as Ryback's first outing will be sorely disappointed... a train just isn't as good a setting as a battleship for starters and the lack of A-list bad guys shows. Steven Seagal puts in a decent performance as Ryback; he might not do emotion but he knows how to do action and that is the main reason to watch his films! Katherine Heigl is good but very underused as his niece; she would have been a much better sidekick than Morris Chestnut's character... he didn't do a bad job it's just that 'comedy sidekicks' are almost always more annoying than they are amusing. Everett McGill wasn't bad as mercenary leader Marcus Penn but the main villain Travis Dane; played by Eric Bogosian was just too over the top to take seriously. The plot was okay even if the weapon was just a bit too sci-fi for my liking. The main reason to watch films like this is to see lots of action and in this department it does deliver with lots of shooting, explosions, knife-fights and martial arts. It also managed to dodge one or two action movie clich&eacute;s... I was certain that the female terrorist was there to have a climactic fight with Ryback's niece but as it turned out she didn't get involved much despite us being told early on that he'd taught her how to fight. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want to watch some good mindless action... good enough that I'm surprised Ryback didn't appear in future films.

    "Under Siege" is by far Steven Seagal's best movie. It pretty much contains everything you could wish for in a Seagal film and more: bone-breaking action, convincing special effects, a tremendous pace, entertaining actors (Gary Busey! Tommy Lee Jones! That chick from "Baywatch"!) and for once even a villain that actually puts up a fight. The loosely related "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" manages to keep some of those good points, but totally misfires on others. Seagal gets to kill a lot of people in this one and occasionally does so in pretty creative ways, but his invincibility just gets tiresome here. The main antagonist can drink pepper spray, but he can't even get a single shot in? Please. The computer genius henchman (or maybe he's the main baddie, the hierarchy is sorta vague) is even worse, badly played and not nearly as interesting as the makers think he is. The movie also seems to go on for too long, the writers constantly have to add additional hijinks because otherwise the plot would be resolved in about half an hour. Pretty much everything Morris Chestnut gets to say or do is padding, which is sort of a shame given that he's pretty much the best actor in the cast. I think he's supposed to be comic relief, but who can even tell with this kind of writing? "Under Siege 2" isn't very bad, but it can't hold a candle to its "predecessor".

    Seagal returns as Casey Ryback, SEAL turned cook. Oddly enough, apart from the same character, there is almost no mention of the first film, there's none of Die Hard 2's 'How can the same stuff happen to the same guy twice?' going on here. But instead of a battleship being seized by hostages it is a train, as the poster above makes plain as day. This time, instead of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey crazy-ing it up as the villains, you have a computer hacker and his mercenaries using the train to take control of an awesome weapons satellite. I'm not going to give a spoiler alert warning this time because if you're worried about me spoiling the 'plot' of this film, you're watching the wrong film. So whilst the set up is similar (mode of transport aside), we have added into the mix Ryback's niece, played by Katherine Heigl. Whilst she is not given much to do, Heigl does stand out as one of the better performers in this film. The villains (as I said earlier) pale in comparison with the baddies of the first film and there is none of the menace or cunning. Instead you have the writers stretching the bounds of plausibility to stretch Seagal's game of hide-and-seek over nearly 100 minutes. Needless to say, this is one of the worst film I've seen in a long, long time. It is so bad it is hilarious. Some of the particulars of the plot caused me to break out into rich peals of laughter like the merry bell I am. One particular line 'Oh my god! An earthquake....in midair.' (DURRRRRRR!) was a standout as was the delaying of the terrorist's plans as an investment banker wants to pay $110 million dollars to explode an airliner carrying his ex-wife. It is baffling! Amusing but baffling, no one told me this film was a comedy.

    Steven Seagal is one of those people I have a real chip on my shoulder about. He is the epitome of the monotone stuntman made into a leading man, replacing charisma and genuine acting with chop-socky action and the same tired plot over and over again. Like a fat Chuck Norris, Seagal's only real gem was the enjoyably trashy "Under Siege" and it came as no surprise that Seagal returned to the formula a few short years later. Trouble is, can lightning really strike twice or was the first one a mere fluke? Seagal once again plays Casey Rybeck, a former Navy SEAL now working as a chef. After his brother is killed in a plane crash, Rybeck takes a cross-country train with his niece Sarah (a young Katherine Heigl) but disaster strikes during the journey. A bunch of terrorists take control of the train and passengers, using it as a base for deranged scientist Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) to take control of a top secret weapons satellite. But Rybeck manages to evade capture and working alongside porter Bobby (Morris Chestnut), begins to take the fight to the terrorists. Seagal films, almost by definition, aren't going to be classics so bear that in mind. Having that said, "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" isn't anything like as bad as other efforts like "Hard To Kill". It's almost embarrassingly dumb and stupid but in spite of its faults, I still enjoyed myself. Seagal doesn't even try to act - his emotional state remains the same in every scene, regardless of what's happening in it - and Heigl does OK as the damsel in distress but Bogosian is a wild-eyed psycho and in that respect, the perfect foil for the pony-tailed punchbag. Plot-wise, this is much more stupid than its predecessor - the utter annihilation of a city in China halfway through is forgotten about by the time Seagal begins his martial arts mission and naturally, the principal terrorist (Everett McGill) just happens to have been taught by Rybeck at Navy SEAL school (or whatever!). Nonsense, of course but still enjoyable nonsense. The only real downside to this is that it isn't as good as "Under Siege" and seeing as Seagal films can only compete with other Seagal films, this makes "Under Siege 2" the second best action film there is. In the greater scheme of things, this is decidedly average at best but at least it isn't as bad as almost any other Seagal film I could mention. It's stupid but stupidly entertaining, assuming you can forgive its faults and just switch your brain off for this one. It might not be big or clever but at least it's mildly diverting.

    All right, guys. Let's admit it. This one is a classic. Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films I'm eternally thankful. I still can't change the channel every time this one comes on. C'mon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. What's not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like "Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you" I'm surprised this thing didn't win the Oscar for best script...lol. But seriously, with so much testosterone flying around, helped by Basil Poledouris's rousing score, and so much cool train climbing action (over, under, all over) I sometimes wonder if this one isn't even better than the first one - helmed by Andrew Davis. I mean the Eric Bogosian/Everett McGill combo is just as good as the Tommy Lee Jones/Gary Busey combo! And the kill quip by Seagal (after he dispatches McGill) "Nobody beats me in the kitchen" is right up there with some of the best quips in the Bond pictures. Anyway it's one of the top films of 1995. I have come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong when using the DIE HARD formula. I have yet to see a bad DIE HARD clone. SPEED, CLIFFHANGER, UNDER SIEGE, SUDDEN DEATH, AIR FORCE ONE, CON AIR, etc. Die Hard on a Bus, Die Hard on a Mountain, Die Hard on a Ship/Train, Die Hard in a Hockey Arena, Die Hard on a Plane, etc.

    Big fan of the original, always like a bit of naval action and you felt that Segal finally had found a role that allowed him to exploit his limited acting talents and formidable martial arts expertise and military skills. We would have quite happily have followed Casey Ryback through a series of adventures, hell, even a TV series but unfortunately this film seems to have killed off a possibly enjoyable franchise which is something of a shame. The Good? As with the original the best part of the film is where Ryback finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation and starts to use his knowledge and training to fight back and slowly regain the initiative from the bad guys. Oddly I rather love the scene where he rewires his electronic diary to the train's payphone in order to send for help, he's about more than just blowing things up and killing folks with his bare hands. Eric Borgosian is very good in his role as the malevolent genius and the action sequences stand up extremely well. Segal's reality series Lawman has actually raised my opinion of him a great deal, you see him actually restraining real violent suspects and confronting armed criminals gun in hand so it's very easy to believe he can do the same in fiction. Also nice to see character actor Royce Applegate playing something other than a good-old-boy villain. The Bad? Everett McGill just doesn't cut it as Penn, good actor but just doesn't convince. Now his character is very smart, figuring a great deal of Ryback's moves out but he just lacks the charisma and chemistry of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in the first film. So lame that he has his own glamorous hit-chick, what a clich&eacute;! You also wonder how much the success of the first film depended on a near naked Erika Eliniak jumping out of the cake? A teenage Katherine Hiegl and Sandra Taylor are both gorgeous but neither do anything remotely sexy (there's a great comedy sketch waiting to be written where a boyfriend tells his delighted girlfriend he's rented them a Katherine Hiegl film to watch as part of their romantic evening but rather than the expected romcom it turns out to be Under Siege 2). So an enjoyable film but a missed opportunity.

    This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. I just LOVE this movie and everything about it. In Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, terrorists hijack a passenger train, to set it up as a mobile and undetectable base for Travis Dane to use his high-tech computers to control a government nuclear satellite in hopes of blowing up the Pentagon, and the entire eastern seaboard. Funny, terrorists hijack a train to hijack a satellite. Anyway, all is going well for the terrorists, they have the perfect plan, take over a train, use it to blow up what they want, and then get rid of the evidence by driving in into a gasoline train. But, there's just one problem, and its the cook, Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) who is really an Ex-Navy Seal. And he is a flaw that will epically ruin Dane's plan. Steven Seagal, what a great actor, you can really tell who he is by his tone in this movie, which he's calm, he whispers, it's just great acting, and not just by Steven, ALL the actors in this movie. It's great acting and directing, and I Love the performance. The plot, while having some flaws, they are easily over-looked by the great action and peril going on. This movie was SO good at pulling me into it, I actually forgot I had seen the entire plot of this movie on Wikipedia, I was watching the movie, knowing what was going to happen, and I was STILL in suspense, I Loved the first Under Siege as well, and this movie is absolutely a 10 star movie. No mater what type of genre you are into, see this movie.

    It was a great movie. It was Seagal's best performance in my opinion. Travis Dane did a good job as the villain even though he was not scary, and it's just a great movie. I like the suspense, the action, etc. If Dane was also scarier it would have been even better. But it was still a great movie. I loved it. Also Ryback's niece was gorgeous. I also liked the location, etc. They should do an Under Siege 3. Even though Dane was more evil I found Penn more intimidating. But it was still a great movie. I own it on DVD and I would watch it again and again. Also I like trains and I really liked the fact that it took place on a train. I like trains even better than cars. Great movie.

    In the realm of the action movie this one has to be among the best. Detractors seem to have it in for Steven Seagal and are quick to pile on unnecessarily. A movie can do no more than deliver the goods one is seeking, and this one does it in the best tradition. It has a relentless tone of tension and violence and a plethora of villains led by a sweaty, nerdy, whiny genius who mass murders with a gleam and a vengeance worthy of Fu Manchu or Dr. Doom. This has non-stop carnage and a raw feeling to it all that is both unpleasant and over the top comic-book like extreme. Casey Ryback is more like a Superhero in this one doing death defying feats and uncanny rescues. Nothing here is real it just feels that way. The martial arts fights are some of Seagal's best and it is doubtful a more intense train wreck was ever put on film. This is an adrenaline movie with one rush after another. A money's worth of entertainment that holds up among its peers as pure, penetrating, and powerful. It is searing cinema and never lets up for a minute delivering one thrill after another. If you can't find an Action Flick fix here, you are without Jones.

    In terms of action film sequels, I thought this was superior to "Die Hard 2" or "Rambo First Blood Part 2", the enigmatic Seagal once again under siege from terrorists, this time, Eric Bogosian and his hired gun Everett McGill aboard a train. Bogosian has hijacked a nuclear satellite via his laptop and is training it on multiple targets around the globe with the intention of setting off a chain reaction that will either destroy the world or deliver him a king's ransom for withholding the threat. Morris Chestnut plays an unlikely purser enlisted by Seagal to help subdue the threat, future star Katherine Heigl plays Seagal's daughter whose aboard the ride into hell, and among a substantial supporting cast are Royce D.Applegate as Seagal's trusted chef, Nick Mancuso as the chain-smoking Pentagon official reprising his role, Dale Dye, Kurtwood Smith and Phyllis Davis in minor roles. The usual array of flashy stunts, knife-work and hand-to-hand combat scenes do the business, with Everett McGill a very capable adversary to the one-man wrecking ball Seagal, who again manages to suppress his uber-cool so as not to become a self parody. Logic might dictate it easy to dismiss these sequels, and the fact there hasn't (yet) been a second sequel might suggest otherwise, but it's worth a viewing.

    This sequel sees Navy seal/chef Casey Ryback taking a train journey through the Rockies with his niece Sarah... needless to say the journey does not go as smoothly as planned. The US Military has just launched a top secret satellite based weapon known as Grazer One; it was designed by Travis Dane who everybody believes killed himself after he was fired. In reality Dane is very much alive and intent on getting control of Grazer One and using it to get his revenge and get rich in the process. To do this he hijacks Ryback's train because the two people with the access codes are also aboard. Once he has control of the train and the Satellite he gives a demonstration of its power by destroying a chemical weapons facility in China. Ryback, who has been separated from his niece, teams up with the porter to take on the bad guys to save his niece and prevent the destruction of Washington DC. This isn't a bad action film but people expecting it to be anywhere near as good as Ryback's first outing will be sorely disappointed... a train just isn't as good a setting as a battleship for starters and the lack of A-list bad guys shows. Steven Seagal puts in a decent performance as Ryback; he might not do emotion but he knows how to do action and that is the main reason to watch his films!

It pretty much contains everything you could wish for in a Seagal film and more: bone-breaking action, convincing special effects, a tremendous pace, entertaining actors (Gary Busey! Tommy Lee Jones!

So lame that he has his own glamorous hit-chick, what a clich&eacute;! You also wonder how much the success of the first film depended on a near naked Erika Eliniak jumping out of the cake? A teenage Katherine Hiegl and Sandra Taylor are both gorgeous but neither do anything remotely sexy (there's a great comedy sketch waiting to be written where a boyfriend tells his delighted girlfriend he's rented them a Katherine Hiegl film to watch as part of their romantic evening but rather than the expected romcom it turns out to be Under Siege 2). So an enjoyable film but a missed opportunity.

    This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. I just LOVE this movie and everything about it. In Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, terrorists hijack a passenger train, to set it up as a mobile and undetectable base for Travis Dane to use his high-tech computers to control a government nuclear satellite in hopes of blowing up the Pentagon, and the entire eastern seaboard. Funny, terrorists hijack a train to hijack a satellite. Anyway, all is going well for the terrorists, they have the perfect plan, take over a train, use it to blow up what they want, and then get rid of the evidence by driving in into a gasoline train. But, there's just one problem, and its the cook, Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) who is really an Ex-Navy Seal. And he is a flaw that will epically ruin Dane's plan. Steven Seagal, what a great actor, you can really tell who he is by his tone in this movie, which he's calm, he whispers, it's just great acting, and not just by Steven, ALL the actors in this movie. It's great acting and directing, and I Love the performance. The plot, while having some flaws, they are easily over-looked by the great action and peril going on. This movie was SO good at pulling me into it, I actually forgot I had seen the entire plot of this movie on Wikipedia, I was watching the movie, knowing what was going to happen, and I was STILL in suspense, I Loved the first Under Siege as well, and this movie is absolutely a 10 star movie. No mater what type of genre you are into, see this movie.

    It was a great movie. It was Seagal's best performance in my opinion. Travis Dane did a good job as the villain even though he was not scary, and it's just a great movie. I like the suspense, the action, etc. If Dane was also scarier it would have been even better. But it was still a great movie. I loved it. Also Ryback's niece was gorgeous. I also liked the location, etc. They should do an Under Siege 3. Even though Dane was more evil I found Penn more intimidating. But it was still a great movie. I own it on DVD and I would watch it again and again. Also I like trains and I really liked the fact that it took place on a train. I like trains even better than cars. Great movie.

    In the realm of the action movie this one has to be among the best. Detractors seem to have it in for Steven Seagal and are quick to pile on unnecessarily. A movie can do no more than deliver the goods one is seeking, and this one does it in the best tradition. It has a relentless tone of tension and violence and a plethora of villains led by a sweaty, nerdy, whiny genius who mass murders with a gleam and a vengeance worthy of Fu Manchu or Dr. Doom. This has non-stop carnage and a raw feeling to it all that is both unpleasant and over the top comic-book like extreme. Casey Ryback is more like a Superhero in this one doing death defying feats and uncanny rescues. Nothing here is real it just feels that way. The martial arts fights are some of Seagal's best and it is doubtful a more intense train wreck was ever put on film. This is an adrenaline movie with one rush after another. A money's worth of entertainment that holds up among its peers as pure, penetrating, and powerful. It is searing cinema and never lets up for a minute delivering one thrill after another. If you can't find an Action Flick fix here, you are without Jones.

    In terms of action film sequels, I thought this was superior to "Die Hard 2" or "Rambo First Blood Part 2", the enigmatic Seagal once again under siege from terrorists, this time, Eric Bogosian and his hired gun Everett McGill aboard a train. Bogosian has hijacked a nuclear satellite via his laptop and is training it on multiple targets around the globe with the intention of setting off a chain reaction that will either destroy the world or deliver him a king's ransom for withholding the threat. Morris Chestnut plays an unlikely purser enlisted by Seagal to help subdue the threat, future star Katherine Heigl plays Seagal's daughter whose aboard the ride into hell, and among a substantial supporting cast are Royce D.Applegate as Seagal's trusted chef, Nick Mancuso as the chain-smoking Pentagon official reprising his role, Dale Dye, Kurtwood Smith and Phyllis Davis in minor roles. The usual array of flashy stunts, knife-work and hand-to-hand combat scenes do the business, with Everett McGill a very capable adversary to the one-man wrecking ball Seagal, who again manages to suppress his uber-cool so as not to become a self parody. Logic might dictate it easy to dismiss these sequels, and the fact there hasn't (yet) been a second sequel might suggest otherwise, but it's worth a viewing.

    This sequel sees Navy seal/chef Casey Ryback taking a train journey through the Rockies with his niece Sarah... needless to say the journey does not go as smoothly as planned. The US Military has just launched a top secret satellite based weapon known as Grazer One; it was designed by Travis Dane who everybody believes killed himself after he was fired. In reality Dane is very much alive and intent on getting control of Grazer One and using it to get his revenge and get rich in the process. To do this he hijacks Ryback's train because the two people with the access codes are also aboard. Once he has control of the train and the Satellite he gives a demonstration of its power by destroying a chemical weapons facility in China. Ryback, who has been separated from his niece, teams up with the porter to take on the bad guys to save his niece and prevent the destruction of Washington DC. This isn't a bad action film but people expecting it to be anywhere near as good as Ryback's first outing will be sorely disappointed... a train just isn't as good a setting as a battleship for starters and the lack of A-list bad guys shows. Steven Seagal puts in a decent performance as Ryback; he might not do emotion but he knows how to do action and that is the main reason to watch his films! Katherine Heigl is good but very underused as his niece; she would have been a much better sidekick than Morris Chestnut's character... he didn't do a bad job it's just that 'comedy sidekicks' are almost always more annoying than they are amusing. Everett McGill wasn't bad as mercenary leader Marcus Penn but the main villain Travis Dane; played by Eric Bogosian was just too over the top to take seriously. The plot was okay even if the weapon was just a bit too sci-fi for my liking. The main reason to watch films like this is to see lots of action and in this department it does deliver with lots of shooting, explosions, knife-fights and martial arts. It also managed to dodge one or two action movie clich&eacute;s... I was certain that the female terrorist was there to have a climactic fight with Ryback's niece but as it turned out she didn't get involved much despite us being told early on that he'd taught her how to fight. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want to watch some good mindless action... good enough that I'm surprised Ryback didn't appear in future films.

    "Under Siege" is by far Steven Seagal's best movie. It pretty much contains everything you could wish for in a Seagal film and more: bone-breaking action, convincing special effects, a tremendous pace, entertaining actors (Gary Busey! Tommy Lee Jones! That chick from "Baywatch"!) and for once even a villain that actually puts up a fight. The loosely related "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" manages to keep some of those good points, but totally misfires on others. Seagal gets to kill a lot of people in this one and occasionally does so in pretty creative ways, but his invincibility just gets tiresome here. The main antagonist can drink pepper spray, but he can't even get a single shot in? Please. The computer genius henchman (or maybe he's the main baddie, the hierarchy is sorta vague) is even worse, badly played and not nearly as interesting as the makers think he is. The movie also seems to go on for too long, the writers constantly have to add additional hijinks because otherwise the plot would be resolved in about half an hour. Pretty much everything Morris Chestnut gets to say or do is padding, which is sort of a shame given that he's pretty much the best actor in the cast. I think he's supposed to be comic relief, but who can even tell with this kind of writing? "Under Siege 2" isn't very bad, but it can't hold a candle to its "predecessor".

    Seagal returns as Casey Ryback, SEAL turned cook. Oddly enough, apart from the same character, there is almost no mention of the first film, there's none of Die Hard 2's 'How can the same stuff happen to the same guy twice?' going on here. But instead of a battleship being seized by hostages it is a train, as the poster above makes plain as day. This time, instead of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey crazy-ing it up as the villains, you have a computer hacker and his mercenaries using the train to take control of an awesome weapons satellite. I'm not going to give a spoiler alert warning this time because if you're worried about me spoiling the 'plot' of this film, you're watching the wrong film. So whilst the set up is similar (mode of transport aside), we have added into the mix Ryback's niece, played by Katherine Heigl. Whilst she is not given much to do, Heigl does stand out as one of the better performers in this film. The villains (as I said earlier) pale in comparison with the baddies of the first film and there is none of the menace or cunning. Instead you have the writers stretching the bounds of plausibility to stretch Seagal's game of hide-and-seek over nearly 100 minutes. Needless to say, this is one of the worst film I've seen in a long, long time. It is so bad it is hilarious. Some of the particulars of the plot caused me to break out into rich peals of laughter like the merry bell I am. One particular line 'Oh my god! An earthquake....in midair.' (DURRRRRRR!) was a standout as was the delaying of the terrorist's plans as an investment banker wants to pay $110 million dollars to explode an airliner carrying his ex-wife. It is baffling! Amusing but baffling, no one told me this film was a comedy.

    Steven Seagal is one of those people I have a real chip on my shoulder about. He is the epitome of the monotone stuntman made into a leading man, replacing charisma and genuine acting with chop-socky action and the same tired plot over and over again. Like a fat Chuck Norris, Seagal's only real gem was the enjoyably trashy "Under Siege" and it came as no surprise that Seagal returned to the formula a few short years later. Trouble is, can lightning really strike twice or was the first one a mere fluke? Seagal once again plays Casey Rybeck, a former Navy SEAL now working as a chef. After his brother is killed in a plane crash, Rybeck takes a cross-country train with his niece Sarah (a young Katherine Heigl) but disaster strikes during the journey. A bunch of terrorists take control of the train and passengers, using it as a base for deranged scientist Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) to take control of a top secret weapons satellite. But Rybeck manages to evade capture and working alongside porter Bobby (Morris Chestnut), begins to take the fight to the terrorists. Seagal films, almost by definition, aren't going to be classics so bear that in mind. Having that said, "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" isn't anything like as bad as other efforts like "Hard To Kill". It's almost embarrassingly dumb and stupid but in spite of its faults, I still enjoyed myself. Seagal doesn't even try to act - his emotional state remains the same in every scene, regardless of what's happening in it - and Heigl does OK as the damsel in distress but Bogosian is a wild-eyed psycho and in that respect, the perfect foil for the pony-tailed punchbag. Plot-wise, this is much more stupid than its predecessor - the utter annihilation of a city in China halfway through is forgotten about by the time Seagal begins his martial arts mission and naturally, the principal terrorist (Everett McGill) just happens to have been taught by Rybeck at Navy SEAL school (or whatever!). Nonsense, of course but still enjoyable nonsense. The only real downside to this is that it isn't as good as "Under Siege" and seeing as Seagal films can only compete with other Seagal films, this makes "Under Siege 2" the second best action film there is. In the greater scheme of things, this is decidedly average at best but at least it isn't as bad as almost any other Seagal film I could mention. It's stupid but stupidly entertaining, assuming you can forgive its faults and just switch your brain off for this one. It might not be big or clever but at least it's mildly diverting.

    All right, guys. Let's admit it. This one is a classic. Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films I'm eternally thankful. I still can't change the channel every time this one comes on. C'mon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. What's not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like "Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you" I'm surprised this thing didn't win the Oscar for best script...lol. But seriously, with so much testosterone flying around, helped by Basil Poledouris's rousing score, and so much cool train climbing action (over, under, all over) I sometimes wonder if this one isn't even better than the first one - helmed by Andrew Davis. I mean the Eric Bogosian/Everett McGill combo is just as good as the Tommy Lee Jones/Gary Busey combo! And the kill quip by Seagal (after he dispatches McGill) "Nobody beats me in the kitchen" is right up there with some of the best quips in the Bond pictures. Anyway it's one of the top films of 1995. I have come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong when using the DIE HARD formula. I have yet to see a bad DIE HARD clone. SPEED, CLIFFHANGER, UNDER SIEGE, SUDDEN DEATH, AIR FORCE ONE, CON AIR, etc. Die Hard on a Bus, Die Hard on a Mountain, Die Hard on a Ship/Train, Die Hard in a Hockey Arena, Die Hard on a Plane, etc.

    Big fan of the original, always like a bit of naval action and you felt that Segal finally had found a role that allowed him to exploit his limited acting talents and formidable martial arts expertise and military skills. We would have quite happily have followed Casey Ryback through a series of adventures, hell, even a TV series but unfortunately this film seems to have killed off a possibly enjoyable franchise which is something of a shame. The Good? As with the original the best part of the film is where Ryback finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation and starts to use his knowledge and training to fight back and slowly regain the initiative from the bad guys. Oddly I rather love the scene where he rewires his electronic diary to the train's payphone in order to send for help, he's about more than just blowing things up and killing folks with his bare hands. Eric Borgosian is very good in his role as the malevolent genius and the action sequences stand up extremely well. Segal's reality series Lawman has actually raised my opinion of him a great deal, you see him actually restraining real violent suspects and confronting armed criminals gun in hand so it's very easy to believe he can do the same in fiction. Also nice to see character actor Royce Applegate playing something other than a good-old-boy villain. The Bad? Everett McGill just doesn't cut it as Penn, good actor but just doesn't convince. Now his character is very smart, figuring a great deal of Ryback's moves out but he just lacks the charisma and chemistry of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in the first film. So lame that he has his own glamorous hit-chick, what a clich&eacute;! You also wonder how much the success of the first film depended on a near naked Erika Eliniak jumping out of the cake? A teenage Katherine Hiegl and Sandra Taylor are both gorgeous but neither do anything remotely sexy (there's a great comedy sketch waiting to be written where a boyfriend tells his delighted girlfriend he's rented them a Katherine Hiegl film to watch as part of their romantic evening but rather than the expected romcom it turns out to be Under Siege 2). So an enjoyable film but a missed opportunity.

So whilst the set up is similar (mode of transport aside), we have added into the mix Ryback's niece, played by Katherine Heigl. Whilst she is not given much to do, Heigl does stand out as one of the better performers in this film. The villains (as I said earlier) pale in comparison with the baddies of the first film and there is none of the menace or cunning. Instead you have the writers stretching the bounds of plausibility to stretch Seagal's game of hide-and-seek over nearly 100 minutes. Needless to say, this is one of the worst film I've seen in a long, long time. It is so bad it is hilarious. Some of the particulars of the plot caused me to break out into rich peals of laughter like the merry bell I am. One particular line 'Oh my god! An earthquake....in midair.' (DURRRRRRR!) was a standout as was the delaying of the terrorist's plans as an investment banker wants to pay $110 million dollars to explode an airliner carrying his ex-wife. It is baffling! Amusing but baffling, no one told me this film was a comedy.

    Steven Seagal is one of those people I have a real chip on my shoulder about. He is the epitome of the monotone stuntman made into a leading man, replacing charisma and genuine acting with chop-socky action and the same tired plot over and over again. Like a fat Chuck Norris, Seagal's only real gem was the enjoyably trashy "Under Siege" and it came as no surprise that Seagal returned to the formula a few short years later. Trouble is, can lightning really strike twice or was the first one a mere fluke? Seagal once again plays Casey Rybeck, a former Navy SEAL now working as a chef. After his brother is killed in a plane crash, Rybeck takes a cross-country train with his niece Sarah (a young Katherine Heigl) but disaster strikes during the journey. A bunch of terrorists take control of the train and passengers, using it as a base for deranged scientist Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) to take control of a top secret weapons satellite. But Rybeck manages to evade capture and working alongside porter Bobby (Morris Chestnut), begins to take the fight to the terrorists. Seagal films, almost by definition, aren't going to be classics so bear that in mind. Having that said, "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" isn't anything like as bad as other efforts like "Hard To Kill". It's almost embarrassingly dumb and stupid but in spite of its faults, I still enjoyed myself. Seagal doesn't even try to act - his emotional state remains the same in every scene, regardless of what's happening in it - and Heigl does OK as the damsel in distress but Bogosian is a wild-eyed psycho and in that respect, the perfect foil for the pony-tailed punchbag. Plot-wise, this is much more stupid than its predecessor - the utter annihilation of a city in China halfway through is forgotten about by the time Seagal begins his martial arts mission and naturally, the principal terrorist (Everett McGill) just happens to have been taught by Rybeck at Navy SEAL school (or whatever!). Nonsense, of course but still enjoyable nonsense. The only real downside to this is that it isn't as good as "Under Siege" and seeing as Seagal films can only compete with other Seagal films, this makes "Under Siege 2" the second best action film there is. In the greater scheme of things, this is decidedly average at best but at least it isn't as bad as almost any other Seagal film I could mention. It's stupid but stupidly entertaining, assuming you can forgive its faults and just switch your brain off for this one. It might not be big or clever but at least it's mildly diverting.

    All right, guys. Let's admit it. This one is a classic. Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films I'm eternally thankful. I still can't change the channel every time this one comes on. C'mon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. What's not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like "Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you" I'm surprised this thing didn't win the Oscar for best script...lol. But seriously, with so much testosterone flying around, helped by Basil Poledouris's rousing score, and so much cool train climbing action (over, under, all over) I sometimes wonder if this one isn't even better than the first one - helmed by Andrew Davis. I mean the Eric Bogosian/Everett McGill combo is just as good as the Tommy Lee Jones/Gary Busey combo! And the kill quip by Seagal (after he dispatches McGill) "Nobody beats me in the kitchen" is right up there with some of the best quips in the Bond pictures. Anyway it's one of the top films of 1995. I have come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong when using the DIE HARD formula. I have yet to see a bad DIE HARD clone. SPEED, CLIFFHANGER, UNDER SIEGE, SUDDEN DEATH, AIR FORCE ONE, CON AIR, etc. Die Hard on a Bus, Die Hard on a Mountain, Die Hard on a Ship/Train, Die Hard in a Hockey Arena, Die Hard on a Plane, etc.

    Big fan of the original, always like a bit of naval action and you felt that Segal finally had found a role that allowed him to exploit his limited acting talents and formidable martial arts expertise and military skills. We would have quite happily have followed Casey Ryback through a series of adventures, hell, even a TV series but unfortunately this film seems to have killed off a possibly enjoyable franchise which is something of a shame. The Good? As with the original the best part of the film is where Ryback finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation and starts to use his knowledge and training to fight back and slowly regain the initiative from the bad guys. Oddly I rather love the scene where he rewires his electronic diary to the train's payphone in order to send for help, he's about more than just blowing things up and killing folks with his bare hands. Eric Borgosian is very good in his role as the malevolent genius and the action sequences stand up extremely well. Segal's reality series Lawman has actually raised my opinion of him a great deal, you see him actually restraining real violent suspects and confronting armed criminals gun in hand so it's very easy to believe he can do the same in fiction. Also nice to see character actor Royce Applegate playing something other than a good-old-boy villain. The Bad? Everett McGill just doesn't cut it as Penn, good actor but just doesn't convince. Now his character is very smart, figuring a great deal of Ryback's moves out but he just lacks the charisma and chemistry of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in the first film. So lame that he has his own glamorous hit-chick, what a clich&eacute;! You also wonder how much the success of the first film depended on a near naked Erika Eliniak jumping out of the cake? A teenage Katherine Hiegl and Sandra Taylor are both gorgeous but neither do anything remotely sexy (there's a great comedy sketch waiting to be written where a boyfriend tells his delighted girlfriend he's rented them a Katherine Hiegl film to watch as part of their romantic evening but rather than the expected romcom it turns out to be Under Siege 2). So an enjoyable film but a missed opportunity.

    This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. I just LOVE this movie and everything about it. In Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, terrorists hijack a passenger train, to set it up as a mobile and undetectable base for Travis Dane to use his high-tech computers to control a government nuclear satellite in hopes of blowing up the Pentagon, and the entire eastern seaboard. Funny, terrorists hijack a train to hijack a satellite. Anyway, all is going well for the terrorists, they have the perfect plan, take over a train, use it to blow up what they want, and then get rid of the evidence by driving in into a gasoline train. But, there's just one problem, and its the cook, Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) who is really an Ex-Navy Seal. And he is a flaw that will epically ruin Dane's plan. Steven Seagal, what a great actor, you can really tell who he is by his tone in this movie, which he's calm, he whispers, it's just great acting, and not just by Steven, ALL the actors in this movie. It's great acting and directing, and I Love the performance. The plot, while having some flaws, they are easily over-looked by the great action and peril going on. This movie was SO good at pulling me into it, I actually forgot I had seen the entire plot of this movie on Wikipedia, I was watching the movie, knowing what was going to happen, and I was STILL in suspense, I Loved the first Under Siege as well, and this movie is absolutely a 10 star movie. No mater what type of genre you are into, see this movie.

    It was a great movie. It was Seagal's best performance in my opinion. Travis Dane did a good job as the villain even though he was not scary, and it's just a great movie. I like the suspense, the action, etc. If Dane was also scarier it would have been even better. But it was still a great movie. I loved it. Also Ryback's niece was gorgeous. I also liked the location, etc. They should do an Under Siege 3. Even though Dane was more evil I found Penn more intimidating. But it was still a great movie. I own it on DVD and I would watch it again and again. Also I like trains and I really liked the fact that it took place on a train. I like trains even better than cars. Great movie.

    In the realm of the action movie this one has to be among the best. Detractors seem to have it in for Steven Seagal and are quick to pile on unnecessarily. A movie can do no more than deliver the goods one is seeking, and this one does it in the best tradition. It has a relentless tone of tension and violence and a plethora of villains led by a sweaty, nerdy, whiny genius who mass murders with a gleam and a vengeance worthy of Fu Manchu or Dr. Doom. This has non-stop carnage and a raw feeling to it all that is both unpleasant and over the top comic-book like extreme. Casey Ryback is more like a Superhero in this one doing death defying feats and uncanny rescues. Nothing here is real it just feels that way. The martial arts fights are some of Seagal's best and it is doubtful a more intense train wreck was ever put on film. This is an adrenaline movie with one rush after another. A money's worth of entertainment that holds up among its peers as pure, penetrating, and powerful. It is searing cinema and never lets up for a minute delivering one thrill after another. If you can't find an Action Flick fix here, you are without Jones.

    In terms of action film sequels, I thought this was superior to "Die Hard 2" or "Rambo First Blood Part 2", the enigmatic Seagal once again under siege from terrorists, this time, Eric Bogosian and his hired gun Everett McGill aboard a train. Bogosian has hijacked a nuclear satellite via his laptop and is training it on multiple targets around the globe with the intention of setting off a chain reaction that will either destroy the world or deliver him a king's ransom for withholding the threat. Morris Chestnut plays an unlikely purser enlisted by Seagal to help subdue the threat, future star Katherine Heigl plays Seagal's daughter whose aboard the ride into hell, and among a substantial supporting cast are Royce D.Applegate as Seagal's trusted chef, Nick Mancuso as the chain-smoking Pentagon official reprising his role, Dale Dye, Kurtwood Smith and Phyllis Davis in minor roles. The usual array of flashy stunts, knife-work and hand-to-hand combat scenes do the business, with Everett McGill a very capable adversary to the one-man wrecking ball Seagal, who again manages to suppress his uber-cool so as not to become a self parody. Logic might dictate it easy to dismiss these sequels, and the fact there hasn't (yet) been a second sequel might suggest otherwise, but it's worth a viewing.

    This sequel sees Navy seal/chef Casey Ryback taking a train journey through the Rockies with his niece Sarah... needless to say the journey does not go as smoothly as planned. The US Military has just launched a top secret satellite based weapon known as Grazer One; it was designed by Travis Dane who everybody believes killed himself after he was fired. In reality Dane is very much alive and intent on getting control of Grazer One and using it to get his revenge and get rich in the process. To do this he hijacks Ryback's train because the two people with the access codes are also aboard. Once he has control of the train and the Satellite he gives a demonstration of its power by destroying a chemical weapons facility in China. Ryback, who has been separated from his niece, teams up with the porter to take on the bad guys to save his niece and prevent the destruction of Washington DC. This isn't a bad action film but people expecting it to be anywhere near as good as Ryback's first outing will be sorely disappointed... a train just isn't as good a setting as a battleship for starters and the lack of A-list bad guys shows. Steven Seagal puts in a decent performance as Ryback; he might not do emotion but he knows how to do action and that is the main reason to watch his films! Katherine Heigl is good but very underused as his niece; she would have been a much better sidekick than Morris Chestnut's character... he didn't do a bad job it's just that 'comedy sidekicks' are almost always more annoying than they are amusing. Everett McGill wasn't bad as mercenary leader Marcus Penn but the main villain Travis Dane; played by Eric Bogosian was just too over the top to take seriously. The plot was okay even if the weapon was just a bit too sci-fi for my liking. The main reason to watch films like this is to see lots of action and in this department it does deliver with lots of shooting, explosions, knife-fights and martial arts. It also managed to dodge one or two action movie clich&eacute;s... I was certain that the female terrorist was there to have a climactic fight with Ryback's niece but as it turned out she didn't get involved much despite us being told early on that he'd taught her how to fight. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want to watch some good mindless action... good enough that I'm surprised Ryback didn't appear in future films.

    "Under Siege" is by far Steven Seagal's best movie. It pretty much contains everything you could wish for in a Seagal film and more: bone-breaking action, convincing special effects, a tremendous pace, entertaining actors (Gary Busey! Tommy Lee Jones! That chick from "Baywatch"!) and for once even a villain that actually puts up a fight. The loosely related "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" manages to keep some of those good points, but totally misfires on others. Seagal gets to kill a lot of people in this one and occasionally does so in pretty creative ways, but his invincibility just gets tiresome here. The main antagonist can drink pepper spray, but he can't even get a single shot in? Please. The computer genius henchman (or maybe he's the main baddie, the hierarchy is sorta vague) is even worse, badly played and not nearly as interesting as the makers think he is. The movie also seems to go on for too long, the writers constantly have to add additional hijinks because otherwise the plot would be resolved in about half an hour. Pretty much everything Morris Chestnut gets to say or do is padding, which is sort of a shame given that he's pretty much the best actor in the cast. I think he's supposed to be comic relief, but who can even tell with this kind of writing? "Under Siege 2" isn't very bad, but it can't hold a candle to its "predecessor".

    Seagal returns as Casey Ryback, SEAL turned cook. Oddly enough, apart from the same character, there is almost no mention of the first film, there's none of Die Hard 2's 'How can the same stuff happen to the same guy twice?' going on here. But instead of a battleship being seized by hostages it is a train, as the poster above makes plain as day. This time, instead of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey crazy-ing it up as the villains, you have a computer hacker and his mercenaries using the train to take control of an awesome weapons satellite. I'm not going to give a spoiler alert warning this time because if you're worried about me spoiling the 'plot' of this film, you're watching the wrong film.

A movie can do no more than deliver the goods one is seeking, and this one does it in the best tradition. It has a relentless tone of tension and violence and a plethora of villains led by a sweaty, nerdy, whiny genius who mass murders with a gleam and a vengeance worthy of Fu Manchu or Dr. Doom. This has non-stop carnage and a raw feeling to it all that is both unpleasant and over the top comic-book like extreme. Casey Ryback is more like a Superhero in this one doing death defying feats and uncanny rescues. Nothing here is real it just feels that way. The martial arts fights are some of Seagal's best and it is doubtful a more intense train wreck was ever put on film. This is an adrenaline movie with one rush after another. A money's worth of entertainment that holds up among its peers as pure, penetrating, and powerful. It is searing cinema and never lets up for a minute delivering one thrill after another. If you can't find an Action Flick fix here, you are without Jones.

    In terms of action film sequels, I thought this was superior to "Die Hard 2" or "Rambo First Blood Part 2", the enigmatic Seagal once again under siege from terrorists, this time, Eric Bogosian and his hired gun Everett McGill aboard a train. Bogosian has hijacked a nuclear satellite via his laptop and is training it on multiple targets around the globe with the intention of setting off a chain reaction that will either destroy the world or deliver him a king's ransom for withholding the threat. Morris Chestnut plays an unlikely purser enlisted by Seagal to help subdue the threat, future star Katherine Heigl plays Seagal's daughter whose aboard the ride into hell, and among a substantial supporting cast are Royce D.Applegate as Seagal's trusted chef, Nick Mancuso as the chain-smoking Pentagon official reprising his role, Dale Dye, Kurtwood Smith and Phyllis Davis in minor roles. The usual array of flashy stunts, knife-work and hand-to-hand combat scenes do the business, with Everett McGill a very capable adversary to the one-man wrecking ball Seagal, who again manages to suppress his uber-cool so as not to become a self parody. Logic might dictate it easy to dismiss these sequels, and the fact there hasn't (yet) been a second sequel might suggest otherwise, but it's worth a viewing.

    This sequel sees Navy seal/chef Casey Ryback taking a train journey through the Rockies with his niece Sarah... needless to say the journey does not go as smoothly as planned. The US Military has just launched a top secret satellite based weapon known as Grazer One; it was designed by Travis Dane who everybody believes killed himself after he was fired. In reality Dane is very much alive and intent on getting control of Grazer One and using it to get his revenge and get rich in the process. To do this he hijacks Ryback's train because the two people with the access codes are also aboard. Once he has control of the train and the Satellite he gives a demonstration of its power by destroying a chemical weapons facility in China. Ryback, who has been separated from his niece, teams up with the porter to take on the bad guys to save his niece and prevent the destruction of Washington DC. This isn't a bad action film but people expecting it to be anywhere near as good as Ryback's first outing will be sorely disappointed... a train just isn't as good a setting as a battleship for starters and the lack of A-list bad guys shows. Steven Seagal puts in a decent performance as Ryback; he might not do emotion but he knows how to do action and that is the main reason to watch his films! Katherine Heigl is good but very underused as his niece; she would have been a much better sidekick than Morris Chestnut's character... he didn't do a bad job it's just that 'comedy sidekicks' are almost always more annoying than they are amusing. Everett McGill wasn't bad as mercenary leader Marcus Penn but the main villain Travis Dane; played by Eric Bogosian was just too over the top to take seriously. The plot was okay even if the weapon was just a bit too sci-fi for my liking. The main reason to watch films like this is to see lots of action and in this department it does deliver with lots of shooting, explosions, knife-fights and martial arts. It also managed to dodge one or two action movie clich&eacute;s... I was certain that the female terrorist was there to have a climactic fight with Ryback's niece but as it turned out she didn't get involved much despite us being told early on that he'd taught her how to fight. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want to watch some good mindless action... good enough that I'm surprised Ryback didn't appear in future films.

    "Under Siege" is by far Steven Seagal's best movie. It pretty much contains everything you could wish for in a Seagal film and more: bone-breaking action, convincing special effects, a tremendous pace, entertaining actors (Gary Busey! Tommy Lee Jones! That chick from "Baywatch"!) and for once even a villain that actually puts up a fight. The loosely related "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" manages to keep some of those good points, but totally misfires on others. Seagal gets to kill a lot of people in this one and occasionally does so in pretty creative ways, but his invincibility just gets tiresome here. The main antagonist can drink pepper spray, but he can't even get a single shot in? Please. The computer genius henchman (or maybe he's the main baddie, the hierarchy is sorta vague) is even worse, badly played and not nearly as interesting as the makers think he is. The movie also seems to go on for too long, the writers constantly have to add additional hijinks because otherwise the plot would be resolved in about half an hour. Pretty much everything Morris Chestnut gets to say or do is padding, which is sort of a shame given that he's pretty much the best actor in the cast. I think he's supposed to be comic relief, but who can even tell with this kind of writing? "Under Siege 2" isn't very bad, but it can't hold a candle to its "predecessor".

    Seagal returns as Casey Ryback, SEAL turned cook. Oddly enough, apart from the same character, there is almost no mention of the first film, there's none of Die Hard 2's 'How can the same stuff happen to the same guy twice?' going on here. But instead of a battleship being seized by hostages it is a train, as the poster above makes plain as day. This time, instead of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey crazy-ing it up as the villains, you have a computer hacker and his mercenaries using the train to take control of an awesome weapons satellite. I'm not going to give a spoiler alert warning this time because if you're worried about me spoiling the 'plot' of this film, you're watching the wrong film. So whilst the set up is similar (mode of transport aside), we have added into the mix Ryback's niece, played by Katherine Heigl. Whilst she is not given much to do, Heigl does stand out as one of the better performers in this film. The villains (as I said earlier) pale in comparison with the baddies of the first film and there is none of the menace or cunning. Instead you have the writers stretching the bounds of plausibility to stretch Seagal's game of hide-and-seek over nearly 100 minutes. Needless to say, this is one of the worst film I've seen in a long, long time. It is so bad it is hilarious. Some of the particulars of the plot caused me to break out into rich peals of laughter like the merry bell I am. One particular line 'Oh my god! An earthquake....in midair.' (DURRRRRRR!) was a standout as was the delaying of the terrorist's plans as an investment banker wants to pay $110 million dollars to explode an airliner carrying his ex-wife. It is baffling! Amusing but baffling, no one told me this film was a comedy.

    Steven Seagal is one of those people I have a real chip on my shoulder about. He is the epitome of the monotone stuntman made into a leading man, replacing charisma and genuine acting with chop-socky action and the same tired plot over and over again. Like a fat Chuck Norris, Seagal's only real gem was the enjoyably trashy "Under Siege" and it came as no surprise that Seagal returned to the formula a few short years later. Trouble is, can lightning really strike twice or was the first one a mere fluke? Seagal once again plays Casey Rybeck, a former Navy SEAL now working as a chef. After his brother is killed in a plane crash, Rybeck takes a cross-country train with his niece Sarah (a young Katherine Heigl) but disaster strikes during the journey. A bunch of terrorists take control of the train and passengers, using it as a base for deranged scientist Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) to take control of a top secret weapons satellite. But Rybeck manages to evade capture and working alongside porter Bobby (Morris Chestnut), begins to take the fight to the terrorists. Seagal films, almost by definition, aren't going to be classics so bear that in mind. Having that said, "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" isn't anything like as bad as other efforts like "Hard To Kill". It's almost embarrassingly dumb and stupid but in spite of its faults, I still enjoyed myself. Seagal doesn't even try to act - his emotional state remains the same in every scene, regardless of what's happening in it - and Heigl does OK as the damsel in distress but Bogosian is a wild-eyed psycho and in that respect, the perfect foil for the pony-tailed punchbag. Plot-wise, this is much more stupid than its predecessor - the utter annihilation of a city in China halfway through is forgotten about by the time Seagal begins his martial arts mission and naturally, the principal terrorist (Everett McGill) just happens to have been taught by Rybeck at Navy SEAL school (or whatever!). Nonsense, of course but still enjoyable nonsense. The only real downside to this is that it isn't as good as "Under Siege" and seeing as Seagal films can only compete with other Seagal films, this makes "Under Siege 2" the second best action film there is. In the greater scheme of things, this is decidedly average at best but at least it isn't as bad as almost any other Seagal film I could mention. It's stupid but stupidly entertaining, assuming you can forgive its faults and just switch your brain off for this one. It might not be big or clever but at least it's mildly diverting.

    All right, guys. Let's admit it. This one is a classic. Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films I'm eternally thankful. I still can't change the channel every time this one comes on. C'mon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. What's not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like "Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you" I'm surprised this thing didn't win the Oscar for best script...lol. But seriously, with so much testosterone flying around, helped by Basil Poledouris's rousing score, and so much cool train climbing action (over, under, all over) I sometimes wonder if this one isn't even better than the first one - helmed by Andrew Davis. I mean the Eric Bogosian/Everett McGill combo is just as good as the Tommy Lee Jones/Gary Busey combo! And the kill quip by Seagal (after he dispatches McGill) "Nobody beats me in the kitchen" is right up there with some of the best quips in the Bond pictures. Anyway it's one of the top films of 1995. I have come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong when using the DIE HARD formula. I have yet to see a bad DIE HARD clone. SPEED, CLIFFHANGER, UNDER SIEGE, SUDDEN DEATH, AIR FORCE ONE, CON AIR, etc. Die Hard on a Bus, Die Hard on a Mountain, Die Hard on a Ship/Train, Die Hard in a Hockey Arena, Die Hard on a Plane, etc.

    Big fan of the original, always like a bit of naval action and you felt that Segal finally had found a role that allowed him to exploit his limited acting talents and formidable martial arts expertise and military skills. We would have quite happily have followed Casey Ryback through a series of adventures, hell, even a TV series but unfortunately this film seems to have killed off a possibly enjoyable franchise which is something of a shame. The Good? As with the original the best part of the film is where Ryback finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation and starts to use his knowledge and training to fight back and slowly regain the initiative from the bad guys. Oddly I rather love the scene where he rewires his electronic diary to the train's payphone in order to send for help, he's about more than just blowing things up and killing folks with his bare hands. Eric Borgosian is very good in his role as the malevolent genius and the action sequences stand up extremely well. Segal's reality series Lawman has actually raised my opinion of him a great deal, you see him actually restraining real violent suspects and confronting armed criminals gun in hand so it's very easy to believe he can do the same in fiction. Also nice to see character actor Royce Applegate playing something other than a good-old-boy villain. The Bad? Everett McGill just doesn't cut it as Penn, good actor but just doesn't convince. Now his character is very smart, figuring a great deal of Ryback's moves out but he just lacks the charisma and chemistry of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in the first film. So lame that he has his own glamorous hit-chick, what a clich&eacute;! You also wonder how much the success of the first film depended on a near naked Erika Eliniak jumping out of the cake? A teenage Katherine Hiegl and Sandra Taylor are both gorgeous but neither do anything remotely sexy (there's a great comedy sketch waiting to be written where a boyfriend tells his delighted girlfriend he's rented them a Katherine Hiegl film to watch as part of their romantic evening but rather than the expected romcom it turns out to be Under Siege 2). So an enjoyable film but a missed opportunity.

    This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. I just LOVE this movie and everything about it. In Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, terrorists hijack a passenger train, to set it up as a mobile and undetectable base for Travis Dane to use his high-tech computers to control a government nuclear satellite in hopes of blowing up the Pentagon, and the entire eastern seaboard. Funny, terrorists hijack a train to hijack a satellite. Anyway, all is going well for the terrorists, they have the perfect plan, take over a train, use it to blow up what they want, and then get rid of the evidence by driving in into a gasoline train. But, there's just one problem, and its the cook, Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) who is really an Ex-Navy Seal. And he is a flaw that will epically ruin Dane's plan. Steven Seagal, what a great actor, you can really tell who he is by his tone in this movie, which he's calm, he whispers, it's just great acting, and not just by Steven, ALL the actors in this movie. It's great acting and directing, and I Love the performance. The plot, while having some flaws, they are easily over-looked by the great action and peril going on. This movie was SO good at pulling me into it, I actually forgot I had seen the entire plot of this movie on Wikipedia, I was watching the movie, knowing what was going to happen, and I was STILL in suspense, I Loved the first Under Siege as well, and this movie is absolutely a 10 star movie. No mater what type of genre you are into, see this movie.

    It was a great movie. It was Seagal's best performance in my opinion. Travis Dane did a good job as the villain even though he was not scary, and it's just a great movie. I like the suspense, the action, etc. If Dane was also scarier it would have been even better. But it was still a great movie. I loved it. Also Ryback's niece was gorgeous. I also liked the location, etc. They should do an Under Siege 3. Even though Dane was more evil I found Penn more intimidating. But it was still a great movie. I own it on DVD and I would watch it again and again. Also I like trains and I really liked the fact that it took place on a train. I like trains even better than cars. Great movie.

    All right, guys. Let's admit it. This one is a classic. Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films I'm eternally thankful. I still can't change the channel every time this one comes on. C'mon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. What's not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like "Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you" I'm surprised this thing didn't win the Oscar for best script...lol. But seriously, with so much testosterone flying around, helped by Basil Poledouris's rousing score, and so much cool train climbing action (over, under, all over) I sometimes wonder if this one isn't even better than the first one - helmed by Andrew Davis. I mean the Eric Bogosian/Everett McGill combo is just as good as the Tommy Lee Jones/Gary Busey combo! And the kill quip by Seagal (after he dispatches McGill) "Nobody beats me in the kitchen" is right up there with some of the best quips in the Bond pictures. Anyway it's one of the top films of 1995. I have come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong when using the DIE HARD formula. I have yet to see a bad DIE HARD clone. SPEED, CLIFFHANGER, UNDER SIEGE, SUDDEN DEATH, AIR FORCE ONE, CON AIR, etc. Die Hard on a Bus, Die Hard on a Mountain, Die Hard on a Ship/Train, Die Hard in a Hockey Arena, Die Hard on a Plane, etc.

    Big fan of the original, always like a bit of naval action and you felt that Segal finally had found a role that allowed him to exploit his limited acting talents and formidable martial arts expertise and military skills. We would have quite happily have followed Casey Ryback through a series of adventures, hell, even a TV series but unfortunately this film seems to have killed off a possibly enjoyable franchise which is something of a shame. The Good? As with the original the best part of the film is where Ryback finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation and starts to use his knowledge and training to fight back and slowly regain the initiative from the bad guys. Oddly I rather love the scene where he rewires his electronic diary to the train's payphone in order to send for help, he's about more than just blowing things up and killing folks with his bare hands. Eric Borgosian is very good in his role as the malevolent genius and the action sequences stand up extremely well. Segal's reality series Lawman has actually raised my opinion of him a great deal, you see him actually restraining real violent suspects and confronting armed criminals gun in hand so it's very easy to believe he can do the same in fiction. Also nice to see character actor Royce Applegate playing something other than a good-old-boy villain. The Bad? Everett McGill just doesn't cut it as Penn, good actor but just doesn't convince. Now his character is very smart, figuring a great deal of Ryback's moves out but he just lacks the charisma and chemistry of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in the first film. So lame that he has his own glamorous hit-chick, what a clich&eacute;! You also wonder how much the success of the first film depended on a near naked Erika Eliniak jumping out of the cake? A teenage Katherine Hiegl and Sandra Taylor are both gorgeous but neither do anything remotely sexy (there's a great comedy sketch waiting to be written where a boyfriend tells his delighted girlfriend he's rented them a Katherine Hiegl film to watch as part of their romantic evening but rather than the expected romcom it turns out to be Under Siege 2). So an enjoyable film but a missed opportunity.

    This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. I just LOVE this movie and everything about it. In Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, terrorists hijack a passenger train, to set it up as a mobile and undetectable base for Travis Dane to use his high-tech computers to control a government nuclear satellite in hopes of blowing up the Pentagon, and the entire eastern seaboard. Funny, terrorists hijack a train to hijack a satellite. Anyway, all is going well for the terrorists, they have the perfect plan, take over a train, use it to blow up what they want, and then get rid of the evidence by driving in into a gasoline train. But, there's just one problem, and its the cook, Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) who is really an Ex-Navy Seal. And he is a flaw that will epically ruin Dane's plan. Steven Seagal, what a great actor, you can really tell who he is by his tone in this movie, which he's calm, he whispers, it's just great acting, and not just by Steven, ALL the actors in this movie. It's great acting and directing, and I Love the performance. The plot, while having some flaws, they are easily over-looked by the great action and peril going on. This movie was SO good at pulling me into it, I actually forgot I had seen the entire plot of this movie on Wikipedia, I was watching the movie, knowing what was going to happen, and I was STILL in suspense, I Loved the first Under Siege as well, and this movie is absolutely a 10 star movie. No mater what type of genre you are into, see this movie.

    It was a great movie. It was Seagal's best performance in my opinion. Travis Dane did a good job as the villain even though he was not scary, and it's just a great movie. I like the suspense, the action, etc. If Dane was also scarier it would have been even better. But it was still a great movie. I loved it. Also Ryback's niece was gorgeous. I also liked the location, etc. They should do an Under Siege 3. Even though Dane was more evil I found Penn more intimidating. But it was still a great movie. I own it on DVD and I would watch it again and again. Also I like trains and I really liked the fact that it took place on a train. I like trains even better than cars. Great movie.

    In the realm of the action movie this one has to be among the best. Detractors seem to have it in for Steven Seagal and are quick to pile on unnecessarily. A movie can do no more than deliver the goods one is seeking, and this one does it in the best tradition. It has a relentless tone of tension and violence and a plethora of villains led by a sweaty, nerdy, whiny genius who mass murders with a gleam and a vengeance worthy of Fu Manchu or Dr. Doom. This has non-stop carnage and a raw feeling to it all that is both unpleasant and over the top comic-book like extreme. Casey Ryback is more like a Superhero in this one doing death defying feats and uncanny rescues. Nothing here is real it just feels that way. The martial arts fights are some of Seagal's best and it is doubtful a more intense train wreck was ever put on film. This is an adrenaline movie with one rush after another. A money's worth of entertainment that holds up among its peers as pure, penetrating, and powerful. It is searing cinema and never lets up for a minute delivering one thrill after another. If you can't find an Action Flick fix here, you are without Jones.

    In terms of action film sequels, I thought this was superior to "Die Hard 2" or "Rambo First Blood Part 2", the enigmatic Seagal once again under siege from terrorists, this time, Eric Bogosian and his hired gun Everett McGill aboard a train. Bogosian has hijacked a nuclear satellite via his laptop and is training it on multiple targets around the globe with the intention of setting off a chain reaction that will either destroy the world or deliver him a king's ransom for withholding the threat. Morris Chestnut plays an unlikely purser enlisted by Seagal to help subdue the threat, future star Katherine Heigl plays Seagal's daughter whose aboard the ride into hell, and among a substantial supporting cast are Royce D.Applegate as Seagal's trusted chef, Nick Mancuso as the chain-smoking Pentagon official reprising his role, Dale Dye, Kurtwood Smith and Phyllis Davis in minor roles. The usual array of flashy stunts, knife-work and hand-to-hand combat scenes do the business, with Everett McGill a very capable adversary to the one-man wrecking ball Seagal, who again manages to suppress his uber-cool so as not to become a self parody. Logic might dictate it easy to dismiss these sequels, and the fact there hasn't (yet) been a second sequel might suggest otherwise, but it's worth a viewing.

    This sequel sees Navy seal/chef Casey Ryback taking a train journey through the Rockies with his niece Sarah... needless to say the journey does not go as smoothly as planned. The US Military has just launched a top secret satellite based weapon known as Grazer One; it was designed by Travis Dane who everybody believes killed himself after he was fired. In reality Dane is very much alive and intent on getting control of Grazer One and using it to get his revenge and get rich in the process. To do this he hijacks Ryback's train because the two people with the access codes are also aboard. Once he has control of the train and the Satellite he gives a demonstration of its power by destroying a chemical weapons facility in China. Ryback, who has been separated from his niece, teams up with the porter to take on the bad guys to save his niece and prevent the destruction of Washington DC. This isn't a bad action film but people expecting it to be anywhere near as good as Ryback's first outing will be sorely disappointed... a train just isn't as good a setting as a battleship for starters and the lack of A-list bad guys shows. Steven Seagal puts in a decent performance as Ryback; he might not do emotion but he knows how to do action and that is the main reason to watch his films! Katherine Heigl is good but very underused as his niece; she would have been a much better sidekick than Morris Chestnut's character... he didn't do a bad job it's just that 'comedy sidekicks' are almost always more annoying than they are amusing. Everett McGill wasn't bad as mercenary leader Marcus Penn but the main villain Travis Dane; played by Eric Bogosian was just too over the top to take seriously. The plot was okay even if the weapon was just a bit too sci-fi for my liking. The main reason to watch films like this is to see lots of action and in this department it does deliver with lots of shooting, explosions, knife-fights and martial arts. It also managed to dodge one or two action movie clich&eacute;s... I was certain that the female terrorist was there to have a climactic fight with Ryback's niece but as it turned out she didn't get involved much despite us being told early on that he'd taught her how to fight. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want to watch some good mindless action... good enough that I'm surprised Ryback didn't appear in future films.

    "Under Siege" is by far Steven Seagal's best movie. It pretty much contains everything you could wish for in a Seagal film and more: bone-breaking action, convincing special effects, a tremendous pace, entertaining actors (Gary Busey! Tommy Lee Jones! That chick from "Baywatch"!) and for once even a villain that actually puts up a fight. The loosely related "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" manages to keep some of those good points, but totally misfires on others. Seagal gets to kill a lot of people in this one and occasionally does so in pretty creative ways, but his invincibility just gets tiresome here. The main antagonist can drink pepper spray, but he can't even get a single shot in? Please. The computer genius henchman (or maybe he's the main baddie, the hierarchy is sorta vague) is even worse, badly played and not nearly as interesting as the makers think he is. The movie also seems to go on for too long, the writers constantly have to add additional hijinks because otherwise the plot would be resolved in about half an hour. Pretty much everything Morris Chestnut gets to say or do is padding, which is sort of a shame given that he's pretty much the best actor in the cast. I think he's supposed to be comic relief, but who can even tell with this kind of writing? "Under Siege 2" isn't very bad, but it can't hold a candle to its "predecessor".

    Seagal returns as Casey Ryback, SEAL turned cook. Oddly enough, apart from the same character, there is almost no mention of the first film, there's none of Die Hard 2's 'How can the same stuff happen to the same guy twice?' going on here. But instead of a battleship being seized by hostages it is a train, as the poster above makes plain as day. This time, instead of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey crazy-ing it up as the villains, you have a computer hacker and his mercenaries using the train to take control of an awesome weapons satellite. I'm not going to give a spoiler alert warning this time because if you're worried about me spoiling the 'plot' of this film, you're watching the wrong film. So whilst the set up is similar (mode of transport aside), we have added into the mix Ryback's niece, played by Katherine Heigl. Whilst she is not given much to do, Heigl does stand out as one of the better performers in this film. The villains (as I said earlier) pale in comparison with the baddies of the first film and there is none of the menace or cunning. Instead you have the writers stretching the bounds of plausibility to stretch Seagal's game of hide-and-seek over nearly 100 minutes. Needless to say, this is one of the worst film I've seen in a long, long time. It is so bad it is hilarious. Some of the particulars of the plot caused me to break out into rich peals of laughter like the merry bell I am. One particular line 'Oh my god! An earthquake....in midair.' (DURRRRRRR!) was a standout as was the delaying of the terrorist's plans as an investment banker wants to pay $110 million dollars to explode an airliner carrying his ex-wife. It is baffling! Amusing but baffling, no one told me this film was a comedy.

    Steven Seagal is one of those people I have a real chip on my shoulder about. He is the epitome of the monotone stuntman made into a leading man, replacing charisma and genuine acting with chop-socky action and the same tired plot over and over again. Like a fat Chuck Norris, Seagal's only real gem was the enjoyably trashy "Under Siege" and it came as no surprise that Seagal returned to the formula a few short years later. Trouble is, can lightning really strike twice or was the first one a mere fluke? Seagal once again plays Casey Rybeck, a former Navy SEAL now working as a chef. After his brother is killed in a plane crash, Rybeck takes a cross-country train with his niece Sarah (a young Katherine Heigl) but disaster strikes during the journey. A bunch of terrorists take control of the train and passengers, using it as a base for deranged scientist Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) to take control of a top secret weapons satellite. But Rybeck manages to evade capture and working alongside porter Bobby (Morris Chestnut), begins to take the fight to the terrorists. Seagal films, almost by definition, aren't going to be classics so bear that in mind. Having that said, "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" isn't anything like as bad as other efforts like "Hard To Kill". It's almost embarrassingly dumb and stupid but in spite of its faults, I still enjoyed myself. Seagal doesn't even try to act - his emotional state remains the same in every scene, regardless of what's happening in it - and Heigl does OK as the damsel in distress but Bogosian is a wild-eyed psycho and in that respect, the perfect foil for the pony-tailed punchbag. Plot-wise, this is much more stupid than its predecessor - the utter annihilation of a city in China halfway through is forgotten about by the time Seagal begins his martial arts mission and naturally, the principal terrorist (Everett McGill) just happens to have been taught by Rybeck at Navy SEAL school (or whatever!). Nonsense, of course but still enjoyable nonsense. The only real downside to this is that it isn't as good as "Under Siege" and seeing as Seagal films can only compete with other Seagal films, this makes "Under Siege 2" the second best action film there is. In the greater scheme of things, this is decidedly average at best but at least it isn't as bad as almost any other Seagal film I could mention. It's stupid but stupidly entertaining, assuming you can forgive its faults and just switch your brain off for this one. It might not be big or clever but at least it's mildly diverting.

The main reason to watch films like this is to see lots of action and in this department it does deliver with lots of shooting, explosions, knife-fights and martial arts. It also managed to dodge one or two action movie clich&eacute;s... I was certain that the female terrorist was there to have a climactic fight with Ryback's niece but as it turned out she didn't get involved much despite us being told early on that he'd taught her how to fight. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want to watch some good mindless action... good enough that I'm surprised Ryback didn't appear in future films.

    "Under Siege" is by far Steven Seagal's best movie. It pretty much contains everything you could wish for in a Seagal film and more: bone-breaking action, convincing special effects, a tremendous pace, entertaining actors (Gary Busey! Tommy Lee Jones! That chick from "Baywatch"!) and for once even a villain that actually puts up a fight. The loosely related "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" manages to keep some of those good points, but totally misfires on others. Seagal gets to kill a lot of people in this one and occasionally does so in pretty creative ways, but his invincibility just gets tiresome here. The main antagonist can drink pepper spray, but he can't even get a single shot in? Please. The computer genius henchman (or maybe he's the main baddie, the hierarchy is sorta vague) is even worse, badly played and not nearly as interesting as the makers think he is. The movie also seems to go on for too long, the writers constantly have to add additional hijinks because otherwise the plot would be resolved in about half an hour. Pretty much everything Morris Chestnut gets to say or do is padding, which is sort of a shame given that he's pretty much the best actor in the cast. I think he's supposed to be comic relief, but who can even tell with this kind of writing? "Under Siege 2" isn't very bad, but it can't hold a candle to its "predecessor".

    Seagal returns as Casey Ryback, SEAL turned cook. Oddly enough, apart from the same character, there is almost no mention of the first film, there's none of Die Hard 2's 'How can the same stuff happen to the same guy twice?' going on here. But instead of a battleship being seized by hostages it is a train, as the poster above makes plain as day. This time, instead of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey crazy-ing it up as the villains, you have a computer hacker and his mercenaries using the train to take control of an awesome weapons satellite. I'm not going to give a spoiler alert warning this time because if you're worried about me spoiling the 'plot' of this film, you're watching the wrong film. So whilst the set up is similar (mode of transport aside), we have added into the mix Ryback's niece, played by Katherine Heigl. Whilst she is not given much to do, Heigl does stand out as one of the better performers in this film. The villains (as I said earlier) pale in comparison with the baddies of the first film and there is none of the menace or cunning. Instead you have the writers stretching the bounds of plausibility to stretch Seagal's game of hide-and-seek over nearly 100 minutes. Needless to say, this is one of the worst film I've seen in a long, long time. It is so bad it is hilarious. Some of the particulars of the plot caused me to break out into rich peals of laughter like the merry bell I am. One particular line 'Oh my god! An earthquake....in midair.' (DURRRRRRR!) was a standout as was the delaying of the terrorist's plans as an investment banker wants to pay $110 million dollars to explode an airliner carrying his ex-wife. It is baffling! Amusing but baffling, no one told me this film was a comedy.

    Steven Seagal is one of those people I have a real chip on my shoulder about. He is the epitome of the monotone stuntman made into a leading man, replacing charisma and genuine acting with chop-socky action and the same tired plot over and over again. Like a fat Chuck Norris, Seagal's only real gem was the enjoyably trashy "Under Siege" and it came as no surprise that Seagal returned to the formula a few short years later. Trouble is, can lightning really strike twice or was the first one a mere fluke? Seagal once again plays Casey Rybeck, a former Navy SEAL now working as a chef. After his brother is killed in a plane crash, Rybeck takes a cross-country train with his niece Sarah (a young Katherine Heigl) but disaster strikes during the journey. A bunch of terrorists take control of the train and passengers, using it as a base for deranged scientist Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) to take control of a top secret weapons satellite. But Rybeck manages to evade capture and working alongside porter Bobby (Morris Chestnut), begins to take the fight to the terrorists. Seagal films, almost by definition, aren't going to be classics so bear that in mind. Having that said, "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" isn't anything like as bad as other efforts like "Hard To Kill". It's almost embarrassingly dumb and stupid but in spite of its faults, I still enjoyed myself. Seagal doesn't even try to act - his emotional state remains the same in every scene, regardless of what's happening in it - and Heigl does OK as the damsel in distress but Bogosian is a wild-eyed psycho and in that respect, the perfect foil for the pony-tailed punchbag. Plot-wise, this is much more stupid than its predecessor - the utter annihilation of a city in China halfway through is forgotten about by the time Seagal begins his martial arts mission and naturally, the principal terrorist (Everett McGill) just happens to have been taught by Rybeck at Navy SEAL school (or whatever!). Nonsense, of course but still enjoyable nonsense. The only real downside to this is that it isn't as good as "Under Siege" and seeing as Seagal films can only compete with other Seagal films, this makes "Under Siege 2" the second best action film there is. In the greater scheme of things, this is decidedly average at best but at least it isn't as bad as almost any other Seagal film I could mention. It's stupid but stupidly entertaining, assuming you can forgive its faults and just switch your brain off for this one. It might not be big or clever but at least it's mildly diverting.

    All right, guys. Let's admit it. This one is a classic. Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films I'm eternally thankful. I still can't change the channel every time this one comes on. C'mon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. What's not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like "Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you" I'm surprised this thing didn't win the Oscar for best script...lol. But seriously, with so much testosterone flying around, helped by Basil Poledouris's rousing score, and so much cool train climbing action (over, under, all over) I sometimes wonder if this one isn't even better than the first one - helmed by Andrew Davis. I mean the Eric Bogosian/Everett McGill combo is just as good as the Tommy Lee Jones/Gary Busey combo! And the kill quip by Seagal (after he dispatches McGill) "Nobody beats me in the kitchen" is right up there with some of the best quips in the Bond pictures. Anyway it's one of the top films of 1995. I have come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong when using the DIE HARD formula. I have yet to see a bad DIE HARD clone. SPEED, CLIFFHANGER, UNDER SIEGE, SUDDEN DEATH, AIR FORCE ONE, CON AIR, etc. Die Hard on a Bus, Die Hard on a Mountain, Die Hard on a Ship/Train, Die Hard in a Hockey Arena, Die Hard on a Plane, etc.
