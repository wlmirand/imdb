 <sinopse>
  A scientist tries to prove the existence of the Loch Ness monster.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Dr. Dempsey, an American scientist who has become a skeptic after a disastrous wrong call, isn't exactly enthusiastic to be sent by his well-funded employer to Scotland to (dis)prove the existence of the Loch Ness monster, but has no choice. He finds the locals stubborn, 'primitive' and all but hospitable, not in the least because the Nessie legend is the only tourist attraction, but still gets romantically attracted by his independent inn-keeper Laura, and both her kid and his enthusiastic local assistant end up making him face a small family of Nessie-dinosaurs, but is this to be made public?

    If you're happy to suspend your disbelief for the duration then this is for you. I'd never heard of it before it popped up on TV yesterday and I figured I liked Ted Danson in Cheers and Joly Richardson isn't exactly chopped liver so I'll watch the first reel and see what happens. Okay, forget looking for the monster if I thought there was a lady as lovely Joley Richardson walking around loose in a small Scottish village I'd light out for bonnie Scotland in jig-time. As several posters have remarked here this is a genuine feel-good entry, sort of Disney-lite, with no swearing, no violence to speak of and an offbeat love story thrown in - in fact the girl bringing her single mom together with a prospect she, the girl has picked out is hardly new and I can trace it back to Natalie Wood brokering a romance between screen mum Maureen O'Hara and husband/stepfather material John Payne in the original Miracle on 34th Street but it's no worse for that.

    Loch Ness is directed by John Henderson and written by John Fusco. It stars Ted Danson, Joely Richardson, Ian Holm, Kirsty Graham and James Frain. Music is scored by Trevor Jones and cinematography is by Clive Tickner. Plot sees Danson as Zoologist Jonathan Dempsey, who has now become something of a joke in his field after a failed "beastie hunt" for the Yeti. In the last chance saloon, he's packed off by his superiors to debunk the Loch Ness Monster legend, where hardly enthused anyway, he finds a small community unwelcome to his being there. After finally booking into a small inn run by single mother Laura McFetridge (Richardson) Dempsey forms a warm relationship with Laura's nine year old daughter, Isabel (Graham), who just may hold the key to the mystery of Loch Ness. Once it was made available for viewing it struggled to gain any significant support, both by critics and film fans alike. Caught in the 1990's creature feature slipstream created by Jurassic Park, hopes were high for a very different type of Loch Ness Monster movie. Nobody, except for the film makers, were quite prepared for what type of film Loch Ness is. Henderson's film is a human interest story first and foremost, one that has the Loch Ness Monster as its backdrop. It is driven by a mismatched (developing) love story, yet still has enough about it to raise the pertinent question that crowns the story, namely why? And should we? Solve the Loch Ness Monster mystery. It's all very simple and low-key, where any expectation of an FX extravaganza will lead you only to a big disappointment. Helps, too, if you kind of want to believe in the fantastical, like a bit of whimsy with your film supper. An insult often used to beat it with is that it copies Local Hero's template. What is wrong with that? Since Local Hero itself is a charming human fable set in similar gorgeous locale, why not have that delightful film as a marker? In fact Loch Ness is more family friendly, adult enough for the discerning grown up, whilst beguiling the kiddies too. And lets rejoice the sparse use of special effects, what we get is brief, and dare I say it? Magical. Fusco's script is also witty, with much fun mined from Danson's fish out of water portrayal as he finds himself at odds with everyone except the Nessie keen assistant played with wide eyed energy by Frain. The rest of the cast are roundly great as well, Danson (affable supreme), Richardson (quality Scottish accent), Holm (grumpy curmudgeon) and Graham (one of the most natural and unfussy child performances ever), lead the way. While good secondary support comes from a barking mad Keith Allen and Nick Brimble as the self appointed love rival for Laura's attentions. Bolstering the film is a majestic score from Jones, with the expected Celtic harmonies neatly sitting along side the more brassy and keyboard thrusts as the narrative hits its peaks. The synth and string arrangement that accompanies "Nessie" is simply beautiful and the reason why this particular writer had to buy the score. Although the Highland/Lochs locations used for filming are to die for, the film needed a better cinematographer than Tickner. He's good on something like sci-fi trasher Split Second, where he gets away with washed out apocalyptic colours, but here his photography is often murky and the sumptuous colours of the scenery never boom out from the screen. He does, however, know how to light a pretty face, the beautiful Richardson benefiting greatly here. With a big human heart and awash with family friendly mysticism, Loch Ness is a lovely picture. Thankfully for those who now know what to expect, it's a mile away from being a creature feature. 8.5/10

    Dempsey (Ted Danson) is a sort of photojournalist of the weird happenings on planet earth. Having fallen on somewhat hard times, he, nevertheless, is reluctant to attempt his next assignment. The boss directs him to Scotland, where he is to use modern technology to PROVE once and for all that there is no Nessie Monster. There is no real choice but for Dempsey to get on a plane. When he lands, he almost drives over a pretty local lady, Laura (Joely Richardson). In short order, he finds out that she has the only rooming house and, after some begging, she lets him a room. Also in the house is her beautiful young daughter, Isabella (Kirsty Graham). Of all of the Scots, Izzy is the most welcoming to Dempsey. Hiring a boat and crew, Dempsey begins his exploration. This greatly displeases the bailiff (Ian Holm) but the lawman can do little to stop the efforts. As time goes on, no monster does appear, so Dempsey is soon ready to go back to the States. However, one day, Izzy reveals some secrets, big ones. Also, Laura, despite her outward dislike for Dempsey, may, in fact, be attracted to the brash American. Is there romance ahead? First, this film has a terrific setting, the beautiful country around Loch Ness. If you always wishes to go to Scotland but, have little money and big flying anxieties, you will be enchanted with the view. Then, the main actors are quite good, with Danson doing a variation of his smug humor and Richardson looking great and sporting a fine accent. Holm, Graham and all of the others support them nicely. The production also features fine costumes, an arresting script, gorgeous photography and a steady direction. In short, look for Loch, you fans of romance and family-friendly features. It's lovely.

    As the title would suggest "Loch Ness" explores the possibility of the Loch Ness monster, at least on the surface. Ted Danson plays a disillusioned cryptozoologist who is sent on assignment to Loch Ness, Scotland, to disprove the mythical creature's existence. With the assistance of a clairvoyant girl (Kirsty Graham) he discovers many life-changing things. If you're remotely interested in cryptozoology "Loch Ness" is a must. Despite the fact that the story is predictable, this is a very well-made film. It was filmed in 1994 on location in Scotland and England. Although it was primed for theatrical release and released as such in Europe, in America it was ultimately decided to release it on network TV in September, 1996, which was probably a good decision. The film has a lot going for it: Ted Danson is perfect as the jaded scientist; Joely Richardson is Beautiful; the little clairvoyant girl is cute and spiritual; the locations are breathtaking; the people are likable and the story touches on important themes that every non-moron can relate to. If you're in the mood for a mindless slasher/monster flick with lots of gore, this isn't the film to see. See "Loch Ness Terror" instead. However, if you care to explore some of life's most vital questions, look no further. Danson has given up on love in the aftermath of a divorce; he's also given up on his life's work, his dream. He's a laughing stock in the scientific community. Note his powerful statement to his Scottish partner at Loch Ness: "I'm a joke. I'm the guy who chases looney tunes and you think I don't wanna find something out there? If I nailed a dinosaur in Loch Ness I would be vindicated a thousand times over. I would have it all back and more. But it's not gonna happen. There's nothing down there, there's nothing up in British Columbia, there's nothing unexplained flying around the skies at night. That's just a wish list to make us feel like there's something more to life than the $#*% we got stuck with." As you can see, the film is more than just cutesy family fare or mindless monster mayhem. The struggle Danson is going through is real and we can all relate to it on some level. We may not be looking for the Loch Ness monster, but we all have dreams; we all hope to discover love in some manner; we all hope to find meaning in life. Unless, of course, we've given up, like Danson's character in the story. Yet, even then, in the blackest pit of anguish & despair there's hope. There are two general views on life: 1.) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And 2.) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it. The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh and spirit. On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life keeps dishing out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give in to the former. This is the struggle Danson faces in the story. He's given up; he's stumbling in the darkness; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade. The little girl is a key factor in his potential deliverance. She is able to see things as they truly are, including beyond the areas of normal perception. Danson says seeing is believing, but the little girl insists that believing in unseen reality is more important than physically seeing, if you know what I mean. If this review sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo you're not ready for this film. Check out "Freddy V.S. Jason Part VI" instead.

    To those who have not seen this movie: I am going to give you a fair warning. If you are looking for a creature feature, if you are looking for a monster movie, if you are looking for the cheap thrills that are stereotypically imagined coming from a movie with a title such as "Loch Ness", you are not going to get any of these. If who want to see the Loch Ness monster plucking people from docks and boats and gorging on them, don't even bother to start, because "Loch Ness" isn't even remotely along those lines. This is not a low-budget horror movie. By contrast, this is a pleasantly sweet, low-key, lighthearted movie magic family's entertainment best suited for audience members between the ages of six and thirteen and with some appeal to limited members of the older generation. As an adult, I enjoyed this delightful, if somewhat flimsy, little independent film. "Loch Ness" is, to a certain extent, not even about the Loch Ness monster. It's really more of a docudrama about the loch itself and the legend of the prehistoric creatures that supposedly dwells beneath its murky surface. The movie stars Ted Danson as a discredited American scientist who has come to Scotland to not find the monster, but, to quote his boss "use the latest technology to prove it's a hoax." Danson himself doesn't believe in the monster even though he's made a name for himself chasing Sasquatch in the Pacific Northwest. While in Scotland, he picks up a research assistant (James Frain) and forms a friendship with the local pub owner (Joely Richardson) and her ubiquitous daughter (Kirsty Graham) who seems to know a little more about the loch than anybody else does. "Loch Ness" is, all in all, a family movie. There is some peril in the movie, but not enough to terrify the younger audience members. It's got the same spirit as "Free Willy" (1993) if "Free Willy" was set on a lake and the whale merely speculated to be there. Again, if you're a monster movie fanatic, stray away, for the attacks and blood and gore and shiny teeth you seek will not be found. The movie really boasts the question many people have: does the monster even exist? And that is the attitude of the picture. If it were a serious monster movie, we'd know right from the start. But it keeps that question going and going and for that reason, I enjoyed it, for it wasn't just another monster tale, because I personally have seen that movie over and over again, such as in another Loch Ness monster tale called "Beyond Loch Ness" in which the creature was revealed to be real after only five minutes of speculation. Performances are quite good. Ted Danson is effective as the troubled, doubtful scientist who feels that he's just driving another nail into his credibility's coffin. James Frain is also good, although he does at times overplay his character, but it is refreshing to see the mentor-student relationship between him and Danson whereas it typically would be a tag team. I also liked Joely Richardson and was especially fond of Kirsty Graham as the mysterious little girl with a secret. And the screen is also aided by the presence of veteran actor Ian Holm as a water bailiff who always seems to watching Danson with a suspicious eye. "Loch Ness" doesn't reach its full potential because of a somewhat flimsy screenplay, with some scenes ending before we hardly even realize they've started. Some of the dialogue is rather poor, some supporting characters just time-wasters, and such, but all in all, it's a simply fine family movie although it will not ring the bells for everybody. I liked it for its sense of wonder and mystery about the loch where this creature may/may not exist (the movie plays that note), I liked it for the performances, I liked it for the beautiful, ear-warming music score by Trevor Jones, the crystal clear cinematography by Clive Tickner, the unique and seldom-explored nature of the ending, and just an overall enthusiastic tone that director John Henderson instilled into this delightful, if flawed family movie.

    A one-of-the-usual family adventure films, where a great secret is explored and solved, only to be hashed "for the greater good". The performances are OK, even if I was bored with the performance of the gifted-lobotomized child (why the intelligent children are always portrayed in films as super-sensitive boring adults?). I was fed up with the ending, where the script immortalizes the concept that the secrets must be reserved, because "scientists are bad and will destroy everything". I didn't notice any people living in caves in the film (in that manner renouncing all the demented outcomes of scientific research). What I really didn't like in this film (and many others) was that the protagonist decides to renounce the professional, economic and even personal benefits he would get by revealing his discovery to the world, for abstract and simple-minded fears (of course, there is ALWAYS an additional romantic reason in this kind of films). As I said earlier, if that was always the case we would be still living in caves. What's so wrong with a film showing a great mystery solved and the consequences of this discovery? Is it that difficult for a writer to figure out a screenplay like that and that's why that every time the solution is hushed?

    Its hard to picture Ted Danson being anyone but Sam from Cheers, but he delivers a good enough performance as the scientist who is lost, a career ruined by his thirst to find the impossible. Joely Richardson's role as the mother is heart warming she plays her role with care, while Kirsty, the young Isabel. The film starts off with the death of a professor whose aim is to find the Loch Ness monster, so another is sent. Dempsey. A man whose accomplishments are great, yet shrouded by his obsession to find the unexplained, Dempsey, who is lost finds more then he bargained for in Scotland. One thing I liked was the scenery, it showed the highlands and beautiful shots of the water; which gives a sense of beauty, mystery and calm. The build up was brilliant, the shots of the calm water, as it is disturbed by something below, the theories.... But the one thing that ruins the film is the uncovering of the Loch Ness monster...I think they should have never shown the creature, it keeps a little more mystery.

    How we laughed at this trite balderdash that was on TV today. Evidently made by some pea-brained Yank nitwit who has spent maybe 3 seconds in Scotland, regaling the entire film with stereotypes. Eating haggis, tartan blankets, stock names - Campbell, Angus...Blah blah. Letting even the youngest child watch this is tantamount to removing all independent thought. How on earth Ian Holm ended up in this garbage is utterly beyond me. The rest of the 'actors\actresses', director and writer, don't give you your day jobs. Worth watching for humour value only. Ben

    I understand that person's comment about it being a kids film and questioning why Aaron Fleming would say such things, but this film is just boring. I was waiting for something to happen throughout and it never did, I expect the 1 award was won for the most money (12 MILLION DOLLARS) spent on travel for one film crew from the US to the UK. I'm not being a snob or saying I hate kids films or fantasy, I love that stuff, but nothing happens and the love story is a bit lame and empty. Ted Danson's alright sometimes in his career but he was wrong for the part and the weak storyline is not there to fill in for the poor acting here. I even watched this when I was younger and I didn't like it. I'm sure stories of things like the Loch Ness interest most people, so I was looking for it to be more about this, you'd think so from the name, but I was just let down. You'd think the whole point of spending so much money on a film called Loch Ness would be to concentrate on this.

    I'm an old romantic, so I enjoyed this successfully executed formula movie. I enjoyed the premise of a burned out idealistic bigfoot researcher being sent to the Scottish boondocks because he needed the job, at the risk of securing his reputation as a myth chaser. Ted Dansen came up with a convincing edginess to his character (but still obviously with a big heart) that was a refreshing addition to his normal comic characterizations. I also love the idea that in some little corner of the boondooks you can stumble on a Scottish fair maiden whose twinkle in the eye can steal your heart. Joely Richardson's character makes you fall in love with her with a toss of her head. The sparring of the characters is good fun. The plot of the movie could have gone several ways; the writers chose to go the "Disney Movie" route, which provides satisfying entertainment for kids, without seriously degrading the by-the-book but convincing romance. A young James Frain shows outstanding appeal and promise as a powerhouse actor in his character as an idealistic and enthusiastic sidekick to Ted Dansen's beast hunter, a fun character to watch. The story is paced and told with an experienced hand; it provided a very pleasant getaway on a winter's afternoon, transporting the viewer to the famous Loch Ness region of Scotland. I think the photography could have been more painterly and mystical, but you get a good eyeful of the dramatic Scottish landscape. The music score is a nice selection of Scottish influenced themes, with the soaring "Rhythm Of My Heart" by Rod Stewart as the final credits roll. So if you're a romantic, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. If not, it will probably be be too formulaic and "Disney-esque" for you.

With the assistance of a clairvoyant girl (Kirsty Graham) he discovers many life-changing things. If you're remotely interested in cryptozoology "Loch Ness" is a must. Despite the fact that the story is predictable, this is a very well-made film. It was filmed in 1994 on location in Scotland and England. Although it was primed for theatrical release and released as such in Europe, in America it was ultimately decided to release it on network TV in September, 1996, which was probably a good decision. The film has a lot going for it: Ted Danson is perfect as the jaded scientist; Joely Richardson is Beautiful; the little clairvoyant girl is cute and spiritual; the locations are breathtaking; the people are likable and the story touches on important themes that every non-moron can relate to. If you're in the mood for a mindless slasher/monster flick with lots of gore, this isn't the film to see. See "Loch Ness Terror" instead. However, if you care to explore some of life's most vital questions, look no further. Danson has given up on love in the aftermath of a divorce; he's also given up on his life's work, his dream. He's a laughing stock in the scientific community. Note his powerful statement to his Scottish partner at Loch Ness: "I'm a joke. I'm the guy who chases looney tunes and you think I don't wanna find something out there? If I nailed a dinosaur in Loch Ness I would be vindicated a thousand times over. I would have it all back and more. But it's not gonna happen. There's nothing down there, there's nothing up in British Columbia, there's nothing unexplained flying around the skies at night. That's just a wish list to make us feel like there's something more to life than the $#*% we got stuck with." As you can see, the film is more than just cutesy family fare or mindless monster mayhem. The struggle Danson is going through is real and we can all relate to it on some level. We may not be looking for the Loch Ness monster, but we all have dreams; we all hope to discover love in some manner; we all hope to find meaning in life. Unless, of course, we've given up, like Danson's character in the story. Yet, even then, in the blackest pit of anguish & despair there's hope. There are two general views on life: 1.) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And 2.) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it. The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh and spirit. On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life keeps dishing out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give in to the former. This is the struggle Danson faces in the story. He's given up; he's stumbling in the darkness; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade. The little girl is a key factor in his potential deliverance. She is able to see things as they truly are, including beyond the areas of normal perception. Danson says seeing is believing, but the little girl insists that believing in unseen reality is more important than physically seeing, if you know what I mean. If this review sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo you're not ready for this film. Check out "Freddy V.S. Jason Part VI" instead.

    To those who have not seen this movie: I am going to give you a fair warning. If you are looking for a creature feature, if you are looking for a monster movie, if you are looking for the cheap thrills that are stereotypically imagined coming from a movie with a title such as "Loch Ness", you are not going to get any of these. If who want to see the Loch Ness monster plucking people from docks and boats and gorging on them, don't even bother to start, because "Loch Ness" isn't even remotely along those lines. This is not a low-budget horror movie. By contrast, this is a pleasantly sweet, low-key, lighthearted movie magic family's entertainment best suited for audience members between the ages of six and thirteen and with some appeal to limited members of the older generation. As an adult, I enjoyed this delightful, if somewhat flimsy, little independent film. "Loch Ness" is, to a certain extent, not even about the Loch Ness monster. It's really more of a docudrama about the loch itself and the legend of the prehistoric creatures that supposedly dwells beneath its murky surface. The movie stars Ted Danson as a discredited American scientist who has come to Scotland to not find the monster, but, to quote his boss "use the latest technology to prove it's a hoax." Danson himself doesn't believe in the monster even though he's made a name for himself chasing Sasquatch in the Pacific Northwest. While in Scotland, he picks up a research assistant (James Frain) and forms a friendship with the local pub owner (Joely Richardson) and her ubiquitous daughter (Kirsty Graham) who seems to know a little more about the loch than anybody else does. "Loch Ness" is, all in all, a family movie. There is some peril in the movie, but not enough to terrify the younger audience members. It's got the same spirit as "Free Willy" (1993) if "Free Willy" was set on a lake and the whale merely speculated to be there. Again, if you're a monster movie fanatic, stray away, for the attacks and blood and gore and shiny teeth you seek will not be found. The movie really boasts the question many people have: does the monster even exist? And that is the attitude of the picture. If it were a serious monster movie, we'd know right from the start. But it keeps that question going and going and for that reason, I enjoyed it, for it wasn't just another monster tale, because I personally have seen that movie over and over again, such as in another Loch Ness monster tale called "Beyond Loch Ness" in which the creature was revealed to be real after only five minutes of speculation. Performances are quite good. Ted Danson is effective as the troubled, doubtful scientist who feels that he's just driving another nail into his credibility's coffin. James Frain is also good, although he does at times overplay his character, but it is refreshing to see the mentor-student relationship between him and Danson whereas it typically would be a tag team. I also liked Joely Richardson and was especially fond of Kirsty Graham as the mysterious little girl with a secret. And the screen is also aided by the presence of veteran actor Ian Holm as a water bailiff who always seems to watching Danson with a suspicious eye. "Loch Ness" doesn't reach its full potential because of a somewhat flimsy screenplay, with some scenes ending before we hardly even realize they've started. Some of the dialogue is rather poor, some supporting characters just time-wasters, and such, but all in all, it's a simply fine family movie although it will not ring the bells for everybody. I liked it for its sense of wonder and mystery about the loch where this creature may/may not exist (the movie plays that note), I liked it for the performances, I liked it for the beautiful, ear-warming music score by Trevor Jones, the crystal clear cinematography by Clive Tickner, the unique and seldom-explored nature of the ending, and just an overall enthusiastic tone that director John Henderson instilled into this delightful, if flawed family movie.

    A one-of-the-usual family adventure films, where a great secret is explored and solved, only to be hashed "for the greater good". The performances are OK, even if I was bored with the performance of the gifted-lobotomized child (why the intelligent children are always portrayed in films as super-sensitive boring adults?). I was fed up with the ending, where the script immortalizes the concept that the secrets must be reserved, because "scientists are bad and will destroy everything". I didn't notice any people living in caves in the film (in that manner renouncing all the demented outcomes of scientific research). What I really didn't like in this film (and many others) was that the protagonist decides to renounce the professional, economic and even personal benefits he would get by revealing his discovery to the world, for abstract and simple-minded fears (of course, there is ALWAYS an additional romantic reason in this kind of films). As I said earlier, if that was always the case we would be still living in caves. What's so wrong with a film showing a great mystery solved and the consequences of this discovery? Is it that difficult for a writer to figure out a screenplay like that and that's why that every time the solution is hushed?

    Its hard to picture Ted Danson being anyone but Sam from Cheers, but he delivers a good enough performance as the scientist who is lost, a career ruined by his thirst to find the impossible. Joely Richardson's role as the mother is heart warming she plays her role with care, while Kirsty, the young Isabel. The film starts off with the death of a professor whose aim is to find the Loch Ness monster, so another is sent. Dempsey. A man whose accomplishments are great, yet shrouded by his obsession to find the unexplained, Dempsey, who is lost finds more then he bargained for in Scotland. One thing I liked was the scenery, it showed the highlands and beautiful shots of the water; which gives a sense of beauty, mystery and calm. The build up was brilliant, the shots of the calm water, as it is disturbed by something below, the theories.... But the one thing that ruins the film is the uncovering of the Loch Ness monster...I think they should have never shown the creature, it keeps a little more mystery.

    How we laughed at this trite balderdash that was on TV today. Evidently made by some pea-brained Yank nitwit who has spent maybe 3 seconds in Scotland, regaling the entire film with stereotypes. Eating haggis, tartan blankets, stock names - Campbell, Angus...Blah blah. Letting even the youngest child watch this is tantamount to removing all independent thought. How on earth Ian Holm ended up in this garbage is utterly beyond me. The rest of the 'actors\actresses', director and writer, don't give you your day jobs. Worth watching for humour value only. Ben

    I understand that person's comment about it being a kids film and questioning why Aaron Fleming would say such things, but this film is just boring. I was waiting for something to happen throughout and it never did, I expect the 1 award was won for the most money (12 MILLION DOLLARS) spent on travel for one film crew from the US to the UK. I'm not being a snob or saying I hate kids films or fantasy, I love that stuff, but nothing happens and the love story is a bit lame and empty. Ted Danson's alright sometimes in his career but he was wrong for the part and the weak storyline is not there to fill in for the poor acting here. I even watched this when I was younger and I didn't like it. I'm sure stories of things like the Loch Ness interest most people, so I was looking for it to be more about this, you'd think so from the name, but I was just let down. You'd think the whole point of spending so much money on a film called Loch Ness would be to concentrate on this.

    I'm an old romantic, so I enjoyed this successfully executed formula movie. I enjoyed the premise of a burned out idealistic bigfoot researcher being sent to the Scottish boondocks because he needed the job, at the risk of securing his reputation as a myth chaser. Ted Dansen came up with a convincing edginess to his character (but still obviously with a big heart) that was a refreshing addition to his normal comic characterizations. I also love the idea that in some little corner of the boondooks you can stumble on a Scottish fair maiden whose twinkle in the eye can steal your heart. Joely Richardson's character makes you fall in love with her with a toss of her head. The sparring of the characters is good fun. The plot of the movie could have gone several ways; the writers chose to go the "Disney Movie" route, which provides satisfying entertainment for kids, without seriously degrading the by-the-book but convincing romance. A young James Frain shows outstanding appeal and promise as a powerhouse actor in his character as an idealistic and enthusiastic sidekick to Ted Dansen's beast hunter, a fun character to watch. The story is paced and told with an experienced hand; it provided a very pleasant getaway on a winter's afternoon, transporting the viewer to the famous Loch Ness region of Scotland. I think the photography could have been more painterly and mystical, but you get a good eyeful of the dramatic Scottish landscape. The music score is a nice selection of Scottish influenced themes, with the soaring "Rhythm Of My Heart" by Rod Stewart as the final credits roll. So if you're a romantic, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. If not, it will probably be be too formulaic and "Disney-esque" for you.

    If you're happy to suspend your disbelief for the duration then this is for you. I'd never heard of it before it popped up on TV yesterday and I figured I liked Ted Danson in Cheers and Joly Richardson isn't exactly chopped liver so I'll watch the first reel and see what happens. Okay, forget looking for the monster if I thought there was a lady as lovely Joley Richardson walking around loose in a small Scottish village I'd light out for bonnie Scotland in jig-time. As several posters have remarked here this is a genuine feel-good entry, sort of Disney-lite, with no swearing, no violence to speak of and an offbeat love story thrown in - in fact the girl bringing her single mom together with a prospect she, the girl has picked out is hardly new and I can trace it back to Natalie Wood brokering a romance between screen mum Maureen O'Hara and husband/stepfather material John Payne in the original Miracle on 34th Street but it's no worse for that.

    Loch Ness is directed by John Henderson and written by John Fusco. It stars Ted Danson, Joely Richardson, Ian Holm, Kirsty Graham and James Frain. Music is scored by Trevor Jones and cinematography is by Clive Tickner. Plot sees Danson as Zoologist Jonathan Dempsey, who has now become something of a joke in his field after a failed "beastie hunt" for the Yeti. In the last chance saloon, he's packed off by his superiors to debunk the Loch Ness Monster legend, where hardly enthused anyway, he finds a small community unwelcome to his being there. After finally booking into a small inn run by single mother Laura McFetridge (Richardson) Dempsey forms a warm relationship with Laura's nine year old daughter, Isabel (Graham), who just may hold the key to the mystery of Loch Ness. Once it was made available for viewing it struggled to gain any significant support, both by critics and film fans alike. Caught in the 1990's creature feature slipstream created by Jurassic Park, hopes were high for a very different type of Loch Ness Monster movie. Nobody, except for the film makers, were quite prepared for what type of film Loch Ness is. Henderson's film is a human interest story first and foremost, one that has the Loch Ness Monster as its backdrop. It is driven by a mismatched (developing) love story, yet still has enough about it to raise the pertinent question that crowns the story, namely why? And should we? Solve the Loch Ness Monster mystery. It's all very simple and low-key, where any expectation of an FX extravaganza will lead you only to a big disappointment. Helps, too, if you kind of want to believe in the fantastical, like a bit of whimsy with your film supper. An insult often used to beat it with is that it copies Local Hero's template. What is wrong with that? Since Local Hero itself is a charming human fable set in similar gorgeous locale, why not have that delightful film as a marker? In fact Loch Ness is more family friendly, adult enough for the discerning grown up, whilst beguiling the kiddies too. And lets rejoice the sparse use of special effects, what we get is brief, and dare I say it? Magical. Fusco's script is also witty, with much fun mined from Danson's fish out of water portrayal as he finds himself at odds with everyone except the Nessie keen assistant played with wide eyed energy by Frain. The rest of the cast are roundly great as well, Danson (affable supreme), Richardson (quality Scottish accent), Holm (grumpy curmudgeon) and Graham (one of the most natural and unfussy child performances ever), lead the way. While good secondary support comes from a barking mad Keith Allen and Nick Brimble as the self appointed love rival for Laura's attentions. Bolstering the film is a majestic score from Jones, with the expected Celtic harmonies neatly sitting along side the more brassy and keyboard thrusts as the narrative hits its peaks. The synth and string arrangement that accompanies "Nessie" is simply beautiful and the reason why this particular writer had to buy the score. Although the Highland/Lochs locations used for filming are to die for, the film needed a better cinematographer than Tickner. He's good on something like sci-fi trasher Split Second, where he gets away with washed out apocalyptic colours, but here his photography is often murky and the sumptuous colours of the scenery never boom out from the screen. He does, however, know how to light a pretty face, the beautiful Richardson benefiting greatly here. With a big human heart and awash with family friendly mysticism, Loch Ness is a lovely picture. Thankfully for those who now know what to expect, it's a mile away from being a creature feature. 8.5/10

    Dempsey (Ted Danson) is a sort of photojournalist of the weird happenings on planet earth. Having fallen on somewhat hard times, he, nevertheless, is reluctant to attempt his next assignment. The boss directs him to Scotland, where he is to use modern technology to PROVE once and for all that there is no Nessie Monster. There is no real choice but for Dempsey to get on a plane. When he lands, he almost drives over a pretty local lady, Laura (Joely Richardson). In short order, he finds out that she has the only rooming house and, after some begging, she lets him a room. Also in the house is her beautiful young daughter, Isabella (Kirsty Graham). Of all of the Scots, Izzy is the most welcoming to Dempsey. Hiring a boat and crew, Dempsey begins his exploration. This greatly displeases the bailiff (Ian Holm) but the lawman can do little to stop the efforts. As time goes on, no monster does appear, so Dempsey is soon ready to go back to the States. However, one day, Izzy reveals some secrets, big ones. Also, Laura, despite her outward dislike for Dempsey, may, in fact, be attracted to the brash American. Is there romance ahead? First, this film has a terrific setting, the beautiful country around Loch Ness. If you always wishes to go to Scotland but, have little money and big flying anxieties, you will be enchanted with the view. Then, the main actors are quite good, with Danson doing a variation of his smug humor and Richardson looking great and sporting a fine accent. Holm, Graham and all of the others support them nicely. The production also features fine costumes, an arresting script, gorgeous photography and a steady direction. In short, look for Loch, you fans of romance and family-friendly features. It's lovely.

A man whose accomplishments are great, yet shrouded by his obsession to find the unexplained, Dempsey, who is lost finds more then he bargained for in Scotland. One thing I liked was the scenery, it showed the highlands and beautiful shots of the water; which gives a sense of beauty, mystery and calm. The build up was brilliant, the shots of the calm water, as it is disturbed by something below, the theories.... But the one thing that ruins the film is the uncovering of the Loch Ness monster...I think they should have never shown the creature, it keeps a little more mystery.

    How we laughed at this trite balderdash that was on TV today. Evidently made by some pea-brained Yank nitwit who has spent maybe 3 seconds in Scotland, regaling the entire film with stereotypes. Eating haggis, tartan blankets, stock names - Campbell, Angus...Blah blah. Letting even the youngest child watch this is tantamount to removing all independent thought. How on earth Ian Holm ended up in this garbage is utterly beyond me. The rest of the 'actors\actresses', director and writer, don't give you your day jobs. Worth watching for humour value only. Ben

    I understand that person's comment about it being a kids film and questioning why Aaron Fleming would say such things, but this film is just boring. I was waiting for something to happen throughout and it never did, I expect the 1 award was won for the most money (12 MILLION DOLLARS) spent on travel for one film crew from the US to the UK. I'm not being a snob or saying I hate kids films or fantasy, I love that stuff, but nothing happens and the love story is a bit lame and empty. Ted Danson's alright sometimes in his career but he was wrong for the part and the weak storyline is not there to fill in for the poor acting here. I even watched this when I was younger and I didn't like it. I'm sure stories of things like the Loch Ness interest most people, so I was looking for it to be more about this, you'd think so from the name, but I was just let down. You'd think the whole point of spending so much money on a film called Loch Ness would be to concentrate on this.

    I'm an old romantic, so I enjoyed this successfully executed formula movie. I enjoyed the premise of a burned out idealistic bigfoot researcher being sent to the Scottish boondocks because he needed the job, at the risk of securing his reputation as a myth chaser. Ted Dansen came up with a convincing edginess to his character (but still obviously with a big heart) that was a refreshing addition to his normal comic characterizations. I also love the idea that in some little corner of the boondooks you can stumble on a Scottish fair maiden whose twinkle in the eye can steal your heart. Joely Richardson's character makes you fall in love with her with a toss of her head. The sparring of the characters is good fun. The plot of the movie could have gone several ways; the writers chose to go the "Disney Movie" route, which provides satisfying entertainment for kids, without seriously degrading the by-the-book but convincing romance. A young James Frain shows outstanding appeal and promise as a powerhouse actor in his character as an idealistic and enthusiastic sidekick to Ted Dansen's beast hunter, a fun character to watch. The story is paced and told with an experienced hand; it provided a very pleasant getaway on a winter's afternoon, transporting the viewer to the famous Loch Ness region of Scotland. I think the photography could have been more painterly and mystical, but you get a good eyeful of the dramatic Scottish landscape. The music score is a nice selection of Scottish influenced themes, with the soaring "Rhythm Of My Heart" by Rod Stewart as the final credits roll. So if you're a romantic, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. If not, it will probably be be too formulaic and "Disney-esque" for you.
