    Donnie Brasco is a solid, well acted, smartly written crime drama starring woefully miscast Johnny Depp and always amazing Al Pacino. It's a based on a true story about which I know next to nothing so I can't really vouch whether it's very faithful or a complete fabrication. As far as the film stands, it's good and the only real letdown was Johnny Depp. He doesn't belong in a movie where he has to play someone who is a everyman or any form of normal. As stated before in my reviews, Johnny Depp works best when he plays characters that are strange, eccentric and downright crazy. Watch Ed Wood or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to understand where I'm coming from. Aside from that, Donnie Brasco features good performances, good direction and great period setting. You can never go wrong with 70's and Al Pacino... If you enjoy quality filmmaking and can appreciate a film that wants to tell a story about characters, you can't go wrong with Donnie Brasco. It's by no means perfect and hardly the best entry in the genre of American gangster films, but it's a really good one.

    As an undercover officer, staying in disguise often entails becoming one of the criminals. Donnie Brasco offers this unique perspective, and sheds light on the relatable aspects of life in the mafia as he appears to be more criminal than cop. This movie was excellent. Enthralling viewers from the beginning with a view of the daily life in the mob to how operations work; this film is truly a testament to good cinema since it reveals a part of crime life that many people seem not to understand. From holidays to heists, this movie captures the essence of what it means to be a mafioso, and how one is affected from an emotional and physical standpoint. The casting in Donnie Brasco is terrific. With Al Pacino once again delivering as a patron and Johnny Depp playing the prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the pair in crime manage to grab viewers' hearts all the while committing murders and other foul acts. This movie, being based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone, is one of the greater mafia movies, and is one that I highly recommend.

    This movie maybe the some kind of mafia movie.Since This movie was released all after these years whenever I watched the new time movies I can easily realize a lot of famous movie about mafia life in America absolutely has been inspired by this movie.Although actors' great performs I think the scenario was a little basic.I hope this movie more complicated and inspiring and also a movie which can make me more surprised.Although this, I need to say something about actors. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are the great actors,I can see it one more time.And in this movie you can not get avoid their fascinating performs.If I need to say something about the end,all of these things there should be more touching.Actually Ä± felt a little disappointment in the end.

    Donnie Brasco is a fantastic movie with a very well thought out and clever story line and a very talented cast.Johnny Depp and Al Pacino both did a fantastic job and you can tell they both know each other well as there is great chemistry between each other in this movie.I found that the story kind of dragged out a bit and that the direction was a bit depressing but it is still very enjoyable.If you are a fan of mafia movies like The Godfather or Goodfellas,I would definitely recommend you see this movie. An undercover agent (Johnny Depp) starts to bond with Lefty (Al Pacino),a mob boss,and his role as a gangster starts to become more than just an undercover disguise.

    Another reviewer has said it is Pacino's best. I can understand why. Here he turns down the volume and we can hear every note. Its a beautiful, subtle performance. I feel sorry for Depp. In any other film with any other actor it would've been his film but unfortunately Pacino steals every scene his in. Lefty (Pacino) is a small-time hood forever being passed over. Donnie Brasco (Depp) is the undercover FBI agent who Pacino befriends and vouches for to his ultimate doom. Every scene with Pacino in should be watched by every aspiring film actor (and most established ones!) to see how its done. If this sounds like a love-letter to Pacino at the expense of the rest of the cast well it is. And the supporting cast are perfect as well - Heche as Brasco's suffering wife, Madsen as Pacino's boss, Bruno Kirby as one of the gang. I could list every one. Also credit must go to the director Mike Newell for making me forgive him for Hugh Grant's career with this film. Some people say this is too similar to "Goodfellas" and indeed the release was delayed and the casting changed due to that Scorsese classic. But I say "Donnie Brasco" is the anti-Goodfellas - the wiseguys here are a bit too low rent/nickel and dime. And Pacino gives us the anti-Godfather. And when films are this good there's room for both in this world.

    The first time I watched Donnie Brasco, I did so with a bit of trepidation. The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama. The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld. The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character. Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention. So, if you haven't seen it and you're up for a crime drama, I can recommend Donnie Brasco without reservations. My rating is 8/10.

    It is based on true events. FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), must temporarily leave his family and impersonating a gangster: the jeweler "Donnie Brasco". However, to be accepted by the mobsters must prove their loyalty and show their ability to commit crimes. It aims to investigate the activities of the Bonanno clan and for that, you gain confidence "Lefty Ruggiero" (Al Pacino), a cynical than ever declining gunman gained access to the upper echelons of power. This is another devastating vision of the urban jungle and its episodes criminals and gangsters, who has a formidable direction by Mike Newell, which transfers a perfectly told story from beginning to end in the style of the masters (Scorseese and Coppola). It's a film made with a steady, rolling streams overflowing sobriety and magnificence. It is a memorable and remarkable true story, with actors duel between Depp and Pacino, in which Pacino wins though Deep ago one of his best performances. This is a huge and wonderful story told and excellently directed wisely. This was the last great movie about gangsters, were it not for "The Departed" 2006, by master Scorsese, who incidentally shares with this film over a common point in the argument. The script is a delight, is impressive as grabs you from the start, and how do you make a tremendous sympathy for the loser of "Lefty" (a gangster that nobody respects). It happens then the story without too much haste to reach a predictable but brutal end. I think the film is an interesting approach to the world, to the sphere of "street-mafia", not to the highest levels of "business. Could take as reference of such films to" Goodfellas "1990 M. Scorsese, or Miller's Crossing "Coen Brothers, or" A Bronx Tale "1993 Robert De Niro, but in this film you omit the period in which the young protagonists are integrated into" families ". The film has a very disgruntled mixed feelings: hate, love, loyalty, lying, etc.. And what is more surprising reaches the end because in many films of "The Maria" ... always leave with a halo of mystery (as if there had not just the story), but in this film concludes rudely. The two notable scenes in this film are superb: the first on the boat, after the conversation between "Donnie" and "Sonny Black", the face of Al Pacino is a poem of expression, along with music and cause tremendous sadness. The second is when "Lefty" is at home watching a documentary about animals and they call him to "appear.", and how he emerges from his personal belongings and deposited in a drawer Who likes the genre about "La Mafia", not to be missed? It is one of those movies that one would like to see several times, which it has an impressive staging, sometimes overwhelming, and one of the best performances of Al Pacino, who although makes very minor gangster, his presence fills the screen.

    Well where to start...this is my first review and i specially made this account to wrtie one for this movie..... one of the best Alpacinos movies and undoubtedly the best movie of Johhny Deps whole life... This movie touched my heart, The Acting,the direction,the dialougues everything was mind boggling.... The story grabs your soul inside the movie and ties u hard and you cannt leave ur place obviously because its not one of those fully action packed fast paced movies that u see everyday. So relax before start watching it. The relation between donnie and lefty is definitely very emotional and i think there are very less movies that have touched my heart this much before... I recommend it very strongly.

    I watched this movie the other night and I really liked it. It was no goodfellas or casino but it was definitely still a great watch. Johnny Depp should stick to movies like this and blow he is such a good actor when given a role like this. This is a true story so it adds to the intensity and starring Depp and Pacino the acting is very good and believable. This movie is about an undercover cop (Depp) who has to infilitrate a mob family particularly to find out more about the mob boss(Pacino) he ends up being undercover for years and eventually starts to bond with these mod members. This movie was really good and it being a true story made it that much more amazing. It was very entertaining and the great performances sucked you right in.

    With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man (Lefty Ruggiero). Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent "Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone") and Michael Madsen ("Sonny Black") also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche ("Maggie Pistone") was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.

    With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man (Lefty Ruggiero). Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent "Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone") and Michael Madsen ("Sonny Black") also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche ("Maggie Pistone") was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.

    Donnie Brasco is a solid, well acted, smartly written crime drama starring woefully miscast Johnny Depp and always amazing Al Pacino. It's a based on a true story about which I know next to nothing so I can't really vouch whether it's very faithful or a complete fabrication. As far as the film stands, it's good and the only real letdown was Johnny Depp. He doesn't belong in a movie where he has to play someone who is a everyman or any form of normal. As stated before in my reviews, Johnny Depp works best when he plays characters that are strange, eccentric and downright crazy. Watch Ed Wood or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to understand where I'm coming from. Aside from that, Donnie Brasco features good performances, good direction and great period setting. You can never go wrong with 70's and Al Pacino... If you enjoy quality filmmaking and can appreciate a film that wants to tell a story about characters, you can't go wrong with Donnie Brasco. It's by no means perfect and hardly the best entry in the genre of American gangster films, but it's a really good one.

    As an undercover officer, staying in disguise often entails becoming one of the criminals. Donnie Brasco offers this unique perspective, and sheds light on the relatable aspects of life in the mafia as he appears to be more criminal than cop. This movie was excellent. Enthralling viewers from the beginning with a view of the daily life in the mob to how operations work; this film is truly a testament to good cinema since it reveals a part of crime life that many people seem not to understand. From holidays to heists, this movie captures the essence of what it means to be a mafioso, and how one is affected from an emotional and physical standpoint. The casting in Donnie Brasco is terrific. With Al Pacino once again delivering as a patron and Johnny Depp playing the prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the pair in crime manage to grab viewers' hearts all the while committing murders and other foul acts. This movie, being based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone, is one of the greater mafia movies, and is one that I highly recommend.

    This movie maybe the some kind of mafia movie.Since This movie was released all after these years whenever I watched the new time movies I can easily realize a lot of famous movie about mafia life in America absolutely has been inspired by this movie.Although actors' great performs I think the scenario was a little basic.I hope this movie more complicated and inspiring and also a movie which can make me more surprised.Although this, I need to say something about actors. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are the great actors,I can see it one more time.And in this movie you can not get avoid their fascinating performs.If I need to say something about the end,all of these things there should be more touching.Actually Ä± felt a little disappointment in the end.

    Donnie Brasco is a fantastic movie with a very well thought out and clever story line and a very talented cast.Johnny Depp and Al Pacino both did a fantastic job and you can tell they both know each other well as there is great chemistry between each other in this movie.I found that the story kind of dragged out a bit and that the direction was a bit depressing but it is still very enjoyable.If you are a fan of mafia movies like The Godfather or Goodfellas,I would definitely recommend you see this movie. An undercover agent (Johnny Depp) starts to bond with Lefty (Al Pacino),a mob boss,and his role as a gangster starts to become more than just an undercover disguise.

    Another reviewer has said it is Pacino's best. I can understand why. Here he turns down the volume and we can hear every note. Its a beautiful, subtle performance. I feel sorry for Depp. In any other film with any other actor it would've been his film but unfortunately Pacino steals every scene his in. Lefty (Pacino) is a small-time hood forever being passed over. Donnie Brasco (Depp) is the undercover FBI agent who Pacino befriends and vouches for to his ultimate doom. Every scene with Pacino in should be watched by every aspiring film actor (and most established ones!) to see how its done. If this sounds like a love-letter to Pacino at the expense of the rest of the cast well it is. And the supporting cast are perfect as well - Heche as Brasco's suffering wife, Madsen as Pacino's boss, Bruno Kirby as one of the gang. I could list every one. Also credit must go to the director Mike Newell for making me forgive him for Hugh Grant's career with this film. Some people say this is too similar to "Goodfellas" and indeed the release was delayed and the casting changed due to that Scorsese classic. But I say "Donnie Brasco" is the anti-Goodfellas - the wiseguys here are a bit too low rent/nickel and dime. And Pacino gives us the anti-Godfather. And when films are this good there's room for both in this world.

    The first time I watched Donnie Brasco, I did so with a bit of trepidation. The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama. The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld. The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character. Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention. So, if you haven't seen it and you're up for a crime drama, I can recommend Donnie Brasco without reservations. My rating is 8/10.

    It is based on true events. FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), must temporarily leave his family and impersonating a gangster: the jeweler "Donnie Brasco". However, to be accepted by the mobsters must prove their loyalty and show their ability to commit crimes. It aims to investigate the activities of the Bonanno clan and for that, you gain confidence "Lefty Ruggiero" (Al Pacino), a cynical than ever declining gunman gained access to the upper echelons of power. This is another devastating vision of the urban jungle and its episodes criminals and gangsters, who has a formidable direction by Mike Newell, which transfers a perfectly told story from beginning to end in the style of the masters (Scorseese and Coppola). It's a film made with a steady, rolling streams overflowing sobriety and magnificence. It is a memorable and remarkable true story, with actors duel between Depp and Pacino, in which Pacino wins though Deep ago one of his best performances. This is a huge and wonderful story told and excellently directed wisely. This was the last great movie about gangsters, were it not for "The Departed" 2006, by master Scorsese, who incidentally shares with this film over a common point in the argument. The script is a delight, is impressive as grabs you from the start, and how do you make a tremendous sympathy for the loser of "Lefty" (a gangster that nobody respects). It happens then the story without too much haste to reach a predictable but brutal end. I think the film is an interesting approach to the world, to the sphere of "street-mafia", not to the highest levels of "business. Could take as reference of such films to" Goodfellas "1990 M. Scorsese, or Miller's Crossing "Coen Brothers, or" A Bronx Tale "1993 Robert De Niro, but in this film you omit the period in which the young protagonists are integrated into" families ". The film has a very disgruntled mixed feelings: hate, love, loyalty, lying, etc.. And what is more surprising reaches the end because in many films of "The Maria" ... always leave with a halo of mystery (as if there had not just the story), but in this film concludes rudely. The two notable scenes in this film are superb: the first on the boat, after the conversation between "Donnie" and "Sonny Black", the face of Al Pacino is a poem of expression, along with music and cause tremendous sadness. The second is when "Lefty" is at home watching a documentary about animals and they call him to "appear.", and how he emerges from his personal belongings and deposited in a drawer Who likes the genre about "La Mafia", not to be missed? It is one of those movies that one would like to see several times, which it has an impressive staging, sometimes overwhelming, and one of the best performances of Al Pacino, who although makes very minor gangster, his presence fills the screen.

    Well where to start...this is my first review and i specially made this account to wrtie one for this movie..... one of the best Alpacinos movies and undoubtedly the best movie of Johhny Deps whole life... This movie touched my heart, The Acting,the direction,the dialougues everything was mind boggling.... The story grabs your soul inside the movie and ties u hard and you cannt leave ur place obviously because its not one of those fully action packed fast paced movies that u see everyday. So relax before start watching it. The relation between donnie and lefty is definitely very emotional and i think there are very less movies that have touched my heart this much before... I recommend it very strongly.

    I watched this movie the other night and I really liked it. It was no goodfellas or casino but it was definitely still a great watch. Johnny Depp should stick to movies like this and blow he is such a good actor when given a role like this. This is a true story so it adds to the intensity and starring Depp and Pacino the acting is very good and believable. This movie is about an undercover cop (Depp) who has to infilitrate a mob family particularly to find out more about the mob boss(Pacino) he ends up being undercover for years and eventually starts to bond with these mod members. This movie was really good and it being a true story made it that much more amazing. It was very entertaining and the great performances sucked you right in.

    Donnie Brasco is a solid, well acted, smartly written crime drama starring woefully miscast Johnny Depp and always amazing Al Pacino. It's a based on a true story about which I know next to nothing so I can't really vouch whether it's very faithful or a complete fabrication. As far as the film stands, it's good and the only real letdown was Johnny Depp. He doesn't belong in a movie where he has to play someone who is a everyman or any form of normal. As stated before in my reviews, Johnny Depp works best when he plays characters that are strange, eccentric and downright crazy. Watch Ed Wood or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to understand where I'm coming from. Aside from that, Donnie Brasco features good performances, good direction and great period setting. You can never go wrong with 70's and Al Pacino... If you enjoy quality filmmaking and can appreciate a film that wants to tell a story about characters, you can't go wrong with Donnie Brasco. It's by no means perfect and hardly the best entry in the genre of American gangster films, but it's a really good one.

    As an undercover officer, staying in disguise often entails becoming one of the criminals. Donnie Brasco offers this unique perspective, and sheds light on the relatable aspects of life in the mafia as he appears to be more criminal than cop. This movie was excellent. Enthralling viewers from the beginning with a view of the daily life in the mob to how operations work; this film is truly a testament to good cinema since it reveals a part of crime life that many people seem not to understand. From holidays to heists, this movie captures the essence of what it means to be a mafioso, and how one is affected from an emotional and physical standpoint. The casting in Donnie Brasco is terrific. With Al Pacino once again delivering as a patron and Johnny Depp playing the prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the pair in crime manage to grab viewers' hearts all the while committing murders and other foul acts. This movie, being based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone, is one of the greater mafia movies, and is one that I highly recommend.

    This movie maybe the some kind of mafia movie.Since This movie was released all after these years whenever I watched the new time movies I can easily realize a lot of famous movie about mafia life in America absolutely has been inspired by this movie.Although actors' great performs I think the scenario was a little basic.I hope this movie more complicated and inspiring and also a movie which can make me more surprised.Although this, I need to say something about actors. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are the great actors,I can see it one more time.And in this movie you can not get avoid their fascinating performs.If I need to say something about the end,all of these things there should be more touching.Actually Ä± felt a little disappointment in the end.

    Donnie Brasco is a fantastic movie with a very well thought out and clever story line and a very talented cast.Johnny Depp and Al Pacino both did a fantastic job and you can tell they both know each other well as there is great chemistry between each other in this movie.I found that the story kind of dragged out a bit and that the direction was a bit depressing but it is still very enjoyable.If you are a fan of mafia movies like The Godfather or Goodfellas,I would definitely recommend you see this movie. An undercover agent (Johnny Depp) starts to bond with Lefty (Al Pacino),a mob boss,and his role as a gangster starts to become more than just an undercover disguise.

    Another reviewer has said it is Pacino's best. I can understand why. Here he turns down the volume and we can hear every note. Its a beautiful, subtle performance. I feel sorry for Depp. In any other film with any other actor it would've been his film but unfortunately Pacino steals every scene his in. Lefty (Pacino) is a small-time hood forever being passed over. Donnie Brasco (Depp) is the undercover FBI agent who Pacino befriends and vouches for to his ultimate doom. Every scene with Pacino in should be watched by every aspiring film actor (and most established ones!) to see how its done. If this sounds like a love-letter to Pacino at the expense of the rest of the cast well it is. And the supporting cast are perfect as well - Heche as Brasco's suffering wife, Madsen as Pacino's boss, Bruno Kirby as one of the gang. I could list every one. Also credit must go to the director Mike Newell for making me forgive him for Hugh Grant's career with this film. Some people say this is too similar to "Goodfellas" and indeed the release was delayed and the casting changed due to that Scorsese classic. But I say "Donnie Brasco" is the anti-Goodfellas - the wiseguys here are a bit too low rent/nickel and dime. And Pacino gives us the anti-Godfather. And when films are this good there's room for both in this world.

    The first time I watched Donnie Brasco, I did so with a bit of trepidation. The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama. The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld. The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character. Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention. So, if you haven't seen it and you're up for a crime drama, I can recommend Donnie Brasco without reservations. My rating is 8/10.

    It is based on true events. FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), must temporarily leave his family and impersonating a gangster: the jeweler "Donnie Brasco". However, to be accepted by the mobsters must prove their loyalty and show their ability to commit crimes. It aims to investigate the activities of the Bonanno clan and for that, you gain confidence "Lefty Ruggiero" (Al Pacino), a cynical than ever declining gunman gained access to the upper echelons of power. This is another devastating vision of the urban jungle and its episodes criminals and gangsters, who has a formidable direction by Mike Newell, which transfers a perfectly told story from beginning to end in the style of the masters (Scorseese and Coppola). It's a film made with a steady, rolling streams overflowing sobriety and magnificence. It is a memorable and remarkable true story, with actors duel between Depp and Pacino, in which Pacino wins though Deep ago one of his best performances. This is a huge and wonderful story told and excellently directed wisely. This was the last great movie about gangsters, were it not for "The Departed" 2006, by master Scorsese, who incidentally shares with this film over a common point in the argument. The script is a delight, is impressive as grabs you from the start, and how do you make a tremendous sympathy for the loser of "Lefty" (a gangster that nobody respects). It happens then the story without too much haste to reach a predictable but brutal end. I think the film is an interesting approach to the world, to the sphere of "street-mafia", not to the highest levels of "business. Could take as reference of such films to" Goodfellas "1990 M. Scorsese, or Miller's Crossing "Coen Brothers, or" A Bronx Tale "1993 Robert De Niro, but in this film you omit the period in which the young protagonists are integrated into" families ". The film has a very disgruntled mixed feelings: hate, love, loyalty, lying, etc.. And what is more surprising reaches the end because in many films of "The Maria" ... always leave with a halo of mystery (as if there had not just the story), but in this film concludes rudely. The two notable scenes in this film are superb: the first on the boat, after the conversation between "Donnie" and "Sonny Black", the face of Al Pacino is a poem of expression, along with music and cause tremendous sadness. The second is when "Lefty" is at home watching a documentary about animals and they call him to "appear.", and how he emerges from his personal belongings and deposited in a drawer Who likes the genre about "La Mafia", not to be missed? It is one of those movies that one would like to see several times, which it has an impressive staging, sometimes overwhelming, and one of the best performances of Al Pacino, who although makes very minor gangster, his presence fills the screen.

    Well where to start...this is my first review and i specially made this account to wrtie one for this movie..... one of the best Alpacinos movies and undoubtedly the best movie of Johhny Deps whole life... This movie touched my heart, The Acting,the direction,the dialougues everything was mind boggling.... The story grabs your soul inside the movie and ties u hard and you cannt leave ur place obviously because its not one of those fully action packed fast paced movies that u see everyday. So relax before start watching it. The relation between donnie and lefty is definitely very emotional and i think there are very less movies that have touched my heart this much before... I recommend it very strongly.

    I watched this movie the other night and I really liked it. It was no goodfellas or casino but it was definitely still a great watch. Johnny Depp should stick to movies like this and blow he is such a good actor when given a role like this. This is a true story so it adds to the intensity and starring Depp and Pacino the acting is very good and believable. This movie is about an undercover cop (Depp) who has to infilitrate a mob family particularly to find out more about the mob boss(Pacino) he ends up being undercover for years and eventually starts to bond with these mod members. This movie was really good and it being a true story made it that much more amazing. It was very entertaining and the great performances sucked you right in.

    With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man (Lefty Ruggiero). Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent "Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone") and Michael Madsen ("Sonny Black") also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche ("Maggie Pistone") was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.

    As an undercover officer, staying in disguise often entails becoming one of the criminals. Donnie Brasco offers this unique perspective, and sheds light on the relatable aspects of life in the mafia as he appears to be more criminal than cop. This movie was excellent. Enthralling viewers from the beginning with a view of the daily life in the mob to how operations work; this film is truly a testament to good cinema since it reveals a part of crime life that many people seem not to understand. From holidays to heists, this movie captures the essence of what it means to be a mafioso, and how one is affected from an emotional and physical standpoint. The casting in Donnie Brasco is terrific. With Al Pacino once again delivering as a patron and Johnny Depp playing the prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the pair in crime manage to grab viewers' hearts all the while committing murders and other foul acts. This movie, being based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone, is one of the greater mafia movies, and is one that I highly recommend.

    This movie maybe the some kind of mafia movie.Since This movie was released all after these years whenever I watched the new time movies I can easily realize a lot of famous movie about mafia life in America absolutely has been inspired by this movie.Although actors' great performs I think the scenario was a little basic.I hope this movie more complicated and inspiring and also a movie which can make me more surprised.Although this, I need to say something about actors. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are the great actors,I can see it one more time.And in this movie you can not get avoid their fascinating performs.If I need to say something about the end,all of these things there should be more touching.Actually Ä± felt a little disappointment in the end.

    Donnie Brasco is a fantastic movie with a very well thought out and clever story line and a very talented cast.Johnny Depp and Al Pacino both did a fantastic job and you can tell they both know each other well as there is great chemistry between each other in this movie.I found that the story kind of dragged out a bit and that the direction was a bit depressing but it is still very enjoyable.If you are a fan of mafia movies like The Godfather or Goodfellas,I would definitely recommend you see this movie. An undercover agent (Johnny Depp) starts to bond with Lefty (Al Pacino),a mob boss,and his role as a gangster starts to become more than just an undercover disguise.

    Another reviewer has said it is Pacino's best. I can understand why. Here he turns down the volume and we can hear every note. Its a beautiful, subtle performance. I feel sorry for Depp. In any other film with any other actor it would've been his film but unfortunately Pacino steals every scene his in. Lefty (Pacino) is a small-time hood forever being passed over. Donnie Brasco (Depp) is the undercover FBI agent who Pacino befriends and vouches for to his ultimate doom. Every scene with Pacino in should be watched by every aspiring film actor (and most established ones!) to see how its done. If this sounds like a love-letter to Pacino at the expense of the rest of the cast well it is. And the supporting cast are perfect as well - Heche as Brasco's suffering wife, Madsen as Pacino's boss, Bruno Kirby as one of the gang. I could list every one. Also credit must go to the director Mike Newell for making me forgive him for Hugh Grant's career with this film. Some people say this is too similar to "Goodfellas" and indeed the release was delayed and the casting changed due to that Scorsese classic. But I say "Donnie Brasco" is the anti-Goodfellas - the wiseguys here are a bit too low rent/nickel and dime. And Pacino gives us the anti-Godfather. And when films are this good there's room for both in this world.

    The first time I watched Donnie Brasco, I did so with a bit of trepidation. The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama. The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld. The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character. Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention. So, if you haven't seen it and you're up for a crime drama, I can recommend Donnie Brasco without reservations. My rating is 8/10.

    It is based on true events. FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), must temporarily leave his family and impersonating a gangster: the jeweler "Donnie Brasco". However, to be accepted by the mobsters must prove their loyalty and show their ability to commit crimes. It aims to investigate the activities of the Bonanno clan and for that, you gain confidence "Lefty Ruggiero" (Al Pacino), a cynical than ever declining gunman gained access to the upper echelons of power. This is another devastating vision of the urban jungle and its episodes criminals and gangsters, who has a formidable direction by Mike Newell, which transfers a perfectly told story from beginning to end in the style of the masters (Scorseese and Coppola). It's a film made with a steady, rolling streams overflowing sobriety and magnificence. It is a memorable and remarkable true story, with actors duel between Depp and Pacino, in which Pacino wins though Deep ago one of his best performances. This is a huge and wonderful story told and excellently directed wisely. This was the last great movie about gangsters, were it not for "The Departed" 2006, by master Scorsese, who incidentally shares with this film over a common point in the argument. The script is a delight, is impressive as grabs you from the start, and how do you make a tremendous sympathy for the loser of "Lefty" (a gangster that nobody respects). It happens then the story without too much haste to reach a predictable but brutal end. I think the film is an interesting approach to the world, to the sphere of "street-mafia", not to the highest levels of "business. Could take as reference of such films to" Goodfellas "1990 M. Scorsese, or Miller's Crossing "Coen Brothers, or" A Bronx Tale "1993 Robert De Niro, but in this film you omit the period in which the young protagonists are integrated into" families ". The film has a very disgruntled mixed feelings: hate, love, loyalty, lying, etc.. And what is more surprising reaches the end because in many films of "The Maria" ... always leave with a halo of mystery (as if there had not just the story), but in this film concludes rudely. The two notable scenes in this film are superb: the first on the boat, after the conversation between "Donnie" and "Sonny Black", the face of Al Pacino is a poem of expression, along with music and cause tremendous sadness. The second is when "Lefty" is at home watching a documentary about animals and they call him to "appear.", and how he emerges from his personal belongings and deposited in a drawer Who likes the genre about "La Mafia", not to be missed? It is one of those movies that one would like to see several times, which it has an impressive staging, sometimes overwhelming, and one of the best performances of Al Pacino, who although makes very minor gangster, his presence fills the screen.

    Well where to start...this is my first review and i specially made this account to wrtie one for this movie..... one of the best Alpacinos movies and undoubtedly the best movie of Johhny Deps whole life... This movie touched my heart, The Acting,the direction,the dialougues everything was mind boggling.... The story grabs your soul inside the movie and ties u hard and you cannt leave ur place obviously because its not one of those fully action packed fast paced movies that u see everyday. So relax before start watching it. The relation between donnie and lefty is definitely very emotional and i think there are very less movies that have touched my heart this much before... I recommend it very strongly.

    I watched this movie the other night and I really liked it. It was no goodfellas or casino but it was definitely still a great watch. Johnny Depp should stick to movies like this and blow he is such a good actor when given a role like this. This is a true story so it adds to the intensity and starring Depp and Pacino the acting is very good and believable. This movie is about an undercover cop (Depp) who has to infilitrate a mob family particularly to find out more about the mob boss(Pacino) he ends up being undercover for years and eventually starts to bond with these mod members. This movie was really good and it being a true story made it that much more amazing. It was very entertaining and the great performances sucked you right in.

    With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man (Lefty Ruggiero). Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent "Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone") and Michael Madsen ("Sonny Black") also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche ("Maggie Pistone") was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.

    Donnie Brasco is a solid, well acted, smartly written crime drama starring woefully miscast Johnny Depp and always amazing Al Pacino. It's a based on a true story about which I know next to nothing so I can't really vouch whether it's very faithful or a complete fabrication. As far as the film stands, it's good and the only real letdown was Johnny Depp. He doesn't belong in a movie where he has to play someone who is a everyman or any form of normal. As stated before in my reviews, Johnny Depp works best when he plays characters that are strange, eccentric and downright crazy. Watch Ed Wood or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to understand where I'm coming from. Aside from that, Donnie Brasco features good performances, good direction and great period setting. You can never go wrong with 70's and Al Pacino... If you enjoy quality filmmaking and can appreciate a film that wants to tell a story about characters, you can't go wrong with Donnie Brasco. It's by no means perfect and hardly the best entry in the genre of American gangster films, but it's a really good one.

    This movie maybe the some kind of mafia movie.Since This movie was released all after these years whenever I watched the new time movies I can easily realize a lot of famous movie about mafia life in America absolutely has been inspired by this movie.Although actors' great performs I think the scenario was a little basic.I hope this movie more complicated and inspiring and also a movie which can make me more surprised.Although this, I need to say something about actors. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are the great actors,I can see it one more time.And in this movie you can not get avoid their fascinating performs.If I need to say something about the end,all of these things there should be more touching.Actually Ä± felt a little disappointment in the end.

    Donnie Brasco is a fantastic movie with a very well thought out and clever story line and a very talented cast.Johnny Depp and Al Pacino both did a fantastic job and you can tell they both know each other well as there is great chemistry between each other in this movie.I found that the story kind of dragged out a bit and that the direction was a bit depressing but it is still very enjoyable.If you are a fan of mafia movies like The Godfather or Goodfellas,I would definitely recommend you see this movie. An undercover agent (Johnny Depp) starts to bond with Lefty (Al Pacino),a mob boss,and his role as a gangster starts to become more than just an undercover disguise.

    Another reviewer has said it is Pacino's best. I can understand why. Here he turns down the volume and we can hear every note. Its a beautiful, subtle performance. I feel sorry for Depp. In any other film with any other actor it would've been his film but unfortunately Pacino steals every scene his in. Lefty (Pacino) is a small-time hood forever being passed over. Donnie Brasco (Depp) is the undercover FBI agent who Pacino befriends and vouches for to his ultimate doom. Every scene with Pacino in should be watched by every aspiring film actor (and most established ones!) to see how its done. If this sounds like a love-letter to Pacino at the expense of the rest of the cast well it is. And the supporting cast are perfect as well - Heche as Brasco's suffering wife, Madsen as Pacino's boss, Bruno Kirby as one of the gang. I could list every one. Also credit must go to the director Mike Newell for making me forgive him for Hugh Grant's career with this film. Some people say this is too similar to "Goodfellas" and indeed the release was delayed and the casting changed due to that Scorsese classic. But I say "Donnie Brasco" is the anti-Goodfellas - the wiseguys here are a bit too low rent/nickel and dime. And Pacino gives us the anti-Godfather. And when films are this good there's room for both in this world.

    The first time I watched Donnie Brasco, I did so with a bit of trepidation. The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama. The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld. The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character. Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention. So, if you haven't seen it and you're up for a crime drama, I can recommend Donnie Brasco without reservations. My rating is 8/10.

    It is based on true events. FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), must temporarily leave his family and impersonating a gangster: the jeweler "Donnie Brasco". However, to be accepted by the mobsters must prove their loyalty and show their ability to commit crimes. It aims to investigate the activities of the Bonanno clan and for that, you gain confidence "Lefty Ruggiero" (Al Pacino), a cynical than ever declining gunman gained access to the upper echelons of power. This is another devastating vision of the urban jungle and its episodes criminals and gangsters, who has a formidable direction by Mike Newell, which transfers a perfectly told story from beginning to end in the style of the masters (Scorseese and Coppola). It's a film made with a steady, rolling streams overflowing sobriety and magnificence. It is a memorable and remarkable true story, with actors duel between Depp and Pacino, in which Pacino wins though Deep ago one of his best performances. This is a huge and wonderful story told and excellently directed wisely. This was the last great movie about gangsters, were it not for "The Departed" 2006, by master Scorsese, who incidentally shares with this film over a common point in the argument. The script is a delight, is impressive as grabs you from the start, and how do you make a tremendous sympathy for the loser of "Lefty" (a gangster that nobody respects). It happens then the story without too much haste to reach a predictable but brutal end. I think the film is an interesting approach to the world, to the sphere of "street-mafia", not to the highest levels of "business. Could take as reference of such films to" Goodfellas "1990 M. Scorsese, or Miller's Crossing "Coen Brothers, or" A Bronx Tale "1993 Robert De Niro, but in this film you omit the period in which the young protagonists are integrated into" families ". The film has a very disgruntled mixed feelings: hate, love, loyalty, lying, etc.. And what is more surprising reaches the end because in many films of "The Maria" ... always leave with a halo of mystery (as if there had not just the story), but in this film concludes rudely. The two notable scenes in this film are superb: the first on the boat, after the conversation between "Donnie" and "Sonny Black", the face of Al Pacino is a poem of expression, along with music and cause tremendous sadness. The second is when "Lefty" is at home watching a documentary about animals and they call him to "appear.", and how he emerges from his personal belongings and deposited in a drawer Who likes the genre about "La Mafia", not to be missed? It is one of those movies that one would like to see several times, which it has an impressive staging, sometimes overwhelming, and one of the best performances of Al Pacino, who although makes very minor gangster, his presence fills the screen.

    Well where to start...this is my first review and i specially made this account to wrtie one for this movie..... one of the best Alpacinos movies and undoubtedly the best movie of Johhny Deps whole life... This movie touched my heart, The Acting,the direction,the dialougues everything was mind boggling.... The story grabs your soul inside the movie and ties u hard and you cannt leave ur place obviously because its not one of those fully action packed fast paced movies that u see everyday. So relax before start watching it. The relation between donnie and lefty is definitely very emotional and i think there are very less movies that have touched my heart this much before... I recommend it very strongly.

    I watched this movie the other night and I really liked it. It was no goodfellas or casino but it was definitely still a great watch. Johnny Depp should stick to movies like this and blow he is such a good actor when given a role like this. This is a true story so it adds to the intensity and starring Depp and Pacino the acting is very good and believable. This movie is about an undercover cop (Depp) who has to infilitrate a mob family particularly to find out more about the mob boss(Pacino) he ends up being undercover for years and eventually starts to bond with these mod members. This movie was really good and it being a true story made it that much more amazing. It was very entertaining and the great performances sucked you right in.

    With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man (Lefty Ruggiero). Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent "Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone") and Michael Madsen ("Sonny Black") also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche ("Maggie Pistone") was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.

    Donnie Brasco is a solid, well acted, smartly written crime drama starring woefully miscast Johnny Depp and always amazing Al Pacino. It's a based on a true story about which I know next to nothing so I can't really vouch whether it's very faithful or a complete fabrication. As far as the film stands, it's good and the only real letdown was Johnny Depp. He doesn't belong in a movie where he has to play someone who is a everyman or any form of normal. As stated before in my reviews, Johnny Depp works best when he plays characters that are strange, eccentric and downright crazy. Watch Ed Wood or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to understand where I'm coming from. Aside from that, Donnie Brasco features good performances, good direction and great period setting. You can never go wrong with 70's and Al Pacino... If you enjoy quality filmmaking and can appreciate a film that wants to tell a story about characters, you can't go wrong with Donnie Brasco. It's by no means perfect and hardly the best entry in the genre of American gangster films, but it's a really good one.

    As an undercover officer, staying in disguise often entails becoming one of the criminals. Donnie Brasco offers this unique perspective, and sheds light on the relatable aspects of life in the mafia as he appears to be more criminal than cop. This movie was excellent. Enthralling viewers from the beginning with a view of the daily life in the mob to how operations work; this film is truly a testament to good cinema since it reveals a part of crime life that many people seem not to understand. From holidays to heists, this movie captures the essence of what it means to be a mafioso, and how one is affected from an emotional and physical standpoint. The casting in Donnie Brasco is terrific. With Al Pacino once again delivering as a patron and Johnny Depp playing the prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the pair in crime manage to grab viewers' hearts all the while committing murders and other foul acts. This movie, being based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone, is one of the greater mafia movies, and is one that I highly recommend.
