    Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming. However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

    Really a loving and a moving story. About live in lovers, Sam(Played by the late Patrick Swayze), and Molly(Demi Moore) as they are living in a new apartment. But despite great jobs, he as a banker and she as a potter, Sam just can't bring himself to saying he loves her but only saying ditto. One night, as Sam proposes to Molly, some thug named Willie(the late Rick Aviles), kills Sam as Sam while trying to chase him realizes he is a ghost nobody can hear or see. As Molly is beside grief. Sam later learns that he was not killed by a random accident. And with reluctant help from a con artist-medium Oda Mae(Oscar winner comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg), supplying huge comic relief, they try to help Molly who is also in danger. Sam is upset to realize it is his best friend and fellow worker Carl(Tony Goldwyn) who had him killed in an embezzling scheme. Now Sam must protect Molly along with go to the other side aka heaven as he failed to do so once he was killed in the first place. Plus with the help of a veteran ghost(played b the late Vincent Schiavelli), he helps to move objects with willpower. Really a loving and moving movie. Just love the romance and the chemistry between all three lead actors and supporting actors. RIP Patrick Swayze! Still great after 20+ years!

    There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman. "Ghost" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves. Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!

    Possibly the Best Supernatural Love Story Ever Filmed

    What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. "Ghost" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror. Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it. Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us "passes on". "Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

    Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again. I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since. Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory. The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clich&eacute;d characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out. This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films. Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.

    Given that the acting isn't that fantastic of the leading roles (although both were nominated for the Golden Globe), the storyline and clever script is really what makes this picture so gripping and an instant classic  as well the supportive performance of worldwide film favourite Whoopi Goldberg. Although this picture depicts the kind of supernatural romance that you only find in the most strangest of motion pictures, it's a kind of love that we can all relate to. The presence of Swayze's character  Sam  as a ghost is instantly forgotten as we as the audience simply focus on the love between him and Molly Jensen portrayed by Demi Moore in what would be her career-defining role. The movie opens up with the madly-in-love couple Sam and Molly whose love is simply an unbreakable bond as try to make a serious life for themselves in New York. Their world is, however, torn apart at the hands of a petty mugger who takes Sam's life to fulfil his own selfish needs and whose associates threaten the safety of his dearest love Molly. In an attempt to steer Molly away from such danger Sam (now as a ghost) is able to communicate through an apparent 'phony' psychic  Oda Mae played by Ms. Goldberg in her Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA Award-winning role  whose help is required to save Molly from the depths of despair surrounding her lover's killers. Something I don't particularly enjoy and take interest of in a picture is its musical scoring. Composed by Maurice Jarre, the score's so stunningly crafted and performed incredibly well to suit to movie; beginning softly and reflectively before opening up into an outburst of love and triumph as the orchestral piece is in full swing. Nominated for Best Score at the 1991 Oscars, I never thought I would say this about a musical category but Jarre should have won that golden statuette!

    Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts. Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.

    The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her. However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy. Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem. Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites. I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.

    Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death. The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.

    No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting. Indeed, the main premise of "Ghost", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But "Ghost"'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen. And there's another clich&eacute; that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.

I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves. Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!

    What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. "Ghost" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror. Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it. Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us "passes on". "Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

    Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again. I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since. Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory. The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clich&eacute;d characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out. This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films. Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.

    Given that the acting isn't that fantastic of the leading roles (although both were nominated for the Golden Globe), the storyline and clever script is really what makes this picture so gripping and an instant classic  as well the supportive performance of worldwide film favourite Whoopi Goldberg. Although this picture depicts the kind of supernatural romance that you only find in the most strangest of motion pictures, it's a kind of love that we can all relate to. The presence of Swayze's character  Sam  as a ghost is instantly forgotten as we as the audience simply focus on the love between him and Molly Jensen portrayed by Demi Moore in what would be her career-defining role. The movie opens up with the madly-in-love couple Sam and Molly whose love is simply an unbreakable bond as try to make a serious life for themselves in New York. Their world is, however, torn apart at the hands of a petty mugger who takes Sam's life to fulfil his own selfish needs and whose associates threaten the safety of his dearest love Molly. In an attempt to steer Molly away from such danger Sam (now as a ghost) is able to communicate through an apparent 'phony' psychic  Oda Mae played by Ms. Goldberg in her Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA Award-winning role  whose help is required to save Molly from the depths of despair surrounding her lover's killers. Something I don't particularly enjoy and take interest of in a picture is its musical scoring. Composed by Maurice Jarre, the score's so stunningly crafted and performed incredibly well to suit to movie; beginning softly and reflectively before opening up into an outburst of love and triumph as the orchestral piece is in full swing. Nominated for Best Score at the 1991 Oscars, I never thought I would say this about a musical category but Jarre should have won that golden statuette!

    Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts. Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.

    The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her. However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy. Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem. Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites. I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.

    Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death. The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.

    No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting. Indeed, the main premise of "Ghost", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But "Ghost"'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen. And there's another clich&eacute; that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.

    Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming. However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

    Really a loving and a moving story. About live in lovers, Sam(Played by the late Patrick Swayze), and Molly(Demi Moore) as they are living in a new apartment. But despite great jobs, he as a banker and she as a potter, Sam just can't bring himself to saying he loves her but only saying ditto. One night, as Sam proposes to Molly, some thug named Willie(the late Rick Aviles), kills Sam as Sam while trying to chase him realizes he is a ghost nobody can hear or see. As Molly is beside grief. Sam later learns that he was not killed by a random accident. And with reluctant help from a con artist-medium Oda Mae(Oscar winner comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg), supplying huge comic relief, they try to help Molly who is also in danger. Sam is upset to realize it is his best friend and fellow worker Carl(Tony Goldwyn) who had him killed in an embezzling scheme. Now Sam must protect Molly along with go to the other side aka heaven as he failed to do so once he was killed in the first place. Plus with the help of a veteran ghost(played b the late Vincent Schiavelli), he helps to move objects with willpower. Really a loving and moving movie. Just love the romance and the chemistry between all three lead actors and supporting actors. RIP Patrick Swayze! Still great after 20+ years!

    There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman. "Ghost" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves.

    Given that the acting isn't that fantastic of the leading roles (although both were nominated for the Golden Globe), the storyline and clever script is really what makes this picture so gripping and an instant classic  as well the supportive performance of worldwide film favourite Whoopi Goldberg. Although this picture depicts the kind of supernatural romance that you only find in the most strangest of motion pictures, it's a kind of love that we can all relate to. The presence of Swayze's character  Sam  as a ghost is instantly forgotten as we as the audience simply focus on the love between him and Molly Jensen portrayed by Demi Moore in what would be her career-defining role. The movie opens up with the madly-in-love couple Sam and Molly whose love is simply an unbreakable bond as try to make a serious life for themselves in New York. Their world is, however, torn apart at the hands of a petty mugger who takes Sam's life to fulfil his own selfish needs and whose associates threaten the safety of his dearest love Molly. In an attempt to steer Molly away from such danger Sam (now as a ghost) is able to communicate through an apparent 'phony' psychic  Oda Mae played by Ms. Goldberg in her Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA Award-winning role  whose help is required to save Molly from the depths of despair surrounding her lover's killers. Something I don't particularly enjoy and take interest of in a picture is its musical scoring. Composed by Maurice Jarre, the score's so stunningly crafted and performed incredibly well to suit to movie; beginning softly and reflectively before opening up into an outburst of love and triumph as the orchestral piece is in full swing. Nominated for Best Score at the 1991 Oscars, I never thought I would say this about a musical category but Jarre should have won that golden statuette!

    Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts. Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.

    The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her. However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy. Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem. Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites. I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.

    Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death. The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.

    No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting. Indeed, the main premise of "Ghost", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But "Ghost"'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen. And there's another clich&eacute; that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.

    Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming. However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

    Really a loving and a moving story. About live in lovers, Sam(Played by the late Patrick Swayze), and Molly(Demi Moore) as they are living in a new apartment. But despite great jobs, he as a banker and she as a potter, Sam just can't bring himself to saying he loves her but only saying ditto. One night, as Sam proposes to Molly, some thug named Willie(the late Rick Aviles), kills Sam as Sam while trying to chase him realizes he is a ghost nobody can hear or see. As Molly is beside grief. Sam later learns that he was not killed by a random accident. And with reluctant help from a con artist-medium Oda Mae(Oscar winner comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg), supplying huge comic relief, they try to help Molly who is also in danger. Sam is upset to realize it is his best friend and fellow worker Carl(Tony Goldwyn) who had him killed in an embezzling scheme. Now Sam must protect Molly along with go to the other side aka heaven as he failed to do so once he was killed in the first place. Plus with the help of a veteran ghost(played b the late Vincent Schiavelli), he helps to move objects with willpower. Really a loving and moving movie. Just love the romance and the chemistry between all three lead actors and supporting actors. RIP Patrick Swayze! Still great after 20+ years!

    There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman. "Ghost" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves. Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!

    Possibly the Best Supernatural Love Story Ever Filmed

    What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. "Ghost" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror. Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it. Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us "passes on". "Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

    Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again. I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since. Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory. The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clich&eacute;d characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out. This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films. Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.

The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But "Ghost"'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen. And there's another clich&eacute; that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.

    Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming. However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

    Really a loving and a moving story. About live in lovers, Sam(Played by the late Patrick Swayze), and Molly(Demi Moore) as they are living in a new apartment. But despite great jobs, he as a banker and she as a potter, Sam just can't bring himself to saying he loves her but only saying ditto. One night, as Sam proposes to Molly, some thug named Willie(the late Rick Aviles), kills Sam as Sam while trying to chase him realizes he is a ghost nobody can hear or see. As Molly is beside grief. Sam later learns that he was not killed by a random accident. And with reluctant help from a con artist-medium Oda Mae(Oscar winner comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg), supplying huge comic relief, they try to help Molly who is also in danger. Sam is upset to realize it is his best friend and fellow worker Carl(Tony Goldwyn) who had him killed in an embezzling scheme. Now Sam must protect Molly along with go to the other side aka heaven as he failed to do so once he was killed in the first place. Plus with the help of a veteran ghost(played b the late Vincent Schiavelli), he helps to move objects with willpower. Really a loving and moving movie. Just love the romance and the chemistry between all three lead actors and supporting actors. RIP Patrick Swayze! Still great after 20+ years!

    There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman. "Ghost" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves. Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!

    Possibly the Best Supernatural Love Story Ever Filmed

    What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. "Ghost" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror. Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it. Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us "passes on". "Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

    Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again. I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since. Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory. The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clich&eacute;d characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out. This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films. Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.

    Given that the acting isn't that fantastic of the leading roles (although both were nominated for the Golden Globe), the storyline and clever script is really what makes this picture so gripping and an instant classic  as well the supportive performance of worldwide film favourite Whoopi Goldberg. Although this picture depicts the kind of supernatural romance that you only find in the most strangest of motion pictures, it's a kind of love that we can all relate to. The presence of Swayze's character  Sam  as a ghost is instantly forgotten as we as the audience simply focus on the love between him and Molly Jensen portrayed by Demi Moore in what would be her career-defining role. The movie opens up with the madly-in-love couple Sam and Molly whose love is simply an unbreakable bond as try to make a serious life for themselves in New York. Their world is, however, torn apart at the hands of a petty mugger who takes Sam's life to fulfil his own selfish needs and whose associates threaten the safety of his dearest love Molly. In an attempt to steer Molly away from such danger Sam (now as a ghost) is able to communicate through an apparent 'phony' psychic  Oda Mae played by Ms. Goldberg in her Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA Award-winning role  whose help is required to save Molly from the depths of despair surrounding her lover's killers. Something I don't particularly enjoy and take interest of in a picture is its musical scoring. Composed by Maurice Jarre, the score's so stunningly crafted and performed incredibly well to suit to movie; beginning softly and reflectively before opening up into an outburst of love and triumph as the orchestral piece is in full swing. Nominated for Best Score at the 1991 Oscars, I never thought I would say this about a musical category but Jarre should have won that golden statuette!

    Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts. Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.

    The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her. However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy. Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem. Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites. I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.

    Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death. The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.

    No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting. Indeed, the main premise of "Ghost", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know.

This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything.

The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

    Really a loving and a moving story. About live in lovers, Sam(Played by the late Patrick Swayze), and Molly(Demi Moore) as they are living in a new apartment. But despite great jobs, he as a banker and she as a potter, Sam just can't bring himself to saying he loves her but only saying ditto. One night, as Sam proposes to Molly, some thug named Willie(the late Rick Aviles), kills Sam as Sam while trying to chase him realizes he is a ghost nobody can hear or see. As Molly is beside grief. Sam later learns that he was not killed by a random accident. And with reluctant help from a con artist-medium Oda Mae(Oscar winner comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg), supplying huge comic relief, they try to help Molly who is also in danger. Sam is upset to realize it is his best friend and fellow worker Carl(Tony Goldwyn) who had him killed in an embezzling scheme. Now Sam must protect Molly along with go to the other side aka heaven as he failed to do so once he was killed in the first place. Plus with the help of a veteran ghost(played b the late Vincent Schiavelli), he helps to move objects with willpower. Really a loving and moving movie. Just love the romance and the chemistry between all three lead actors and supporting actors. RIP Patrick Swayze! Still great after 20+ years!

    There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman. "Ghost" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves. Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!

    What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. "Ghost" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror. Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it. Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us "passes on". "Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

    Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again. I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since. Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory. The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clich&eacute;d characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out. This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films. Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.

    Given that the acting isn't that fantastic of the leading roles (although both were nominated for the Golden Globe), the storyline and clever script is really what makes this picture so gripping and an instant classic  as well the supportive performance of worldwide film favourite Whoopi Goldberg. Although this picture depicts the kind of supernatural romance that you only find in the most strangest of motion pictures, it's a kind of love that we can all relate to. The presence of Swayze's character  Sam  as a ghost is instantly forgotten as we as the audience simply focus on the love between him and Molly Jensen portrayed by Demi Moore in what would be her career-defining role. The movie opens up with the madly-in-love couple Sam and Molly whose love is simply an unbreakable bond as try to make a serious life for themselves in New York. Their world is, however, torn apart at the hands of a petty mugger who takes Sam's life to fulfil his own selfish needs and whose associates threaten the safety of his dearest love Molly. In an attempt to steer Molly away from such danger Sam (now as a ghost) is able to communicate through an apparent 'phony' psychic  Oda Mae played by Ms. Goldberg in her Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA Award-winning role  whose help is required to save Molly from the depths of despair surrounding her lover's killers. Something I don't particularly enjoy and take interest of in a picture is its musical scoring. Composed by Maurice Jarre, the score's so stunningly crafted and performed incredibly well to suit to movie; beginning softly and reflectively before opening up into an outburst of love and triumph as the orchestral piece is in full swing. Nominated for Best Score at the 1991 Oscars, I never thought I would say this about a musical category but Jarre should have won that golden statuette!

    Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts. Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.

    The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her. However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy. Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem. Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites. I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.

    Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death. The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.

    No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting. Indeed, the main premise of "Ghost", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But "Ghost"'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen. And there's another clich&eacute; that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.

    Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming. However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

"Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

    Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again. I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since. Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory. The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clich&eacute;d characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out. This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films. Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.

    Given that the acting isn't that fantastic of the leading roles (although both were nominated for the Golden Globe), the storyline and clever script is really what makes this picture so gripping and an instant classic  as well the supportive performance of worldwide film favourite Whoopi Goldberg. Although this picture depicts the kind of supernatural romance that you only find in the most strangest of motion pictures, it's a kind of love that we can all relate to. The presence of Swayze's character  Sam  as a ghost is instantly forgotten as we as the audience simply focus on the love between him and Molly Jensen portrayed by Demi Moore in what would be her career-defining role. The movie opens up with the madly-in-love couple Sam and Molly whose love is simply an unbreakable bond as try to make a serious life for themselves in New York. Their world is, however, torn apart at the hands of a petty mugger who takes Sam's life to fulfil his own selfish needs and whose associates threaten the safety of his dearest love Molly. In an attempt to steer Molly away from such danger Sam (now as a ghost) is able to communicate through an apparent 'phony' psychic  Oda Mae played by Ms. Goldberg in her Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA Award-winning role  whose help is required to save Molly from the depths of despair surrounding her lover's killers. Something I don't particularly enjoy and take interest of in a picture is its musical scoring. Composed by Maurice Jarre, the score's so stunningly crafted and performed incredibly well to suit to movie; beginning softly and reflectively before opening up into an outburst of love and triumph as the orchestral piece is in full swing. Nominated for Best Score at the 1991 Oscars, I never thought I would say this about a musical category but Jarre should have won that golden statuette!

    Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts. Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.

    The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her. However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy. Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem. Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites. I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.

    Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death. The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.

    No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting. Indeed, the main premise of "Ghost", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But "Ghost"'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen. And there's another clich&eacute; that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.

    Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming. However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

    Really a loving and a moving story. About live in lovers, Sam(Played by the late Patrick Swayze), and Molly(Demi Moore) as they are living in a new apartment. But despite great jobs, he as a banker and she as a potter, Sam just can't bring himself to saying he loves her but only saying ditto. One night, as Sam proposes to Molly, some thug named Willie(the late Rick Aviles), kills Sam as Sam while trying to chase him realizes he is a ghost nobody can hear or see. As Molly is beside grief. Sam later learns that he was not killed by a random accident. And with reluctant help from a con artist-medium Oda Mae(Oscar winner comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg), supplying huge comic relief, they try to help Molly who is also in danger. Sam is upset to realize it is his best friend and fellow worker Carl(Tony Goldwyn) who had him killed in an embezzling scheme. Now Sam must protect Molly along with go to the other side aka heaven as he failed to do so once he was killed in the first place. Plus with the help of a veteran ghost(played b the late Vincent Schiavelli), he helps to move objects with willpower. Really a loving and moving movie. Just love the romance and the chemistry between all three lead actors and supporting actors. RIP Patrick Swayze! Still great after 20+ years!

    There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman. "Ghost" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves. Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!

    What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. "Ghost" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror. Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it. Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us "passes on". "Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

(Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem. Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites. I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.

    Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death. The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.

    No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting. Indeed, the main premise of "Ghost", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But "Ghost"'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen. And there's another clich&eacute; that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.

    Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming. However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

    Really a loving and a moving story. About live in lovers, Sam(Played by the late Patrick Swayze), and Molly(Demi Moore) as they are living in a new apartment. But despite great jobs, he as a banker and she as a potter, Sam just can't bring himself to saying he loves her but only saying ditto. One night, as Sam proposes to Molly, some thug named Willie(the late Rick Aviles), kills Sam as Sam while trying to chase him realizes he is a ghost nobody can hear or see. As Molly is beside grief. Sam later learns that he was not killed by a random accident. And with reluctant help from a con artist-medium Oda Mae(Oscar winner comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg), supplying huge comic relief, they try to help Molly who is also in danger. Sam is upset to realize it is his best friend and fellow worker Carl(Tony Goldwyn) who had him killed in an embezzling scheme. Now Sam must protect Molly along with go to the other side aka heaven as he failed to do so once he was killed in the first place. Plus with the help of a veteran ghost(played b the late Vincent Schiavelli), he helps to move objects with willpower. Really a loving and moving movie. Just love the romance and the chemistry between all three lead actors and supporting actors. RIP Patrick Swayze! Still great after 20+ years!

    There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman. "Ghost" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves. Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!

    Possibly the Best Supernatural Love Story Ever Filmed

    What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. "Ghost" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror. Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it. Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us "passes on". "Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

    Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again. I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since. Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory. The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clich&eacute;d characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out. This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films. Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.

    Given that the acting isn't that fantastic of the leading roles (although both were nominated for the Golden Globe), the storyline and clever script is really what makes this picture so gripping and an instant classic  as well the supportive performance of worldwide film favourite Whoopi Goldberg. Although this picture depicts the kind of supernatural romance that you only find in the most strangest of motion pictures, it's a kind of love that we can all relate to. The presence of Swayze's character  Sam  as a ghost is instantly forgotten as we as the audience simply focus on the love between him and Molly Jensen portrayed by Demi Moore in what would be her career-defining role. The movie opens up with the madly-in-love couple Sam and Molly whose love is simply an unbreakable bond as try to make a serious life for themselves in New York. Their world is, however, torn apart at the hands of a petty mugger who takes Sam's life to fulfil his own selfish needs and whose associates threaten the safety of his dearest love Molly. In an attempt to steer Molly away from such danger Sam (now as a ghost) is able to communicate through an apparent 'phony' psychic  Oda Mae played by Ms. Goldberg in her Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA Award-winning role  whose help is required to save Molly from the depths of despair surrounding her lover's killers. Something I don't particularly enjoy and take interest of in a picture is its musical scoring. Composed by Maurice Jarre, the score's so stunningly crafted and performed incredibly well to suit to movie; beginning softly and reflectively before opening up into an outburst of love and triumph as the orchestral piece is in full swing. Nominated for Best Score at the 1991 Oscars, I never thought I would say this about a musical category but Jarre should have won that golden statuette!

    Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts. Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.

    The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her. However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy. Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem.

And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.

    Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming. However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead. 7/10

    Really a loving and a moving story. About live in lovers, Sam(Played by the late Patrick Swayze), and Molly(Demi Moore) as they are living in a new apartment. But despite great jobs, he as a banker and she as a potter, Sam just can't bring himself to saying he loves her but only saying ditto. One night, as Sam proposes to Molly, some thug named Willie(the late Rick Aviles), kills Sam as Sam while trying to chase him realizes he is a ghost nobody can hear or see. As Molly is beside grief. Sam later learns that he was not killed by a random accident. And with reluctant help from a con artist-medium Oda Mae(Oscar winner comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg), supplying huge comic relief, they try to help Molly who is also in danger. Sam is upset to realize it is his best friend and fellow worker Carl(Tony Goldwyn) who had him killed in an embezzling scheme. Now Sam must protect Molly along with go to the other side aka heaven as he failed to do so once he was killed in the first place. Plus with the help of a veteran ghost(played b the late Vincent Schiavelli), he helps to move objects with willpower. Really a loving and moving movie. Just love the romance and the chemistry between all three lead actors and supporting actors. RIP Patrick Swayze! Still great after 20+ years!

    There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman. "Ghost" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine. Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another "Magical Negro" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves. Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!

    Possibly the Best Supernatural Love Story Ever Filmed

    What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. "Ghost" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror. Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it. Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us "passes on". "Ghost" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.

    Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again. I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since. Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory. The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's "on the surface" clich&eacute;d characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the "Subway Ghost," acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out. This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films. Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.

    Given that the acting isn't that fantastic of the leading roles (although both were nominated for the Golden Globe), the storyline and clever script is really what makes this picture so gripping and an instant classic  as well the supportive performance of worldwide film favourite Whoopi Goldberg. Although this picture depicts the kind of supernatural romance that you only find in the most strangest of motion pictures, it's a kind of love that we can all relate to. The presence of Swayze's character  Sam  as a ghost is instantly forgotten as we as the audience simply focus on the love between him and Molly Jensen portrayed by Demi Moore in what would be her career-defining role. The movie opens up with the madly-in-love couple Sam and Molly whose love is simply an unbreakable bond as try to make a serious life for themselves in New York. Their world is, however, torn apart at the hands of a petty mugger who takes Sam's life to fulfil his own selfish needs and whose associates threaten the safety of his dearest love Molly. In an attempt to steer Molly away from such danger Sam (now as a ghost) is able to communicate through an apparent 'phony' psychic  Oda Mae played by Ms. Goldberg in her Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA Award-winning role  whose help is required to save Molly from the depths of despair surrounding her lover's killers. Something I don't particularly enjoy and take interest of in a picture is its musical scoring. Composed by Maurice Jarre, the score's so stunningly crafted and performed incredibly well to suit to movie; beginning softly and reflectively before opening up into an outburst of love and triumph as the orchestral piece is in full swing. Nominated for Best Score at the 1991 Oscars, I never thought I would say this about a musical category but Jarre should have won that golden statuette!

    Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts. Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.

    The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her. However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy. Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem. Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites. I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.

    Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death. The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.

    No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting. Indeed, the main premise of "Ghost", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either "Elvis of Aristotles"? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon. And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clich&eacute;s, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But "Ghost"'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen. And there's another clich&eacute; that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like "Ghost" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with "Unchained Melody" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality. Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.
