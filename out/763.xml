    In the movie "Happy Gilmore" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment. In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in "Happy Gilmore" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.

    Many have consider this one of the funniest movie of all-time. Seriously? I did not laugh once during this film. All the intended funny scene involved someone getting hit with an item (golf balls, ac unit, nail-gun, golf club) Happy beating up someone/something, characters cursing/threatening someone, and Adam Sandler's character pretending objects were his penis. This is not a movie for those that enjoy high-brow comedy. If you enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos, this a movie for you. Otherwise, skip this low-brow, slapstick-filled, lame attempt at humor. AT least this movie didn't resort to the lowest form of humor: fart jokes.

    Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was "Billy Madison" and this one here "Happy Gilmore".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. "Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule. Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe. With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand. Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature. There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after "Billy Madison" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.

    If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be "Happy Gilmore." This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since. Unlike some of the so-called "smart comedies" of the past few years, "Happy Gilmore," doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from "Rocky"), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy). Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan. Recently coming off "Saturday Night Live" and releasing his classic comedy album "What the Hell Happened to Me?" only days earlier, "Happy Gilmore" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top.

    When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't "hit a golf ball 400 feet." That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far. The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, "Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!" Then Chubs says, "By god son, you're making me sick!" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour. Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, "Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, "Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, "That's too thus far Shooter!" Shooter answers back, "Oh you count?" Then Mr. Larson fires back, "And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!" The crowd goes, "OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own "Happy place". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself. This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!

    Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a "Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good. Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore. What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go. Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular. Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast. What? You eat sh*t do you?

    Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler and is probably his most loved and memorable film. The film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who never seems to make the team. When the IRS come and give him a deadline of 90 days to make enough money to save his grandmother's house, he becomes a golf player in order to make the money. Well, it's slapstick at it's finest. And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.

    I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny. Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies. The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.

    You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things. The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like "you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 stars P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.

    To be honest, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. He did some films that received mixed to negative reviews including the atrocious Jack and Jill movie (which, thank god, I'll never see!), but I think he did some very decent films including Big Daddy and this one is an even better Adam Sandler film. The story's predictable and could've been so much better, but it had at least some good moments throughout the film and there can be some disbelief in the Dialogue. With that said, everything turned out great. It has some nice cinematography and some beautiful scenery. The cast is the strongest aspect of the film. Adam Sandler, although a bit annoying, was goofy and did a great job as the lead character and the hilarious moments with him were fantastic and unforgettable. The other actors including Christopher McDonald did great with their performances. The second strongest aspect goes to the music from Mark Mothersbaugh because it helped make some emotion and tense to the film. Overall, not a masterpiece, but a hilarious and underrated comedy and one of Adam Sandler's better films. Thumbs up! 8/10

After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from "Rocky"), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy). Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan. Recently coming off "Saturday Night Live" and releasing his classic comedy album "What the Hell Happened to Me?" only days earlier, "Happy Gilmore" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top.

    When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't "hit a golf ball 400 feet." That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far. The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, "Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!" Then Chubs says, "By god son, you're making me sick!" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour. Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, "Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, "Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, "That's too thus far Shooter!" Shooter answers back, "Oh you count?" Then Mr. Larson fires back, "And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!" The crowd goes, "OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own "Happy place". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself. This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!

    Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a "Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good. Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore. What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go. Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular. Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast. What? You eat sh*t do you?

    Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler and is probably his most loved and memorable film. The film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who never seems to make the team. When the IRS come and give him a deadline of 90 days to make enough money to save his grandmother's house, he becomes a golf player in order to make the money. Well, it's slapstick at it's finest. And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.

    I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny. Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies. The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.

    You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things. The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like "you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 stars P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.

    To be honest, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. He did some films that received mixed to negative reviews including the atrocious Jack and Jill movie (which, thank god, I'll never see!), but I think he did some very decent films including Big Daddy and this one is an even better Adam Sandler film. The story's predictable and could've been so much better, but it had at least some good moments throughout the film and there can be some disbelief in the Dialogue. With that said, everything turned out great. It has some nice cinematography and some beautiful scenery. The cast is the strongest aspect of the film. Adam Sandler, although a bit annoying, was goofy and did a great job as the lead character and the hilarious moments with him were fantastic and unforgettable. The other actors including Christopher McDonald did great with their performances. The second strongest aspect goes to the music from Mark Mothersbaugh because it helped make some emotion and tense to the film. Overall, not a masterpiece, but a hilarious and underrated comedy and one of Adam Sandler's better films. Thumbs up! 8/10

    In the movie "Happy Gilmore" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment. In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in "Happy Gilmore" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.

    Many have consider this one of the funniest movie of all-time. Seriously? I did not laugh once during this film. All the intended funny scene involved someone getting hit with an item (golf balls, ac unit, nail-gun, golf club) Happy beating up someone/something, characters cursing/threatening someone, and Adam Sandler's character pretending objects were his penis. This is not a movie for those that enjoy high-brow comedy. If you enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos, this a movie for you. Otherwise, skip this low-brow, slapstick-filled, lame attempt at humor. AT least this movie didn't resort to the lowest form of humor: fart jokes.

    Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was "Billy Madison" and this one here "Happy Gilmore".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. "Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule. Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe. With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand. Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature. There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after "Billy Madison" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.

    If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be "Happy Gilmore." This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since. Unlike some of the so-called "smart comedies" of the past few years, "Happy Gilmore," doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from "Rocky"), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy). Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan.

And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.

    I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny. Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies. The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.

    You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things. The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like "you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 stars P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.

    To be honest, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. He did some films that received mixed to negative reviews including the atrocious Jack and Jill movie (which, thank god, I'll never see!), but I think he did some very decent films including Big Daddy and this one is an even better Adam Sandler film. The story's predictable and could've been so much better, but it had at least some good moments throughout the film and there can be some disbelief in the Dialogue. With that said, everything turned out great. It has some nice cinematography and some beautiful scenery. The cast is the strongest aspect of the film. Adam Sandler, although a bit annoying, was goofy and did a great job as the lead character and the hilarious moments with him were fantastic and unforgettable. The other actors including Christopher McDonald did great with their performances. The second strongest aspect goes to the music from Mark Mothersbaugh because it helped make some emotion and tense to the film. Overall, not a masterpiece, but a hilarious and underrated comedy and one of Adam Sandler's better films. Thumbs up! 8/10

    In the movie "Happy Gilmore" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment. In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in "Happy Gilmore" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.

    Many have consider this one of the funniest movie of all-time. Seriously? I did not laugh once during this film. All the intended funny scene involved someone getting hit with an item (golf balls, ac unit, nail-gun, golf club) Happy beating up someone/something, characters cursing/threatening someone, and Adam Sandler's character pretending objects were his penis. This is not a movie for those that enjoy high-brow comedy. If you enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos, this a movie for you. Otherwise, skip this low-brow, slapstick-filled, lame attempt at humor. AT least this movie didn't resort to the lowest form of humor: fart jokes.

    Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was "Billy Madison" and this one here "Happy Gilmore".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. "Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule. Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe. With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand. Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature. There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after "Billy Madison" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.

    If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be "Happy Gilmore." This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since. Unlike some of the so-called "smart comedies" of the past few years, "Happy Gilmore," doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from "Rocky"), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy). Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan. Recently coming off "Saturday Night Live" and releasing his classic comedy album "What the Hell Happened to Me?" only days earlier, "Happy Gilmore" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top.

    When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't "hit a golf ball 400 feet." That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far. The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, "Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!" Then Chubs says, "By god son, you're making me sick!" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour. Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, "Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, "Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, "That's too thus far Shooter!" Shooter answers back, "Oh you count?" Then Mr. Larson fires back, "And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!" The crowd goes, "OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own "Happy place". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself. This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!

    Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a "Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good. Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore. What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go. Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular. Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast. What? You eat sh*t do you?

He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.

    Many have consider this one of the funniest movie of all-time. Seriously? I did not laugh once during this film. All the intended funny scene involved someone getting hit with an item (golf balls, ac unit, nail-gun, golf club) Happy beating up someone/something, characters cursing/threatening someone, and Adam Sandler's character pretending objects were his penis. This is not a movie for those that enjoy high-brow comedy. If you enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos, this a movie for you. Otherwise, skip this low-brow, slapstick-filled, lame attempt at humor. AT least this movie didn't resort to the lowest form of humor: fart jokes.

    Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was "Billy Madison" and this one here "Happy Gilmore".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. "Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule. Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe. With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand. Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature. There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after "Billy Madison" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.

    If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be "Happy Gilmore." This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since. Unlike some of the so-called "smart comedies" of the past few years, "Happy Gilmore," doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from "Rocky"), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy). Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan. Recently coming off "Saturday Night Live" and releasing his classic comedy album "What the Hell Happened to Me?" only days earlier, "Happy Gilmore" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top.

    When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't "hit a golf ball 400 feet." That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far. The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, "Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!" Then Chubs says, "By god son, you're making me sick!" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour. Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, "Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, "Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, "That's too thus far Shooter!" Shooter answers back, "Oh you count?" Then Mr. Larson fires back, "And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!" The crowd goes, "OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own "Happy place". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself. This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!

    Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a "Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good. Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore. What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go. Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular. Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast. What? You eat sh*t do you?

    Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler and is probably his most loved and memorable film. The film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who never seems to make the team. When the IRS come and give him a deadline of 90 days to make enough money to save his grandmother's house, he becomes a golf player in order to make the money. Well, it's slapstick at it's finest. And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.

    I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny. Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies. The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.

    You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things. The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like "you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 stars P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.

    To be honest, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. He did some films that received mixed to negative reviews including the atrocious Jack and Jill movie (which, thank god, I'll never see!), but I think he did some very decent films including Big Daddy and this one is an even better Adam Sandler film. The story's predictable and could've been so much better, but it had at least some good moments throughout the film and there can be some disbelief in the Dialogue. With that said, everything turned out great. It has some nice cinematography and some beautiful scenery. The cast is the strongest aspect of the film. Adam Sandler, although a bit annoying, was goofy and did a great job as the lead character and the hilarious moments with him were fantastic and unforgettable. The other actors including Christopher McDonald did great with their performances. The second strongest aspect goes to the music from Mark Mothersbaugh because it helped make some emotion and tense to the film. Overall, not a masterpiece, but a hilarious and underrated comedy and one of Adam Sandler's better films. Thumbs up! 8/10

    In the movie "Happy Gilmore" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment. In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in "Happy Gilmore" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.

A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, "Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, "Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, "That's too thus far Shooter!" Shooter answers back, "Oh you count?" Then Mr. Larson fires back, "And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!" The crowd goes, "OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own "Happy place". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself. This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!

    Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a "Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good. Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore. What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go. Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular. Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast. What? You eat sh*t do you?

    Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler and is probably his most loved and memorable film. The film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who never seems to make the team. When the IRS come and give him a deadline of 90 days to make enough money to save his grandmother's house, he becomes a golf player in order to make the money. Well, it's slapstick at it's finest. And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.

    I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny. Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies. The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.

    You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things. The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like "you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 stars P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.

    To be honest, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. He did some films that received mixed to negative reviews including the atrocious Jack and Jill movie (which, thank god, I'll never see!), but I think he did some very decent films including Big Daddy and this one is an even better Adam Sandler film. The story's predictable and could've been so much better, but it had at least some good moments throughout the film and there can be some disbelief in the Dialogue. With that said, everything turned out great. It has some nice cinematography and some beautiful scenery. The cast is the strongest aspect of the film. Adam Sandler, although a bit annoying, was goofy and did a great job as the lead character and the hilarious moments with him were fantastic and unforgettable. The other actors including Christopher McDonald did great with their performances. The second strongest aspect goes to the music from Mark Mothersbaugh because it helped make some emotion and tense to the film. Overall, not a masterpiece, but a hilarious and underrated comedy and one of Adam Sandler's better films. Thumbs up! 8/10

    In the movie "Happy Gilmore" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment. In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in "Happy Gilmore" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.

    Many have consider this one of the funniest movie of all-time. Seriously? I did not laugh once during this film. All the intended funny scene involved someone getting hit with an item (golf balls, ac unit, nail-gun, golf club) Happy beating up someone/something, characters cursing/threatening someone, and Adam Sandler's character pretending objects were his penis. This is not a movie for those that enjoy high-brow comedy. If you enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos, this a movie for you. Otherwise, skip this low-brow, slapstick-filled, lame attempt at humor. AT least this movie didn't resort to the lowest form of humor: fart jokes.

    Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was "Billy Madison" and this one here "Happy Gilmore".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. "Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule. Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe. With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand. Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature. There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after "Billy Madison" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.

    If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be "Happy Gilmore." This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since. Unlike some of the so-called "smart comedies" of the past few years, "Happy Gilmore," doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from "Rocky"), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy). Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan. Recently coming off "Saturday Night Live" and releasing his classic comedy album "What the Hell Happened to Me?" only days earlier, "Happy Gilmore" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top.

    When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't "hit a golf ball 400 feet." That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far. The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, "Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!" Then Chubs says, "By god son, you're making me sick!" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour. Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, "Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, "Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, "That's too thus far Shooter!" Shooter answers back, "Oh you count?" Then Mr. Larson fires back, "And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!" The crowd goes, "OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own "Happy place". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself. This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!

However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things. The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like "you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 stars P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.

    To be honest, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. He did some films that received mixed to negative reviews including the atrocious Jack and Jill movie (which, thank god, I'll never see!), but I think he did some very decent films including Big Daddy and this one is an even better Adam Sandler film. The story's predictable and could've been so much better, but it had at least some good moments throughout the film and there can be some disbelief in the Dialogue. With that said, everything turned out great. It has some nice cinematography and some beautiful scenery. The cast is the strongest aspect of the film. Adam Sandler, although a bit annoying, was goofy and did a great job as the lead character and the hilarious moments with him were fantastic and unforgettable. The other actors including Christopher McDonald did great with their performances. The second strongest aspect goes to the music from Mark Mothersbaugh because it helped make some emotion and tense to the film. Overall, not a masterpiece, but a hilarious and underrated comedy and one of Adam Sandler's better films. Thumbs up! 8/10

    In the movie "Happy Gilmore" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment. In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in "Happy Gilmore" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.

    Many have consider this one of the funniest movie of all-time. Seriously? I did not laugh once during this film. All the intended funny scene involved someone getting hit with an item (golf balls, ac unit, nail-gun, golf club) Happy beating up someone/something, characters cursing/threatening someone, and Adam Sandler's character pretending objects were his penis. This is not a movie for those that enjoy high-brow comedy. If you enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos, this a movie for you. Otherwise, skip this low-brow, slapstick-filled, lame attempt at humor. AT least this movie didn't resort to the lowest form of humor: fart jokes.

    Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was "Billy Madison" and this one here "Happy Gilmore".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. "Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule. Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe. With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand. Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature. There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after "Billy Madison" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.

    If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be "Happy Gilmore." This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since. Unlike some of the so-called "smart comedies" of the past few years, "Happy Gilmore," doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from "Rocky"), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy). Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan. Recently coming off "Saturday Night Live" and releasing his classic comedy album "What the Hell Happened to Me?" only days earlier, "Happy Gilmore" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top.

    When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't "hit a golf ball 400 feet." That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far. The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, "Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!" Then Chubs says, "By god son, you're making me sick!" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour. Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, "Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, "Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, "That's too thus far Shooter!" Shooter answers back, "Oh you count?" Then Mr. Larson fires back, "And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!" The crowd goes, "OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own "Happy place". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself. This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!

    Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a "Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good. Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore. What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go. Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular. Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast. What? You eat sh*t do you?

    Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler and is probably his most loved and memorable film. The film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who never seems to make the team. When the IRS come and give him a deadline of 90 days to make enough money to save his grandmother's house, he becomes a golf player in order to make the money. Well, it's slapstick at it's finest. And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.

    I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny. Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies. The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.

    You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story.

There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after "Billy Madison" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.

    If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be "Happy Gilmore." This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since. Unlike some of the so-called "smart comedies" of the past few years, "Happy Gilmore," doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from "Rocky"), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy). Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan. Recently coming off "Saturday Night Live" and releasing his classic comedy album "What the Hell Happened to Me?" only days earlier, "Happy Gilmore" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top.

    When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't "hit a golf ball 400 feet." That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far. The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, "Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!" Then Chubs says, "By god son, you're making me sick!" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour. Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, "Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, "Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, "That's too thus far Shooter!" Shooter answers back, "Oh you count?" Then Mr. Larson fires back, "And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!" The crowd goes, "OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own "Happy place". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself. This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!

    Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a "Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good. Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore. What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go. Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular. Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast. What? You eat sh*t do you?

    Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler and is probably his most loved and memorable film. The film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who never seems to make the team. When the IRS come and give him a deadline of 90 days to make enough money to save his grandmother's house, he becomes a golf player in order to make the money. Well, it's slapstick at it's finest. And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.

    I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny. Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies. The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.

    You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things. The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like "you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 stars P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.

    To be honest, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. He did some films that received mixed to negative reviews including the atrocious Jack and Jill movie (which, thank god, I'll never see!), but I think he did some very decent films including Big Daddy and this one is an even better Adam Sandler film. The story's predictable and could've been so much better, but it had at least some good moments throughout the film and there can be some disbelief in the Dialogue. With that said, everything turned out great. It has some nice cinematography and some beautiful scenery. The cast is the strongest aspect of the film. Adam Sandler, although a bit annoying, was goofy and did a great job as the lead character and the hilarious moments with him were fantastic and unforgettable. The other actors including Christopher McDonald did great with their performances. The second strongest aspect goes to the music from Mark Mothersbaugh because it helped make some emotion and tense to the film. Overall, not a masterpiece, but a hilarious and underrated comedy and one of Adam Sandler's better films. Thumbs up! 8/10

    In the movie "Happy Gilmore" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment. In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in "Happy Gilmore" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.

    Many have consider this one of the funniest movie of all-time. Seriously? I did not laugh once during this film. All the intended funny scene involved someone getting hit with an item (golf balls, ac unit, nail-gun, golf club) Happy beating up someone/something, characters cursing/threatening someone, and Adam Sandler's character pretending objects were his penis. This is not a movie for those that enjoy high-brow comedy. If you enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos, this a movie for you. Otherwise, skip this low-brow, slapstick-filled, lame attempt at humor. AT least this movie didn't resort to the lowest form of humor: fart jokes.

    Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was "Billy Madison" and this one here "Happy Gilmore".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. "Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule. Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe. With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand. Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature. There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after "Billy Madison" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.

The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go. Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular. Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast. What? You eat sh*t do you?

    Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler and is probably his most loved and memorable film. The film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who never seems to make the team. When the IRS come and give him a deadline of 90 days to make enough money to save his grandmother's house, he becomes a golf player in order to make the money. Well, it's slapstick at it's finest. And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.

    I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny. Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies. The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.

    Consistently funny, but carried by an over-the-top Adam Sandler

    You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things. The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like "you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 stars P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.

    To be honest, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. He did some films that received mixed to negative reviews including the atrocious Jack and Jill movie (which, thank god, I'll never see!), but I think he did some very decent films including Big Daddy and this one is an even better Adam Sandler film. The story's predictable and could've been so much better, but it had at least some good moments throughout the film and there can be some disbelief in the Dialogue. With that said, everything turned out great. It has some nice cinematography and some beautiful scenery. The cast is the strongest aspect of the film. Adam Sandler, although a bit annoying, was goofy and did a great job as the lead character and the hilarious moments with him were fantastic and unforgettable. The other actors including Christopher McDonald did great with their performances. The second strongest aspect goes to the music from Mark Mothersbaugh because it helped make some emotion and tense to the film. Overall, not a masterpiece, but a hilarious and underrated comedy and one of Adam Sandler's better films. Thumbs up! 8/10
