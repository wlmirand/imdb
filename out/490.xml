    In 1955, Cary Grant came out of retirement to shot To Catch a Thief. The Cat's storyline, which is completely unrefined, suspenseless and tensionless, is in fact just an excuse for what apparently is the true nature of this movie, an uninteresting romance between Grant and Kelly where dialogs are pompous and endless. The script unconvincingly navigates between these two lines, and the disinterest is such that the final outcome, the revelation of the Cat's identity, doesn't trigger anu reaction. Moreover, the movie is filmed in an uninspired way by Hitchcock who relied on a bit too conveniently on the beauty of the Cote d'Azur and its hinterland. A few accelerated shots and a cheap nuit am&eacute;ricaine even arouse a real amazement. There is therefore not much to save from this movie, probably one of Hitchcock's worst, largely overrated by the critics as it is the case with most of the English's productions.

    In some of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films he uses fantastic scenery and backdrops to create a superb visual setting for his films such as the San Francisco backdrop in Vertigo which produced some of the most iconic images in film history with the famous Golden Gate Bridge. "To Catch a Thief" is one of Hitchcock's most superb visual efforts with the film taking place along the French Riviera which allows for some glamorous scenes filled with life and colour, with the film winning an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography". The film picked up an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography" The plot is centred on a famous retired jewel thief the 'Cat' who after a series of robberies is wrongly accused and chased by the police. Cary Grant is brilliant as John Robie (the Cat) who - like in Hitchcock's more famous "North by Northwest" Â– finds himself on the run despite being an innocent man. Grant is brilliant in his role as the calm and cool Robie who attempts to track down the real thief and prove his innocence. Grace Kelly stars as Frances Stevens, a young woman who Robie gets close to as he believes her mother may be the thief's next target and her performance is superb. Some of the most enjoyable scenes in the film come in the middle where we see the two interact with each other; the chemistry is superb with both smart and humorous dialogue between the pair. Hitchcock is known as the 'master of suspense' having created some of the most superb psychological thrillers there is. Although this film may be a thriller it is far from what you may expect from Hitchcock who instead focuses on creating a lighter, more pleasant and beautiful story filled with an enjoyable romance. That's not to say that the film does not have any elements of a usual Hitchcock thriller, after all the film is centred around uncovering the mystery that it the new 'Cat thief' and it's the mystery that makes for some great final scenes along the rooftops of Cannes. I highly recommend "To Catch a Thief", a film that are you are very much likely to enjoy. It's certainly not a Hitchcock classic that is spoke about in the same ilk as the likes of "Vertigo", "Psycho" and others but for what it is, it is a highly likable film that combines great acting, beautiful scenery and a highly enjoyable plot.

    I've just started watching this film on its new DVD format and it's a sight to behold indeed but the plot is the dumbest thing to come down the pike in years! To begin with, we are to believe that Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief, was in prison serving his term when the prison was bombed and he escaped only to join the resistance and become a hero in the process therefore absolving himself of all past crimes. Give me a break! And we are to believe this tripe? I'll watch the rest of it because I am a big Grace Kelly fan and she made so few films but whereas she looks absolutely breathtaking, Grant is way too tanned and almost looks African-American in some scenes. Why they didn't tone him down is something I will never understand. I'm giving it a 5 only because of Grace Kelly but between the absurd plot and Grant's absurd looks a 5 is the best I can do.

    This marked the first time I have seen a Cary Grant film. This is a remarkable confession for a movie guy like myself. The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch. Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a "low-class" thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past. As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Seeing this described as light-weight Hitchcock was simply wrong. It has a light atmosphere and there are better Hitchcocks, but it is well-paced and is among the the most entertaining Hitchcock movies yet. First off: the landscapes of South-France! When the Tour de France is broadcast, it is as much a display of the cycling race as it as a clever marketing job with the most beautiful places of France convincingly filmed by the helicopter crews. Imagine a great director would take over and even further enhance this beauty. To Catch a Thief is just like that. It is a stunning display of the landscapes of South-France, with cars filmed from helicopters, terraces, marinas, skylines filmed from boats. Plot-wise, this is just that, a holiday trip. Nothing serious, but certainly entertaining, optimistic and beautiful. The cinematography here is the most beautiful yet in a Hitchcock movie. The landscapes, cities but also interiors look vivid, sharp yet natural. The costumed ball scene is a beautiful display of colours. The night scenes (with one clumsy obvious day-filmed scene) look mysterious in their green-blueish tint. Directing wise, with regards to composition of the shots, there are other Hitchcocks that are a little better (think Notorious, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Vertigo for example), but he's on fire here too. Compared with the cinematography this is a visual treat. Cary Grant is well-cast, strong here. Of the three movies Hitchcock did with Grace Kelly, this is her best performance. Kelly bursts out of the screen, sensual and eager, charismatic, but always elegant. It's no wonder she became a haunting memory to Hitchcock who was trying to recapture her looks in subsequent movies.

    Is To Catch a Thief among Hitchcock's best? No, in fact I don't even put it in my top 10. Did I expect it to? Again no, it is a very high expectation that can't be applied to every single film he's made(and just for the record as much as he is my favourite director I am not one who says he hasn't made a bad or disappointing film). All I wanted is a good entertaining film to watch, and To Catch a Thief fit that bill more than perfectly. There are times where the pacing, particularly in the middle, does get draggy. However, when so much is so good mostly that is ignorable and can only be noticed when the story gets thin on the ground, which admittedly it can do. Of all of Hitchcock's films, which are all wonderfully made(Jamaica Inn for me was one exception though), To Catch a Thief is one of Hitchcock's most audacious visually. The scenery is just breathtaking and only accentuated by the cinematography, deservedly Oscar-winning, that is both colourful and sweeping. Grace Kelly's wardrobe is glamour personified also. The music is energetic and beautifully orchestrated, fitting perfectly with the visuals and the film's tone. Hitchcock directs superbly, this is not a film that you associate him normally with(light romantic-comedy-thriller rather than suspense-thriller) but it is never jarring and has some of his trademark touches, unlike Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn I didn't have the feeling of this doesn't feel like Hitchcock. His cameo is worth looking out for too, as with all his other cameos in his films. The screenplay sparkles with wit and emotion, helping to at least keep us guessing until the last minute. The playful banter between Grant and Kelly and sexual innuendo are hugely entertaining. The story will entrance people and underwhelm others, while I can definitely understand the latter opinion and there were times where I felt it could have been tighter I was one of those who still found it interesting and involving thanks to the direction, cinematography and the leads' chemistry. There is the odd suspenseful touch, but there is more of an emphasis on the comedic and romantic elements, and both are done beautifully here with the comedy witty and playful and the romance sweet and touching. Cary Grant is very charming and urbane with a touch of arrogance, a side that you are familiar with with him but seeing as it's one that suits him to a tee you don't care. The gorgeous Grace Kelly I don't think has ever looked so beautiful and her droll yet understated performance is every bit as good as her performances in Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. The two have a sparkling chemistry which only adds to the enjoyment. Jessie Royce Landis is deliciously formidable and John Williams, a fine actor deserving of more praise even now, gives sterling support as well. Overall, well worth catching. It's not one of my favourites from Hitchcock and it's not one of his best, but at the same time it's not a film to be properly dismissed either. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to like about this Hitchcock movie, but it is one of the lesser lights in the great run of films he made from 1954 to 1964. The good stuff is obvious, a never-handsomer, suntanned Cary Grant at his easy-going best, Grace Kelly, a less capable actress and the unlikely pursuer of the diffident reformed cat-burglar John Robie character Grant plays, but looking very lovely indeed, some fine, indeed Oscar-winning cinematography from Robert Burks and some typically individual Hitchcock scenes, but there are drawbacks too. The story is slight, the action quite slow-moving, the background music overly-frivolous and intrusive, with too many scenes guilty of running on too long, even the car chase scene is uninvolving and ends dully. The denouement too, lacks suspense and in the end I found myself admiring the skills of the afore-mentioned Grant & Burks than really following the story, which definitely has a puffed-up feel to it. Amongst the memorable scenes Hitchcock delivers this time are the immediate juxtaposition of the robbery victim's scream after the travel-agency tour-type opening title sequence, Grant & Kelly's firework of a kiss and the celebrated "Mother comes too" final shot, but even these aren't in the vanguard of Hitch's very best work. Perhaps this tale of the idle rich didn't engage due to the fecklessness of the leads, but it seems to me having gone to France for the shoot, perhaps the great director got influenced too much by the sunny sky and pretty scenery, giving too much screen time to landscape shots and while the dialogue is occasionally racy, especially during Kelly's seduction of Grant, there's too much of it and too much of it which is superfluous to requirements. Nevertheless as an advertisement for the French Riviera, it does a good job, but as a mystery-thriller it probably doesn't quite make it.

    I really want to love this beautiful film. And it is beautiful. The sets, the colors, even at night, the lighting is just beautiful in every scene. The scenery of Southern France magnificent. The costumes, the gowns, the jewelry in it's sparkling splendor. But it simply isn't enough. I found myself daydreaming. It's dull. There is nothing interesting about the dialog, the script. It is supposed to be witty but it's flat. Some of the characters are supposed to be eccentric, they aren't. I had to fight to pay attention. I love Hitchcock, have seen almost all of his films but honestly, Cary Grant just is about as exciting as cardboard. All I can think of while watching him is, "was he gay?" Grace Kelly is always wonderful but even her part here feels bland. Sorry, just can't recommend this like I would Rear Window, Marnie, Vertigo. Just nothing fascinating here.

    To Catch A Thief is a brilliant classic movie with a terrific story line,a great cast and characters,and plenty of thrills,nothing you wouldn't expect from Alfred Hitchcock,one of the greatest directors of all time.Its definitely not his finest work,or even he scariest,but nothing he has done is bad,that is impossible,two of his main actors,Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,star in this,and this is Grace Kellys final film with Alfred Hitchcock,she will always be a great and very attractive actress,and I will always appreciate her work. John Robie (Cary Grant) is suspected of being the Jewel thief going around his town,but John hasn't robbed anything in fifteen years and must prove his innocence.

    Sometimes a film comes along in which after you've seen it, you felt like you've been on a very nice vacation. Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on a great vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some very likable people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality. These are reasons why we like to go on vacations and these are also reasons why we like going to the movies in the first place. The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka "The Cat", is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and runs a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that "The Cat" is on the prowl again. However, "The Cat" claims that he is innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with "The Cat". Probably the biggest reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this film, between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable her character can be at times. For example, you'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move, either way I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If this film had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Grace Kelly's, but the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to "The Cat", and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of its buildings. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses just pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how great the Technicolor process was during that era. I really love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this film is not a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works seem to be, it's because it doesn't need to be. This film is meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a great story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight.

A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Seeing this described as light-weight Hitchcock was simply wrong. It has a light atmosphere and there are better Hitchcocks, but it is well-paced and is among the the most entertaining Hitchcock movies yet. First off: the landscapes of South-France! When the Tour de France is broadcast, it is as much a display of the cycling race as it as a clever marketing job with the most beautiful places of France convincingly filmed by the helicopter crews. Imagine a great director would take over and even further enhance this beauty. To Catch a Thief is just like that. It is a stunning display of the landscapes of South-France, with cars filmed from helicopters, terraces, marinas, skylines filmed from boats. Plot-wise, this is just that, a holiday trip. Nothing serious, but certainly entertaining, optimistic and beautiful. The cinematography here is the most beautiful yet in a Hitchcock movie. The landscapes, cities but also interiors look vivid, sharp yet natural. The costumed ball scene is a beautiful display of colours. The night scenes (with one clumsy obvious day-filmed scene) look mysterious in their green-blueish tint. Directing wise, with regards to composition of the shots, there are other Hitchcocks that are a little better (think Notorious, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Vertigo for example), but he's on fire here too. Compared with the cinematography this is a visual treat. Cary Grant is well-cast, strong here. Of the three movies Hitchcock did with Grace Kelly, this is her best performance. Kelly bursts out of the screen, sensual and eager, charismatic, but always elegant. It's no wonder she became a haunting memory to Hitchcock who was trying to recapture her looks in subsequent movies.

    Is To Catch a Thief among Hitchcock's best? No, in fact I don't even put it in my top 10. Did I expect it to? Again no, it is a very high expectation that can't be applied to every single film he's made(and just for the record as much as he is my favourite director I am not one who says he hasn't made a bad or disappointing film). All I wanted is a good entertaining film to watch, and To Catch a Thief fit that bill more than perfectly. There are times where the pacing, particularly in the middle, does get draggy. However, when so much is so good mostly that is ignorable and can only be noticed when the story gets thin on the ground, which admittedly it can do. Of all of Hitchcock's films, which are all wonderfully made(Jamaica Inn for me was one exception though), To Catch a Thief is one of Hitchcock's most audacious visually. The scenery is just breathtaking and only accentuated by the cinematography, deservedly Oscar-winning, that is both colourful and sweeping. Grace Kelly's wardrobe is glamour personified also. The music is energetic and beautifully orchestrated, fitting perfectly with the visuals and the film's tone. Hitchcock directs superbly, this is not a film that you associate him normally with(light romantic-comedy-thriller rather than suspense-thriller) but it is never jarring and has some of his trademark touches, unlike Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn I didn't have the feeling of this doesn't feel like Hitchcock. His cameo is worth looking out for too, as with all his other cameos in his films. The screenplay sparkles with wit and emotion, helping to at least keep us guessing until the last minute. The playful banter between Grant and Kelly and sexual innuendo are hugely entertaining. The story will entrance people and underwhelm others, while I can definitely understand the latter opinion and there were times where I felt it could have been tighter I was one of those who still found it interesting and involving thanks to the direction, cinematography and the leads' chemistry. There is the odd suspenseful touch, but there is more of an emphasis on the comedic and romantic elements, and both are done beautifully here with the comedy witty and playful and the romance sweet and touching. Cary Grant is very charming and urbane with a touch of arrogance, a side that you are familiar with with him but seeing as it's one that suits him to a tee you don't care. The gorgeous Grace Kelly I don't think has ever looked so beautiful and her droll yet understated performance is every bit as good as her performances in Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. The two have a sparkling chemistry which only adds to the enjoyment. Jessie Royce Landis is deliciously formidable and John Williams, a fine actor deserving of more praise even now, gives sterling support as well. Overall, well worth catching. It's not one of my favourites from Hitchcock and it's not one of his best, but at the same time it's not a film to be properly dismissed either. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to like about this Hitchcock movie, but it is one of the lesser lights in the great run of films he made from 1954 to 1964. The good stuff is obvious, a never-handsomer, suntanned Cary Grant at his easy-going best, Grace Kelly, a less capable actress and the unlikely pursuer of the diffident reformed cat-burglar John Robie character Grant plays, but looking very lovely indeed, some fine, indeed Oscar-winning cinematography from Robert Burks and some typically individual Hitchcock scenes, but there are drawbacks too. The story is slight, the action quite slow-moving, the background music overly-frivolous and intrusive, with too many scenes guilty of running on too long, even the car chase scene is uninvolving and ends dully. The denouement too, lacks suspense and in the end I found myself admiring the skills of the afore-mentioned Grant & Burks than really following the story, which definitely has a puffed-up feel to it. Amongst the memorable scenes Hitchcock delivers this time are the immediate juxtaposition of the robbery victim's scream after the travel-agency tour-type opening title sequence, Grant & Kelly's firework of a kiss and the celebrated "Mother comes too" final shot, but even these aren't in the vanguard of Hitch's very best work. Perhaps this tale of the idle rich didn't engage due to the fecklessness of the leads, but it seems to me having gone to France for the shoot, perhaps the great director got influenced too much by the sunny sky and pretty scenery, giving too much screen time to landscape shots and while the dialogue is occasionally racy, especially during Kelly's seduction of Grant, there's too much of it and too much of it which is superfluous to requirements. Nevertheless as an advertisement for the French Riviera, it does a good job, but as a mystery-thriller it probably doesn't quite make it.

    I really want to love this beautiful film. And it is beautiful. The sets, the colors, even at night, the lighting is just beautiful in every scene. The scenery of Southern France magnificent. The costumes, the gowns, the jewelry in it's sparkling splendor. But it simply isn't enough. I found myself daydreaming. It's dull. There is nothing interesting about the dialog, the script. It is supposed to be witty but it's flat. Some of the characters are supposed to be eccentric, they aren't. I had to fight to pay attention. I love Hitchcock, have seen almost all of his films but honestly, Cary Grant just is about as exciting as cardboard. All I can think of while watching him is, "was he gay?" Grace Kelly is always wonderful but even her part here feels bland. Sorry, just can't recommend this like I would Rear Window, Marnie, Vertigo. Just nothing fascinating here.

    To Catch A Thief is a brilliant classic movie with a terrific story line,a great cast and characters,and plenty of thrills,nothing you wouldn't expect from Alfred Hitchcock,one of the greatest directors of all time.Its definitely not his finest work,or even he scariest,but nothing he has done is bad,that is impossible,two of his main actors,Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,star in this,and this is Grace Kellys final film with Alfred Hitchcock,she will always be a great and very attractive actress,and I will always appreciate her work. John Robie (Cary Grant) is suspected of being the Jewel thief going around his town,but John hasn't robbed anything in fifteen years and must prove his innocence.

    Sometimes a film comes along in which after you've seen it, you felt like you've been on a very nice vacation. Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on a great vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some very likable people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality. These are reasons why we like to go on vacations and these are also reasons why we like going to the movies in the first place. The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka "The Cat", is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and runs a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that "The Cat" is on the prowl again. However, "The Cat" claims that he is innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with "The Cat". Probably the biggest reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this film, between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable her character can be at times. For example, you'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move, either way I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If this film had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Grace Kelly's, but the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to "The Cat", and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of its buildings. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses just pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how great the Technicolor process was during that era. I really love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this film is not a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works seem to be, it's because it doesn't need to be. This film is meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a great story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight.

    In 1955, Cary Grant came out of retirement to shot To Catch a Thief. The Cat's storyline, which is completely unrefined, suspenseless and tensionless, is in fact just an excuse for what apparently is the true nature of this movie, an uninteresting romance between Grant and Kelly where dialogs are pompous and endless. The script unconvincingly navigates between these two lines, and the disinterest is such that the final outcome, the revelation of the Cat's identity, doesn't trigger anu reaction. Moreover, the movie is filmed in an uninspired way by Hitchcock who relied on a bit too conveniently on the beauty of the Cote d'Azur and its hinterland. A few accelerated shots and a cheap nuit am&eacute;ricaine even arouse a real amazement. There is therefore not much to save from this movie, probably one of Hitchcock's worst, largely overrated by the critics as it is the case with most of the English's productions.

    In some of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films he uses fantastic scenery and backdrops to create a superb visual setting for his films such as the San Francisco backdrop in Vertigo which produced some of the most iconic images in film history with the famous Golden Gate Bridge. "To Catch a Thief" is one of Hitchcock's most superb visual efforts with the film taking place along the French Riviera which allows for some glamorous scenes filled with life and colour, with the film winning an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography". The film picked up an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography" The plot is centred on a famous retired jewel thief the 'Cat' who after a series of robberies is wrongly accused and chased by the police. Cary Grant is brilliant as John Robie (the Cat) who - like in Hitchcock's more famous "North by Northwest" Â– finds himself on the run despite being an innocent man. Grant is brilliant in his role as the calm and cool Robie who attempts to track down the real thief and prove his innocence. Grace Kelly stars as Frances Stevens, a young woman who Robie gets close to as he believes her mother may be the thief's next target and her performance is superb. Some of the most enjoyable scenes in the film come in the middle where we see the two interact with each other; the chemistry is superb with both smart and humorous dialogue between the pair. Hitchcock is known as the 'master of suspense' having created some of the most superb psychological thrillers there is. Although this film may be a thriller it is far from what you may expect from Hitchcock who instead focuses on creating a lighter, more pleasant and beautiful story filled with an enjoyable romance. That's not to say that the film does not have any elements of a usual Hitchcock thriller, after all the film is centred around uncovering the mystery that it the new 'Cat thief' and it's the mystery that makes for some great final scenes along the rooftops of Cannes. I highly recommend "To Catch a Thief", a film that are you are very much likely to enjoy. It's certainly not a Hitchcock classic that is spoke about in the same ilk as the likes of "Vertigo", "Psycho" and others but for what it is, it is a highly likable film that combines great acting, beautiful scenery and a highly enjoyable plot.

    I've just started watching this film on its new DVD format and it's a sight to behold indeed but the plot is the dumbest thing to come down the pike in years! To begin with, we are to believe that Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief, was in prison serving his term when the prison was bombed and he escaped only to join the resistance and become a hero in the process therefore absolving himself of all past crimes. Give me a break! And we are to believe this tripe? I'll watch the rest of it because I am a big Grace Kelly fan and she made so few films but whereas she looks absolutely breathtaking, Grant is way too tanned and almost looks African-American in some scenes. Why they didn't tone him down is something I will never understand. I'm giving it a 5 only because of Grace Kelly but between the absurd plot and Grant's absurd looks a 5 is the best I can do.

    This marked the first time I have seen a Cary Grant film. This is a remarkable confession for a movie guy like myself. The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch. Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a "low-class" thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past. As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka "The Cat", is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and runs a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that "The Cat" is on the prowl again. However, "The Cat" claims that he is innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with "The Cat". Probably the biggest reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this film, between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable her character can be at times. For example, you'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move, either way I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If this film had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Grace Kelly's, but the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to "The Cat", and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of its buildings. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses just pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how great the Technicolor process was during that era. I really love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this film is not a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works seem to be, it's because it doesn't need to be. This film is meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a great story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight.

    In 1955, Cary Grant came out of retirement to shot To Catch a Thief. The Cat's storyline, which is completely unrefined, suspenseless and tensionless, is in fact just an excuse for what apparently is the true nature of this movie, an uninteresting romance between Grant and Kelly where dialogs are pompous and endless. The script unconvincingly navigates between these two lines, and the disinterest is such that the final outcome, the revelation of the Cat's identity, doesn't trigger anu reaction. Moreover, the movie is filmed in an uninspired way by Hitchcock who relied on a bit too conveniently on the beauty of the Cote d'Azur and its hinterland. A few accelerated shots and a cheap nuit am&eacute;ricaine even arouse a real amazement. There is therefore not much to save from this movie, probably one of Hitchcock's worst, largely overrated by the critics as it is the case with most of the English's productions.

    In some of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films he uses fantastic scenery and backdrops to create a superb visual setting for his films such as the San Francisco backdrop in Vertigo which produced some of the most iconic images in film history with the famous Golden Gate Bridge. "To Catch a Thief" is one of Hitchcock's most superb visual efforts with the film taking place along the French Riviera which allows for some glamorous scenes filled with life and colour, with the film winning an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography". The film picked up an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography" The plot is centred on a famous retired jewel thief the 'Cat' who after a series of robberies is wrongly accused and chased by the police. Cary Grant is brilliant as John Robie (the Cat) who - like in Hitchcock's more famous "North by Northwest" Â– finds himself on the run despite being an innocent man. Grant is brilliant in his role as the calm and cool Robie who attempts to track down the real thief and prove his innocence. Grace Kelly stars as Frances Stevens, a young woman who Robie gets close to as he believes her mother may be the thief's next target and her performance is superb. Some of the most enjoyable scenes in the film come in the middle where we see the two interact with each other; the chemistry is superb with both smart and humorous dialogue between the pair. Hitchcock is known as the 'master of suspense' having created some of the most superb psychological thrillers there is. Although this film may be a thriller it is far from what you may expect from Hitchcock who instead focuses on creating a lighter, more pleasant and beautiful story filled with an enjoyable romance. That's not to say that the film does not have any elements of a usual Hitchcock thriller, after all the film is centred around uncovering the mystery that it the new 'Cat thief' and it's the mystery that makes for some great final scenes along the rooftops of Cannes. I highly recommend "To Catch a Thief", a film that are you are very much likely to enjoy. It's certainly not a Hitchcock classic that is spoke about in the same ilk as the likes of "Vertigo", "Psycho" and others but for what it is, it is a highly likable film that combines great acting, beautiful scenery and a highly enjoyable plot.

    I've just started watching this film on its new DVD format and it's a sight to behold indeed but the plot is the dumbest thing to come down the pike in years! To begin with, we are to believe that Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief, was in prison serving his term when the prison was bombed and he escaped only to join the resistance and become a hero in the process therefore absolving himself of all past crimes. Give me a break! And we are to believe this tripe? I'll watch the rest of it because I am a big Grace Kelly fan and she made so few films but whereas she looks absolutely breathtaking, Grant is way too tanned and almost looks African-American in some scenes. Why they didn't tone him down is something I will never understand. I'm giving it a 5 only because of Grace Kelly but between the absurd plot and Grant's absurd looks a 5 is the best I can do.

    This marked the first time I have seen a Cary Grant film. This is a remarkable confession for a movie guy like myself. The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch. Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a "low-class" thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past. As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Seeing this described as light-weight Hitchcock was simply wrong. It has a light atmosphere and there are better Hitchcocks, but it is well-paced and is among the the most entertaining Hitchcock movies yet. First off: the landscapes of South-France! When the Tour de France is broadcast, it is as much a display of the cycling race as it as a clever marketing job with the most beautiful places of France convincingly filmed by the helicopter crews. Imagine a great director would take over and even further enhance this beauty. To Catch a Thief is just like that. It is a stunning display of the landscapes of South-France, with cars filmed from helicopters, terraces, marinas, skylines filmed from boats. Plot-wise, this is just that, a holiday trip. Nothing serious, but certainly entertaining, optimistic and beautiful. The cinematography here is the most beautiful yet in a Hitchcock movie. The landscapes, cities but also interiors look vivid, sharp yet natural. The costumed ball scene is a beautiful display of colours. The night scenes (with one clumsy obvious day-filmed scene) look mysterious in their green-blueish tint. Directing wise, with regards to composition of the shots, there are other Hitchcocks that are a little better (think Notorious, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Vertigo for example), but he's on fire here too. Compared with the cinematography this is a visual treat. Cary Grant is well-cast, strong here. Of the three movies Hitchcock did with Grace Kelly, this is her best performance. Kelly bursts out of the screen, sensual and eager, charismatic, but always elegant. It's no wonder she became a haunting memory to Hitchcock who was trying to recapture her looks in subsequent movies.

    Is To Catch a Thief among Hitchcock's best? No, in fact I don't even put it in my top 10. Did I expect it to? Again no, it is a very high expectation that can't be applied to every single film he's made(and just for the record as much as he is my favourite director I am not one who says he hasn't made a bad or disappointing film). All I wanted is a good entertaining film to watch, and To Catch a Thief fit that bill more than perfectly. There are times where the pacing, particularly in the middle, does get draggy. However, when so much is so good mostly that is ignorable and can only be noticed when the story gets thin on the ground, which admittedly it can do. Of all of Hitchcock's films, which are all wonderfully made(Jamaica Inn for me was one exception though), To Catch a Thief is one of Hitchcock's most audacious visually. The scenery is just breathtaking and only accentuated by the cinematography, deservedly Oscar-winning, that is both colourful and sweeping. Grace Kelly's wardrobe is glamour personified also. The music is energetic and beautifully orchestrated, fitting perfectly with the visuals and the film's tone. Hitchcock directs superbly, this is not a film that you associate him normally with(light romantic-comedy-thriller rather than suspense-thriller) but it is never jarring and has some of his trademark touches, unlike Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn I didn't have the feeling of this doesn't feel like Hitchcock. His cameo is worth looking out for too, as with all his other cameos in his films. The screenplay sparkles with wit and emotion, helping to at least keep us guessing until the last minute. The playful banter between Grant and Kelly and sexual innuendo are hugely entertaining. The story will entrance people and underwhelm others, while I can definitely understand the latter opinion and there were times where I felt it could have been tighter I was one of those who still found it interesting and involving thanks to the direction, cinematography and the leads' chemistry. There is the odd suspenseful touch, but there is more of an emphasis on the comedic and romantic elements, and both are done beautifully here with the comedy witty and playful and the romance sweet and touching. Cary Grant is very charming and urbane with a touch of arrogance, a side that you are familiar with with him but seeing as it's one that suits him to a tee you don't care. The gorgeous Grace Kelly I don't think has ever looked so beautiful and her droll yet understated performance is every bit as good as her performances in Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. The two have a sparkling chemistry which only adds to the enjoyment. Jessie Royce Landis is deliciously formidable and John Williams, a fine actor deserving of more praise even now, gives sterling support as well. Overall, well worth catching. It's not one of my favourites from Hitchcock and it's not one of his best, but at the same time it's not a film to be properly dismissed either. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to like about this Hitchcock movie, but it is one of the lesser lights in the great run of films he made from 1954 to 1964. The good stuff is obvious, a never-handsomer, suntanned Cary Grant at his easy-going best, Grace Kelly, a less capable actress and the unlikely pursuer of the diffident reformed cat-burglar John Robie character Grant plays, but looking very lovely indeed, some fine, indeed Oscar-winning cinematography from Robert Burks and some typically individual Hitchcock scenes, but there are drawbacks too. The story is slight, the action quite slow-moving, the background music overly-frivolous and intrusive, with too many scenes guilty of running on too long, even the car chase scene is uninvolving and ends dully. The denouement too, lacks suspense and in the end I found myself admiring the skills of the afore-mentioned Grant & Burks than really following the story, which definitely has a puffed-up feel to it. Amongst the memorable scenes Hitchcock delivers this time are the immediate juxtaposition of the robbery victim's scream after the travel-agency tour-type opening title sequence, Grant & Kelly's firework of a kiss and the celebrated "Mother comes too" final shot, but even these aren't in the vanguard of Hitch's very best work. Perhaps this tale of the idle rich didn't engage due to the fecklessness of the leads, but it seems to me having gone to France for the shoot, perhaps the great director got influenced too much by the sunny sky and pretty scenery, giving too much screen time to landscape shots and while the dialogue is occasionally racy, especially during Kelly's seduction of Grant, there's too much of it and too much of it which is superfluous to requirements. Nevertheless as an advertisement for the French Riviera, it does a good job, but as a mystery-thriller it probably doesn't quite make it.

    I really want to love this beautiful film. And it is beautiful. The sets, the colors, even at night, the lighting is just beautiful in every scene. The scenery of Southern France magnificent. The costumes, the gowns, the jewelry in it's sparkling splendor. But it simply isn't enough. I found myself daydreaming. It's dull. There is nothing interesting about the dialog, the script. It is supposed to be witty but it's flat. Some of the characters are supposed to be eccentric, they aren't. I had to fight to pay attention. I love Hitchcock, have seen almost all of his films but honestly, Cary Grant just is about as exciting as cardboard. All I can think of while watching him is, "was he gay?" Grace Kelly is always wonderful but even her part here feels bland. Sorry, just can't recommend this like I would Rear Window, Marnie, Vertigo. Just nothing fascinating here.

    To Catch A Thief is a brilliant classic movie with a terrific story line,a great cast and characters,and plenty of thrills,nothing you wouldn't expect from Alfred Hitchcock,one of the greatest directors of all time.Its definitely not his finest work,or even he scariest,but nothing he has done is bad,that is impossible,two of his main actors,Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,star in this,and this is Grace Kellys final film with Alfred Hitchcock,she will always be a great and very attractive actress,and I will always appreciate her work. John Robie (Cary Grant) is suspected of being the Jewel thief going around his town,but John hasn't robbed anything in fifteen years and must prove his innocence.

    Sometimes a film comes along in which after you've seen it, you felt like you've been on a very nice vacation. Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on a great vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some very likable people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality.

Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Seeing this described as light-weight Hitchcock was simply wrong. It has a light atmosphere and there are better Hitchcocks, but it is well-paced and is among the the most entertaining Hitchcock movies yet. First off: the landscapes of South-France! When the Tour de France is broadcast, it is as much a display of the cycling race as it as a clever marketing job with the most beautiful places of France convincingly filmed by the helicopter crews. Imagine a great director would take over and even further enhance this beauty. To Catch a Thief is just like that. It is a stunning display of the landscapes of South-France, with cars filmed from helicopters, terraces, marinas, skylines filmed from boats. Plot-wise, this is just that, a holiday trip. Nothing serious, but certainly entertaining, optimistic and beautiful. The cinematography here is the most beautiful yet in a Hitchcock movie. The landscapes, cities but also interiors look vivid, sharp yet natural. The costumed ball scene is a beautiful display of colours. The night scenes (with one clumsy obvious day-filmed scene) look mysterious in their green-blueish tint. Directing wise, with regards to composition of the shots, there are other Hitchcocks that are a little better (think Notorious, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Vertigo for example), but he's on fire here too. Compared with the cinematography this is a visual treat. Cary Grant is well-cast, strong here. Of the three movies Hitchcock did with Grace Kelly, this is her best performance. Kelly bursts out of the screen, sensual and eager, charismatic, but always elegant. It's no wonder she became a haunting memory to Hitchcock who was trying to recapture her looks in subsequent movies.

    Is To Catch a Thief among Hitchcock's best? No, in fact I don't even put it in my top 10. Did I expect it to? Again no, it is a very high expectation that can't be applied to every single film he's made(and just for the record as much as he is my favourite director I am not one who says he hasn't made a bad or disappointing film). All I wanted is a good entertaining film to watch, and To Catch a Thief fit that bill more than perfectly. There are times where the pacing, particularly in the middle, does get draggy. However, when so much is so good mostly that is ignorable and can only be noticed when the story gets thin on the ground, which admittedly it can do. Of all of Hitchcock's films, which are all wonderfully made(Jamaica Inn for me was one exception though), To Catch a Thief is one of Hitchcock's most audacious visually. The scenery is just breathtaking and only accentuated by the cinematography, deservedly Oscar-winning, that is both colourful and sweeping. Grace Kelly's wardrobe is glamour personified also. The music is energetic and beautifully orchestrated, fitting perfectly with the visuals and the film's tone. Hitchcock directs superbly, this is not a film that you associate him normally with(light romantic-comedy-thriller rather than suspense-thriller) but it is never jarring and has some of his trademark touches, unlike Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn I didn't have the feeling of this doesn't feel like Hitchcock. His cameo is worth looking out for too, as with all his other cameos in his films. The screenplay sparkles with wit and emotion, helping to at least keep us guessing until the last minute. The playful banter between Grant and Kelly and sexual innuendo are hugely entertaining. The story will entrance people and underwhelm others, while I can definitely understand the latter opinion and there were times where I felt it could have been tighter I was one of those who still found it interesting and involving thanks to the direction, cinematography and the leads' chemistry. There is the odd suspenseful touch, but there is more of an emphasis on the comedic and romantic elements, and both are done beautifully here with the comedy witty and playful and the romance sweet and touching. Cary Grant is very charming and urbane with a touch of arrogance, a side that you are familiar with with him but seeing as it's one that suits him to a tee you don't care. The gorgeous Grace Kelly I don't think has ever looked so beautiful and her droll yet understated performance is every bit as good as her performances in Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. The two have a sparkling chemistry which only adds to the enjoyment. Jessie Royce Landis is deliciously formidable and John Williams, a fine actor deserving of more praise even now, gives sterling support as well. Overall, well worth catching. It's not one of my favourites from Hitchcock and it's not one of his best, but at the same time it's not a film to be properly dismissed either. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to like about this Hitchcock movie, but it is one of the lesser lights in the great run of films he made from 1954 to 1964. The good stuff is obvious, a never-handsomer, suntanned Cary Grant at his easy-going best, Grace Kelly, a less capable actress and the unlikely pursuer of the diffident reformed cat-burglar John Robie character Grant plays, but looking very lovely indeed, some fine, indeed Oscar-winning cinematography from Robert Burks and some typically individual Hitchcock scenes, but there are drawbacks too. The story is slight, the action quite slow-moving, the background music overly-frivolous and intrusive, with too many scenes guilty of running on too long, even the car chase scene is uninvolving and ends dully. The denouement too, lacks suspense and in the end I found myself admiring the skills of the afore-mentioned Grant & Burks than really following the story, which definitely has a puffed-up feel to it. Amongst the memorable scenes Hitchcock delivers this time are the immediate juxtaposition of the robbery victim's scream after the travel-agency tour-type opening title sequence, Grant & Kelly's firework of a kiss and the celebrated "Mother comes too" final shot, but even these aren't in the vanguard of Hitch's very best work. Perhaps this tale of the idle rich didn't engage due to the fecklessness of the leads, but it seems to me having gone to France for the shoot, perhaps the great director got influenced too much by the sunny sky and pretty scenery, giving too much screen time to landscape shots and while the dialogue is occasionally racy, especially during Kelly's seduction of Grant, there's too much of it and too much of it which is superfluous to requirements. Nevertheless as an advertisement for the French Riviera, it does a good job, but as a mystery-thriller it probably doesn't quite make it.

    I really want to love this beautiful film. And it is beautiful. The sets, the colors, even at night, the lighting is just beautiful in every scene. The scenery of Southern France magnificent. The costumes, the gowns, the jewelry in it's sparkling splendor. But it simply isn't enough. I found myself daydreaming. It's dull. There is nothing interesting about the dialog, the script. It is supposed to be witty but it's flat. Some of the characters are supposed to be eccentric, they aren't. I had to fight to pay attention. I love Hitchcock, have seen almost all of his films but honestly, Cary Grant just is about as exciting as cardboard. All I can think of while watching him is, "was he gay?" Grace Kelly is always wonderful but even her part here feels bland. Sorry, just can't recommend this like I would Rear Window, Marnie, Vertigo. Just nothing fascinating here.

John Robie (Cary Grant) is suspected of being the Jewel thief going around his town,but John hasn't robbed anything in fifteen years and must prove his innocence.

    Sometimes a film comes along in which after you've seen it, you felt like you've been on a very nice vacation. Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on a great vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some very likable people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality. These are reasons why we like to go on vacations and these are also reasons why we like going to the movies in the first place. The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka "The Cat", is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and runs a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that "The Cat" is on the prowl again. However, "The Cat" claims that he is innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with "The Cat". Probably the biggest reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this film, between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable her character can be at times. For example, you'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move, either way I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If this film had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Grace Kelly's, but the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to "The Cat", and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of its buildings. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses just pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how great the Technicolor process was during that era. I really love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this film is not a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works seem to be, it's because it doesn't need to be. This film is meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a great story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight.

    In 1955, Cary Grant came out of retirement to shot To Catch a Thief. The Cat's storyline, which is completely unrefined, suspenseless and tensionless, is in fact just an excuse for what apparently is the true nature of this movie, an uninteresting romance between Grant and Kelly where dialogs are pompous and endless. The script unconvincingly navigates between these two lines, and the disinterest is such that the final outcome, the revelation of the Cat's identity, doesn't trigger anu reaction. Moreover, the movie is filmed in an uninspired way by Hitchcock who relied on a bit too conveniently on the beauty of the Cote d'Azur and its hinterland. A few accelerated shots and a cheap nuit am&eacute;ricaine even arouse a real amazement. There is therefore not much to save from this movie, probably one of Hitchcock's worst, largely overrated by the critics as it is the case with most of the English's productions.

    In some of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films he uses fantastic scenery and backdrops to create a superb visual setting for his films such as the San Francisco backdrop in Vertigo which produced some of the most iconic images in film history with the famous Golden Gate Bridge. "To Catch a Thief" is one of Hitchcock's most superb visual efforts with the film taking place along the French Riviera which allows for some glamorous scenes filled with life and colour, with the film winning an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography". The film picked up an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography" The plot is centred on a famous retired jewel thief the 'Cat' who after a series of robberies is wrongly accused and chased by the police. Cary Grant is brilliant as John Robie (the Cat) who - like in Hitchcock's more famous "North by Northwest" Â– finds himself on the run despite being an innocent man. Grant is brilliant in his role as the calm and cool Robie who attempts to track down the real thief and prove his innocence. Grace Kelly stars as Frances Stevens, a young woman who Robie gets close to as he believes her mother may be the thief's next target and her performance is superb. Some of the most enjoyable scenes in the film come in the middle where we see the two interact with each other; the chemistry is superb with both smart and humorous dialogue between the pair. Hitchcock is known as the 'master of suspense' having created some of the most superb psychological thrillers there is. Although this film may be a thriller it is far from what you may expect from Hitchcock who instead focuses on creating a lighter, more pleasant and beautiful story filled with an enjoyable romance. That's not to say that the film does not have any elements of a usual Hitchcock thriller, after all the film is centred around uncovering the mystery that it the new 'Cat thief' and it's the mystery that makes for some great final scenes along the rooftops of Cannes. I highly recommend "To Catch a Thief", a film that are you are very much likely to enjoy. It's certainly not a Hitchcock classic that is spoke about in the same ilk as the likes of "Vertigo", "Psycho" and others but for what it is, it is a highly likable film that combines great acting, beautiful scenery and a highly enjoyable plot.

    I've just started watching this film on its new DVD format and it's a sight to behold indeed but the plot is the dumbest thing to come down the pike in years! To begin with, we are to believe that Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief, was in prison serving his term when the prison was bombed and he escaped only to join the resistance and become a hero in the process therefore absolving himself of all past crimes. Give me a break! And we are to believe this tripe? I'll watch the rest of it because I am a big Grace Kelly fan and she made so few films but whereas she looks absolutely breathtaking, Grant is way too tanned and almost looks African-American in some scenes. Why they didn't tone him down is something I will never understand. I'm giving it a 5 only because of Grace Kelly but between the absurd plot and Grant's absurd looks a 5 is the best I can do.

    This marked the first time I have seen a Cary Grant film. This is a remarkable confession for a movie guy like myself. The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch. Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a "low-class" thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past. As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Sometimes a film comes along in which after you've seen it, you felt like you've been on a very nice vacation. Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on a great vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some very likable people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality. These are reasons why we like to go on vacations and these are also reasons why we like going to the movies in the first place. The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka "The Cat", is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and runs a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that "The Cat" is on the prowl again. However, "The Cat" claims that he is innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with "The Cat". Probably the biggest reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this film, between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable her character can be at times. For example, you'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move, either way I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If this film had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Grace Kelly's, but the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to "The Cat", and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of its buildings. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses just pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how great the Technicolor process was during that era. I really love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this film is not a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works seem to be, it's because it doesn't need to be. This film is meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a great story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight.

    In 1955, Cary Grant came out of retirement to shot To Catch a Thief. The Cat's storyline, which is completely unrefined, suspenseless and tensionless, is in fact just an excuse for what apparently is the true nature of this movie, an uninteresting romance between Grant and Kelly where dialogs are pompous and endless. The script unconvincingly navigates between these two lines, and the disinterest is such that the final outcome, the revelation of the Cat's identity, doesn't trigger anu reaction. Moreover, the movie is filmed in an uninspired way by Hitchcock who relied on a bit too conveniently on the beauty of the Cote d'Azur and its hinterland. A few accelerated shots and a cheap nuit am&eacute;ricaine even arouse a real amazement. There is therefore not much to save from this movie, probably one of Hitchcock's worst, largely overrated by the critics as it is the case with most of the English's productions.

    In some of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films he uses fantastic scenery and backdrops to create a superb visual setting for his films such as the San Francisco backdrop in Vertigo which produced some of the most iconic images in film history with the famous Golden Gate Bridge. "To Catch a Thief" is one of Hitchcock's most superb visual efforts with the film taking place along the French Riviera which allows for some glamorous scenes filled with life and colour, with the film winning an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography". The film picked up an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography" The plot is centred on a famous retired jewel thief the 'Cat' who after a series of robberies is wrongly accused and chased by the police. Cary Grant is brilliant as John Robie (the Cat) who - like in Hitchcock's more famous "North by Northwest" Â– finds himself on the run despite being an innocent man. Grant is brilliant in his role as the calm and cool Robie who attempts to track down the real thief and prove his innocence. Grace Kelly stars as Frances Stevens, a young woman who Robie gets close to as he believes her mother may be the thief's next target and her performance is superb. Some of the most enjoyable scenes in the film come in the middle where we see the two interact with each other; the chemistry is superb with both smart and humorous dialogue between the pair. Hitchcock is known as the 'master of suspense' having created some of the most superb psychological thrillers there is. Although this film may be a thriller it is far from what you may expect from Hitchcock who instead focuses on creating a lighter, more pleasant and beautiful story filled with an enjoyable romance. That's not to say that the film does not have any elements of a usual Hitchcock thriller, after all the film is centred around uncovering the mystery that it the new 'Cat thief' and it's the mystery that makes for some great final scenes along the rooftops of Cannes. I highly recommend "To Catch a Thief", a film that are you are very much likely to enjoy. It's certainly not a Hitchcock classic that is spoke about in the same ilk as the likes of "Vertigo", "Psycho" and others but for what it is, it is a highly likable film that combines great acting, beautiful scenery and a highly enjoyable plot.

    I've just started watching this film on its new DVD format and it's a sight to behold indeed but the plot is the dumbest thing to come down the pike in years! To begin with, we are to believe that Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief, was in prison serving his term when the prison was bombed and he escaped only to join the resistance and become a hero in the process therefore absolving himself of all past crimes. Give me a break! And we are to believe this tripe? I'll watch the rest of it because I am a big Grace Kelly fan and she made so few films but whereas she looks absolutely breathtaking, Grant is way too tanned and almost looks African-American in some scenes. Why they didn't tone him down is something I will never understand. I'm giving it a 5 only because of Grace Kelly but between the absurd plot and Grant's absurd looks a 5 is the best I can do.

    This marked the first time I have seen a Cary Grant film. This is a remarkable confession for a movie guy like myself. The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch. Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a "low-class" thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past. As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Seeing this described as light-weight Hitchcock was simply wrong. It has a light atmosphere and there are better Hitchcocks, but it is well-paced and is among the the most entertaining Hitchcock movies yet. First off: the landscapes of South-France! When the Tour de France is broadcast, it is as much a display of the cycling race as it as a clever marketing job with the most beautiful places of France convincingly filmed by the helicopter crews. Imagine a great director would take over and even further enhance this beauty. To Catch a Thief is just like that. It is a stunning display of the landscapes of South-France, with cars filmed from helicopters, terraces, marinas, skylines filmed from boats. Plot-wise, this is just that, a holiday trip. Nothing serious, but certainly entertaining, optimistic and beautiful. The cinematography here is the most beautiful yet in a Hitchcock movie. The landscapes, cities but also interiors look vivid, sharp yet natural. The costumed ball scene is a beautiful display of colours. The night scenes (with one clumsy obvious day-filmed scene) look mysterious in their green-blueish tint. Directing wise, with regards to composition of the shots, there are other Hitchcocks that are a little better (think Notorious, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Vertigo for example), but he's on fire here too. Compared with the cinematography this is a visual treat. Cary Grant is well-cast, strong here. Of the three movies Hitchcock did with Grace Kelly, this is her best performance. Kelly bursts out of the screen, sensual and eager, charismatic, but always elegant. It's no wonder she became a haunting memory to Hitchcock who was trying to recapture her looks in subsequent movies.

    Is To Catch a Thief among Hitchcock's best? No, in fact I don't even put it in my top 10. Did I expect it to? Again no, it is a very high expectation that can't be applied to every single film he's made(and just for the record as much as he is my favourite director I am not one who says he hasn't made a bad or disappointing film). All I wanted is a good entertaining film to watch, and To Catch a Thief fit that bill more than perfectly. There are times where the pacing, particularly in the middle, does get draggy. However, when so much is so good mostly that is ignorable and can only be noticed when the story gets thin on the ground, which admittedly it can do. Of all of Hitchcock's films, which are all wonderfully made(Jamaica Inn for me was one exception though), To Catch a Thief is one of Hitchcock's most audacious visually. The scenery is just breathtaking and only accentuated by the cinematography, deservedly Oscar-winning, that is both colourful and sweeping. Grace Kelly's wardrobe is glamour personified also. The music is energetic and beautifully orchestrated, fitting perfectly with the visuals and the film's tone. Hitchcock directs superbly, this is not a film that you associate him normally with(light romantic-comedy-thriller rather than suspense-thriller) but it is never jarring and has some of his trademark touches, unlike Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn I didn't have the feeling of this doesn't feel like Hitchcock. His cameo is worth looking out for too, as with all his other cameos in his films. The screenplay sparkles with wit and emotion, helping to at least keep us guessing until the last minute. The playful banter between Grant and Kelly and sexual innuendo are hugely entertaining. The story will entrance people and underwhelm others, while I can definitely understand the latter opinion and there were times where I felt it could have been tighter I was one of those who still found it interesting and involving thanks to the direction, cinematography and the leads' chemistry. There is the odd suspenseful touch, but there is more of an emphasis on the comedic and romantic elements, and both are done beautifully here with the comedy witty and playful and the romance sweet and touching. Cary Grant is very charming and urbane with a touch of arrogance, a side that you are familiar with with him but seeing as it's one that suits him to a tee you don't care. The gorgeous Grace Kelly I don't think has ever looked so beautiful and her droll yet understated performance is every bit as good as her performances in Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. The two have a sparkling chemistry which only adds to the enjoyment. Jessie Royce Landis is deliciously formidable and John Williams, a fine actor deserving of more praise even now, gives sterling support as well. Overall, well worth catching. It's not one of my favourites from Hitchcock and it's not one of his best, but at the same time it's not a film to be properly dismissed either. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to like about this Hitchcock movie, but it is one of the lesser lights in the great run of films he made from 1954 to 1964. The good stuff is obvious, a never-handsomer, suntanned Cary Grant at his easy-going best, Grace Kelly, a less capable actress and the unlikely pursuer of the diffident reformed cat-burglar John Robie character Grant plays, but looking very lovely indeed, some fine, indeed Oscar-winning cinematography from Robert Burks and some typically individual Hitchcock scenes, but there are drawbacks too. The story is slight, the action quite slow-moving, the background music overly-frivolous and intrusive, with too many scenes guilty of running on too long, even the car chase scene is uninvolving and ends dully. The denouement too, lacks suspense and in the end I found myself admiring the skills of the afore-mentioned Grant & Burks than really following the story, which definitely has a puffed-up feel to it. Amongst the memorable scenes Hitchcock delivers this time are the immediate juxtaposition of the robbery victim's scream after the travel-agency tour-type opening title sequence, Grant & Kelly's firework of a kiss and the celebrated "Mother comes too" final shot, but even these aren't in the vanguard of Hitch's very best work. Perhaps this tale of the idle rich didn't engage due to the fecklessness of the leads, but it seems to me having gone to France for the shoot, perhaps the great director got influenced too much by the sunny sky and pretty scenery, giving too much screen time to landscape shots and while the dialogue is occasionally racy, especially during Kelly's seduction of Grant, there's too much of it and too much of it which is superfluous to requirements. Nevertheless as an advertisement for the French Riviera, it does a good job, but as a mystery-thriller it probably doesn't quite make it.

    I really want to love this beautiful film. And it is beautiful. The sets, the colors, even at night, the lighting is just beautiful in every scene. The scenery of Southern France magnificent. The costumes, the gowns, the jewelry in it's sparkling splendor. But it simply isn't enough. I found myself daydreaming. It's dull. There is nothing interesting about the dialog, the script. It is supposed to be witty but it's flat. Some of the characters are supposed to be eccentric, they aren't. I had to fight to pay attention. I love Hitchcock, have seen almost all of his films but honestly, Cary Grant just is about as exciting as cardboard. All I can think of while watching him is, "was he gay?" Grace Kelly is always wonderful but even her part here feels bland. Sorry, just can't recommend this like I would Rear Window, Marnie, Vertigo. Just nothing fascinating here.

    To Catch A Thief is a brilliant classic movie with a terrific story line,a great cast and characters,and plenty of thrills,nothing you wouldn't expect from Alfred Hitchcock,one of the greatest directors of all time.Its definitely not his finest work,or even he scariest,but nothing he has done is bad,that is impossible,two of his main actors,Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,star in this,and this is Grace Kellys final film with Alfred Hitchcock,she will always be a great and very attractive actress,and I will always appreciate her work. John Robie (Cary Grant) is suspected of being the Jewel thief going around his town,but John hasn't robbed anything in fifteen years and must prove his innocence.

I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past. As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Seeing this described as light-weight Hitchcock was simply wrong. It has a light atmosphere and there are better Hitchcocks, but it is well-paced and is among the the most entertaining Hitchcock movies yet. First off: the landscapes of South-France! When the Tour de France is broadcast, it is as much a display of the cycling race as it as a clever marketing job with the most beautiful places of France convincingly filmed by the helicopter crews. Imagine a great director would take over and even further enhance this beauty. To Catch a Thief is just like that. It is a stunning display of the landscapes of South-France, with cars filmed from helicopters, terraces, marinas, skylines filmed from boats. Plot-wise, this is just that, a holiday trip. Nothing serious, but certainly entertaining, optimistic and beautiful. The cinematography here is the most beautiful yet in a Hitchcock movie. The landscapes, cities but also interiors look vivid, sharp yet natural. The costumed ball scene is a beautiful display of colours. The night scenes (with one clumsy obvious day-filmed scene) look mysterious in their green-blueish tint. Directing wise, with regards to composition of the shots, there are other Hitchcocks that are a little better (think Notorious, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Vertigo for example), but he's on fire here too. Compared with the cinematography this is a visual treat. Cary Grant is well-cast, strong here. Of the three movies Hitchcock did with Grace Kelly, this is her best performance. Kelly bursts out of the screen, sensual and eager, charismatic, but always elegant. It's no wonder she became a haunting memory to Hitchcock who was trying to recapture her looks in subsequent movies.

    Is To Catch a Thief among Hitchcock's best? No, in fact I don't even put it in my top 10. Did I expect it to? Again no, it is a very high expectation that can't be applied to every single film he's made(and just for the record as much as he is my favourite director I am not one who says he hasn't made a bad or disappointing film). All I wanted is a good entertaining film to watch, and To Catch a Thief fit that bill more than perfectly. There are times where the pacing, particularly in the middle, does get draggy. However, when so much is so good mostly that is ignorable and can only be noticed when the story gets thin on the ground, which admittedly it can do. Of all of Hitchcock's films, which are all wonderfully made(Jamaica Inn for me was one exception though), To Catch a Thief is one of Hitchcock's most audacious visually. The scenery is just breathtaking and only accentuated by the cinematography, deservedly Oscar-winning, that is both colourful and sweeping. Grace Kelly's wardrobe is glamour personified also. The music is energetic and beautifully orchestrated, fitting perfectly with the visuals and the film's tone. Hitchcock directs superbly, this is not a film that you associate him normally with(light romantic-comedy-thriller rather than suspense-thriller) but it is never jarring and has some of his trademark touches, unlike Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn I didn't have the feeling of this doesn't feel like Hitchcock. His cameo is worth looking out for too, as with all his other cameos in his films. The screenplay sparkles with wit and emotion, helping to at least keep us guessing until the last minute. The playful banter between Grant and Kelly and sexual innuendo are hugely entertaining. The story will entrance people and underwhelm others, while I can definitely understand the latter opinion and there were times where I felt it could have been tighter I was one of those who still found it interesting and involving thanks to the direction, cinematography and the leads' chemistry. There is the odd suspenseful touch, but there is more of an emphasis on the comedic and romantic elements, and both are done beautifully here with the comedy witty and playful and the romance sweet and touching. Cary Grant is very charming and urbane with a touch of arrogance, a side that you are familiar with with him but seeing as it's one that suits him to a tee you don't care. The gorgeous Grace Kelly I don't think has ever looked so beautiful and her droll yet understated performance is every bit as good as her performances in Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. The two have a sparkling chemistry which only adds to the enjoyment. Jessie Royce Landis is deliciously formidable and John Williams, a fine actor deserving of more praise even now, gives sterling support as well. Overall, well worth catching. It's not one of my favourites from Hitchcock and it's not one of his best, but at the same time it's not a film to be properly dismissed either. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to like about this Hitchcock movie, but it is one of the lesser lights in the great run of films he made from 1954 to 1964. The good stuff is obvious, a never-handsomer, suntanned Cary Grant at his easy-going best, Grace Kelly, a less capable actress and the unlikely pursuer of the diffident reformed cat-burglar John Robie character Grant plays, but looking very lovely indeed, some fine, indeed Oscar-winning cinematography from Robert Burks and some typically individual Hitchcock scenes, but there are drawbacks too. The story is slight, the action quite slow-moving, the background music overly-frivolous and intrusive, with too many scenes guilty of running on too long, even the car chase scene is uninvolving and ends dully. The denouement too, lacks suspense and in the end I found myself admiring the skills of the afore-mentioned Grant & Burks than really following the story, which definitely has a puffed-up feel to it. Amongst the memorable scenes Hitchcock delivers this time are the immediate juxtaposition of the robbery victim's scream after the travel-agency tour-type opening title sequence, Grant & Kelly's firework of a kiss and the celebrated "Mother comes too" final shot, but even these aren't in the vanguard of Hitch's very best work. Perhaps this tale of the idle rich didn't engage due to the fecklessness of the leads, but it seems to me having gone to France for the shoot, perhaps the great director got influenced too much by the sunny sky and pretty scenery, giving too much screen time to landscape shots and while the dialogue is occasionally racy, especially during Kelly's seduction of Grant, there's too much of it and too much of it which is superfluous to requirements. Nevertheless as an advertisement for the French Riviera, it does a good job, but as a mystery-thriller it probably doesn't quite make it.

    I really want to love this beautiful film. And it is beautiful. The sets, the colors, even at night, the lighting is just beautiful in every scene. The scenery of Southern France magnificent. The costumes, the gowns, the jewelry in it's sparkling splendor. But it simply isn't enough. I found myself daydreaming. It's dull. There is nothing interesting about the dialog, the script. It is supposed to be witty but it's flat. Some of the characters are supposed to be eccentric, they aren't. I had to fight to pay attention. I love Hitchcock, have seen almost all of his films but honestly, Cary Grant just is about as exciting as cardboard. All I can think of while watching him is, "was he gay?" Grace Kelly is always wonderful but even her part here feels bland. Sorry, just can't recommend this like I would Rear Window, Marnie, Vertigo. Just nothing fascinating here.

    Sometimes a film comes along in which after you've seen it, you felt like you've been on a very nice vacation. Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on a great vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some very likable people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality. These are reasons why we like to go on vacations and these are also reasons why we like going to the movies in the first place. The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka "The Cat", is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and runs a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that "The Cat" is on the prowl again. However, "The Cat" claims that he is innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with "The Cat". Probably the biggest reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this film, between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable her character can be at times. For example, you'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move, either way I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If this film had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Grace Kelly's, but the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to "The Cat", and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of its buildings. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses just pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how great the Technicolor process was during that era. I really love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this film is not a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works seem to be, it's because it doesn't need to be. This film is meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a great story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight.

    In 1955, Cary Grant came out of retirement to shot To Catch a Thief. The Cat's storyline, which is completely unrefined, suspenseless and tensionless, is in fact just an excuse for what apparently is the true nature of this movie, an uninteresting romance between Grant and Kelly where dialogs are pompous and endless. The script unconvincingly navigates between these two lines, and the disinterest is such that the final outcome, the revelation of the Cat's identity, doesn't trigger anu reaction. Moreover, the movie is filmed in an uninspired way by Hitchcock who relied on a bit too conveniently on the beauty of the Cote d'Azur and its hinterland. A few accelerated shots and a cheap nuit am&eacute;ricaine even arouse a real amazement. There is therefore not much to save from this movie, probably one of Hitchcock's worst, largely overrated by the critics as it is the case with most of the English's productions.

    In some of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films he uses fantastic scenery and backdrops to create a superb visual setting for his films such as the San Francisco backdrop in Vertigo which produced some of the most iconic images in film history with the famous Golden Gate Bridge. "To Catch a Thief" is one of Hitchcock's most superb visual efforts with the film taking place along the French Riviera which allows for some glamorous scenes filled with life and colour, with the film winning an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography". The film picked up an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography" The plot is centred on a famous retired jewel thief the 'Cat' who after a series of robberies is wrongly accused and chased by the police. Cary Grant is brilliant as John Robie (the Cat) who - like in Hitchcock's more famous "North by Northwest" Â– finds himself on the run despite being an innocent man. Grant is brilliant in his role as the calm and cool Robie who attempts to track down the real thief and prove his innocence. Grace Kelly stars as Frances Stevens, a young woman who Robie gets close to as he believes her mother may be the thief's next target and her performance is superb. Some of the most enjoyable scenes in the film come in the middle where we see the two interact with each other; the chemistry is superb with both smart and humorous dialogue between the pair. Hitchcock is known as the 'master of suspense' having created some of the most superb psychological thrillers there is. Although this film may be a thriller it is far from what you may expect from Hitchcock who instead focuses on creating a lighter, more pleasant and beautiful story filled with an enjoyable romance. That's not to say that the film does not have any elements of a usual Hitchcock thriller, after all the film is centred around uncovering the mystery that it the new 'Cat thief' and it's the mystery that makes for some great final scenes along the rooftops of Cannes. I highly recommend "To Catch a Thief", a film that are you are very much likely to enjoy. It's certainly not a Hitchcock classic that is spoke about in the same ilk as the likes of "Vertigo", "Psycho" and others but for what it is, it is a highly likable film that combines great acting, beautiful scenery and a highly enjoyable plot.

    I've just started watching this film on its new DVD format and it's a sight to behold indeed but the plot is the dumbest thing to come down the pike in years! To begin with, we are to believe that Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief, was in prison serving his term when the prison was bombed and he escaped only to join the resistance and become a hero in the process therefore absolving himself of all past crimes. Give me a break! And we are to believe this tripe? I'll watch the rest of it because I am a big Grace Kelly fan and she made so few films but whereas she looks absolutely breathtaking, Grant is way too tanned and almost looks African-American in some scenes. Why they didn't tone him down is something I will never understand. I'm giving it a 5 only because of Grace Kelly but between the absurd plot and Grant's absurd looks a 5 is the best I can do.

    This marked the first time I have seen a Cary Grant film. This is a remarkable confession for a movie guy like myself. The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch. Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a "low-class" thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past. As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Sometimes a film comes along in which after you've seen it, you felt like you've been on a very nice vacation. Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on a great vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some very likable people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality. These are reasons why we like to go on vacations and these are also reasons why we like going to the movies in the first place. The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka "The Cat", is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and runs a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that "The Cat" is on the prowl again. However, "The Cat" claims that he is innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with "The Cat". Probably the biggest reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this film, between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable her character can be at times. For example, you'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move, either way I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If this film had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Grace Kelly's, but the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to "The Cat", and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of its buildings. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses just pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how great the Technicolor process was during that era. I really love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this film is not a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works seem to be, it's because it doesn't need to be. This film is meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a great story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight.

    In 1955, Cary Grant came out of retirement to shot To Catch a Thief. The Cat's storyline, which is completely unrefined, suspenseless and tensionless, is in fact just an excuse for what apparently is the true nature of this movie, an uninteresting romance between Grant and Kelly where dialogs are pompous and endless. The script unconvincingly navigates between these two lines, and the disinterest is such that the final outcome, the revelation of the Cat's identity, doesn't trigger anu reaction. Moreover, the movie is filmed in an uninspired way by Hitchcock who relied on a bit too conveniently on the beauty of the Cote d'Azur and its hinterland. A few accelerated shots and a cheap nuit am&eacute;ricaine even arouse a real amazement. There is therefore not much to save from this movie, probably one of Hitchcock's worst, largely overrated by the critics as it is the case with most of the English's productions.

    In some of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films he uses fantastic scenery and backdrops to create a superb visual setting for his films such as the San Francisco backdrop in Vertigo which produced some of the most iconic images in film history with the famous Golden Gate Bridge. "To Catch a Thief" is one of Hitchcock's most superb visual efforts with the film taking place along the French Riviera which allows for some glamorous scenes filled with life and colour, with the film winning an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography". The film picked up an Oscar award for "Best Color Cinematography" The plot is centred on a famous retired jewel thief the 'Cat' who after a series of robberies is wrongly accused and chased by the police. Cary Grant is brilliant as John Robie (the Cat) who - like in Hitchcock's more famous "North by Northwest" Â– finds himself on the run despite being an innocent man. Grant is brilliant in his role as the calm and cool Robie who attempts to track down the real thief and prove his innocence. Grace Kelly stars as Frances Stevens, a young woman who Robie gets close to as he believes her mother may be the thief's next target and her performance is superb. Some of the most enjoyable scenes in the film come in the middle where we see the two interact with each other; the chemistry is superb with both smart and humorous dialogue between the pair. Hitchcock is known as the 'master of suspense' having created some of the most superb psychological thrillers there is. Although this film may be a thriller it is far from what you may expect from Hitchcock who instead focuses on creating a lighter, more pleasant and beautiful story filled with an enjoyable romance. That's not to say that the film does not have any elements of a usual Hitchcock thriller, after all the film is centred around uncovering the mystery that it the new 'Cat thief' and it's the mystery that makes for some great final scenes along the rooftops of Cannes. I highly recommend "To Catch a Thief", a film that are you are very much likely to enjoy. It's certainly not a Hitchcock classic that is spoke about in the same ilk as the likes of "Vertigo", "Psycho" and others but for what it is, it is a highly likable film that combines great acting, beautiful scenery and a highly enjoyable plot.

    I've just started watching this film on its new DVD format and it's a sight to behold indeed but the plot is the dumbest thing to come down the pike in years! To begin with, we are to believe that Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief, was in prison serving his term when the prison was bombed and he escaped only to join the resistance and become a hero in the process therefore absolving himself of all past crimes. Give me a break! And we are to believe this tripe? I'll watch the rest of it because I am a big Grace Kelly fan and she made so few films but whereas she looks absolutely breathtaking, Grant is way too tanned and almost looks African-American in some scenes. Why they didn't tone him down is something I will never understand. I'm giving it a 5 only because of Grace Kelly but between the absurd plot and Grant's absurd looks a 5 is the best I can do.

    This marked the first time I have seen a Cary Grant film. This is a remarkable confession for a movie guy like myself. The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch. Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a "low-class" thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past. As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7/10

    Seeing this described as light-weight Hitchcock was simply wrong. It has a light atmosphere and there are better Hitchcocks, but it is well-paced and is among the the most entertaining Hitchcock movies yet. First off: the landscapes of South-France! When the Tour de France is broadcast, it is as much a display of the cycling race as it as a clever marketing job with the most beautiful places of France convincingly filmed by the helicopter crews. Imagine a great director would take over and even further enhance this beauty. To Catch a Thief is just like that. It is a stunning display of the landscapes of South-France, with cars filmed from helicopters, terraces, marinas, skylines filmed from boats. Plot-wise, this is just that, a holiday trip. Nothing serious, but certainly entertaining, optimistic and beautiful. The cinematography here is the most beautiful yet in a Hitchcock movie. The landscapes, cities but also interiors look vivid, sharp yet natural. The costumed ball scene is a beautiful display of colours. The night scenes (with one clumsy obvious day-filmed scene) look mysterious in their green-blueish tint. Directing wise, with regards to composition of the shots, there are other Hitchcocks that are a little better (think Notorious, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Vertigo for example), but he's on fire here too. Compared with the cinematography this is a visual treat. Cary Grant is well-cast, strong here. Of the three movies Hitchcock did with Grace Kelly, this is her best performance. Kelly bursts out of the screen, sensual and eager, charismatic, but always elegant. It's no wonder she became a haunting memory to Hitchcock who was trying to recapture her looks in subsequent movies.

    Is To Catch a Thief among Hitchcock's best? No, in fact I don't even put it in my top 10. Did I expect it to? Again no, it is a very high expectation that can't be applied to every single film he's made(and just for the record as much as he is my favourite director I am not one who says he hasn't made a bad or disappointing film). All I wanted is a good entertaining film to watch, and To Catch a Thief fit that bill more than perfectly. There are times where the pacing, particularly in the middle, does get draggy. However, when so much is so good mostly that is ignorable and can only be noticed when the story gets thin on the ground, which admittedly it can do. Of all of Hitchcock's films, which are all wonderfully made(Jamaica Inn for me was one exception though), To Catch a Thief is one of Hitchcock's most audacious visually. The scenery is just breathtaking and only accentuated by the cinematography, deservedly Oscar-winning, that is both colourful and sweeping. Grace Kelly's wardrobe is glamour personified also. The music is energetic and beautifully orchestrated, fitting perfectly with the visuals and the film's tone. Hitchcock directs superbly, this is not a film that you associate him normally with(light romantic-comedy-thriller rather than suspense-thriller) but it is never jarring and has some of his trademark touches, unlike Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn I didn't have the feeling of this doesn't feel like Hitchcock. His cameo is worth looking out for too, as with all his other cameos in his films. The screenplay sparkles with wit and emotion, helping to at least keep us guessing until the last minute. The playful banter between Grant and Kelly and sexual innuendo are hugely entertaining. The story will entrance people and underwhelm others, while I can definitely understand the latter opinion and there were times where I felt it could have been tighter I was one of those who still found it interesting and involving thanks to the direction, cinematography and the leads' chemistry. There is the odd suspenseful touch, but there is more of an emphasis on the comedic and romantic elements, and both are done beautifully here with the comedy witty and playful and the romance sweet and touching. Cary Grant is very charming and urbane with a touch of arrogance, a side that you are familiar with with him but seeing as it's one that suits him to a tee you don't care. The gorgeous Grace Kelly I don't think has ever looked so beautiful and her droll yet understated performance is every bit as good as her performances in Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. The two have a sparkling chemistry which only adds to the enjoyment. Jessie Royce Landis is deliciously formidable and John Williams, a fine actor deserving of more praise even now, gives sterling support as well. Overall, well worth catching. It's not one of my favourites from Hitchcock and it's not one of his best, but at the same time it's not a film to be properly dismissed either. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to like about this Hitchcock movie, but it is one of the lesser lights in the great run of films he made from 1954 to 1964. The good stuff is obvious, a never-handsomer, suntanned Cary Grant at his easy-going best, Grace Kelly, a less capable actress and the unlikely pursuer of the diffident reformed cat-burglar John Robie character Grant plays, but looking very lovely indeed, some fine, indeed Oscar-winning cinematography from Robert Burks and some typically individual Hitchcock scenes, but there are drawbacks too. The story is slight, the action quite slow-moving, the background music overly-frivolous and intrusive, with too many scenes guilty of running on too long, even the car chase scene is uninvolving and ends dully. The denouement too, lacks suspense and in the end I found myself admiring the skills of the afore-mentioned Grant & Burks than really following the story, which definitely has a puffed-up feel to it. Amongst the memorable scenes Hitchcock delivers this time are the immediate juxtaposition of the robbery victim's scream after the travel-agency tour-type opening title sequence, Grant & Kelly's firework of a kiss and the celebrated "Mother comes too" final shot, but even these aren't in the vanguard of Hitch's very best work. Perhaps this tale of the idle rich didn't engage due to the fecklessness of the leads, but it seems to me having gone to France for the shoot, perhaps the great director got influenced too much by the sunny sky and pretty scenery, giving too much screen time to landscape shots and while the dialogue is occasionally racy, especially during Kelly's seduction of Grant, there's too much of it and too much of it which is superfluous to requirements. Nevertheless as an advertisement for the French Riviera, it does a good job, but as a mystery-thriller it probably doesn't quite make it.

    I really want to love this beautiful film. And it is beautiful. The sets, the colors, even at night, the lighting is just beautiful in every scene. The scenery of Southern France magnificent. The costumes, the gowns, the jewelry in it's sparkling splendor. But it simply isn't enough. I found myself daydreaming. It's dull. There is nothing interesting about the dialog, the script. It is supposed to be witty but it's flat. Some of the characters are supposed to be eccentric, they aren't. I had to fight to pay attention. I love Hitchcock, have seen almost all of his films but honestly, Cary Grant just is about as exciting as cardboard. All I can think of while watching him is, "was he gay?" Grace Kelly is always wonderful but even her part here feels bland. Sorry, just can't recommend this like I would Rear Window, Marnie, Vertigo. Just nothing fascinating here.

    To Catch A Thief is a brilliant classic movie with a terrific story line,a great cast and characters,and plenty of thrills,nothing you wouldn't expect from Alfred Hitchcock,one of the greatest directors of all time.Its definitely not his finest work,or even he scariest,but nothing he has done is bad,that is impossible,two of his main actors,Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,star in this,and this is Grace Kellys final film with Alfred Hitchcock,she will always be a great and very attractive actress,and I will always appreciate her work. John Robie (Cary Grant) is suspected of being the Jewel thief going around his town,but John hasn't robbed anything in fifteen years and must prove his innocence.
