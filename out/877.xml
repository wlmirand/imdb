    I'm in love with Alicia Silverstone, and though I'd like to get between her legs, this flick really stinks. The story, thin as it is, involves a girl who fakes her own kidnapping so her elusive father will pay more attention to her. If you think it gets any more complex than that, think again. For the next 100 minutes, Alicia engages in some throw-away banter with a car thief (Benicio del Toro), her drab uncle, and a couple of moronic henchmen. The final scene breeds claustrophobia and stupidity. Very weird-looking film; the kind of movie you should only see on an airplane that's about to crash or at a drive-in where the speakers don't work.

    A displeased pampered princess (Alicia Silverstone), whose crooked millionaire father (Jack Thompson) has problems arising with the Securities and Exchange Commission (taps on his phone by the authorities hoping he will give away details to put him in prison), stages a phony kidnapping just to get pops' attention (and hopefully his support; she later even envisions him personally removing her from the trunk with affection on his face and in voice to the media gathering about), but her car is stolen by a master thief (Benicio Del Toro), taken to his garage housing other confiscated vehicles. So it assumed Del Toro is the kidnapper and thanks to a feisty, uncooperative (and misbehaving) Silverstone, he loses control of the situation, the garage (thanks to a lit cigarette from Silverstone, hurled into a barrel with rags inside) sets afire with all the stolen, high-priced luxury vehicles going up in explosive flames as well. Del Toro was paid handsomely for the thefts and those who handed over the cash want it back because their cars went kaboom. If he could just get the money to them (Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen), perhaps Del Toro could still escape relatively unscathed, but then Silverstone's uncle enters the picture and complicates matters. That uncle is played (thankfully) by Christopher Walken and he "holds onto" the money in the duffle bag until Del Toro takes him to Silverstone as confirmation that she's okay. Then Turturro and Bowen realize that Silverstone could bring a hefty payday to them, so a real kidnapping will commence (Silverstone wasn't forthcoming to Del Toro, making her father think he had in fact took her hostage and "had her touch his penis"!), with Del Toro and Walken having to join forces to intervene. Personally, as much as I loved Silverstone in Clueless (1995) back in the day, I found her damn near insufferable in Excess Baggage. She reminded me of those spoiled brats needing to use shock methods to get Daddy Warbucks' attention. She is a difficult, pain-in-the-ass for Del Toro who just needs to deposit her some place and be done with her. But you wouldn't have a romantic comedy if it ended thirty minutes into the film with Del Toro and Silverstone parting ways (which, realistically, would have happened fifteen minutes in, but I digressÂ…). Walken, thank goodness, rescues us from a complete failure with his effortless command of the screen as the "fixer" who knows how to get things done for his brother. My favorite scene (well, all of Walken's scenes are worthwhile, but this one specifically made me smile) has Del Toro awakening to discover Walken hovering over him (inside a hideaway cabin of Del Toro's). I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it. Del Toro does his actor-studio shtick, using his hands and shrugging a lot, but he'd make up for this rather annoying performance later with great work in the likes of Traffic (2000), The Hunted (2003), 21 Grams (2003), and Savages (2012). He does convey obvious frustration which, considering what his character must tolerate thanks to Silverstone's immature antics, makes perfect sense. Consider this a waste of talent, with a nice rock soundtrack, and a Walken supporting part to treasure. Nothing more or less.

    "Emily" (played by Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, spoiled daughter of a corrupt millionaire named "Alexander" (Jack Thompson). She feels unloved and in this particular case, she is, as her father devotes more time and concern to his shady business than he does to her. So, in order to feel wanted, she devises her own kidnap scheme and after tying herself up gets into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately for her (and everyone else in this case), a car thief named "Vincent" (Benicio Del Toro) decides to steal the car not realizing she is in the trunk. Upon hearing a noise he opens it and that's when things really begin to go wrong for him. Now, while this may not be a side-splitting comedy, it does have some pretty funny moments. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the dim-witted thief who has to contend with a spoiled brat and finds out all too soon that she is more than he can handle. And while Alicia Silverstone may have been nominated for a "Razzie" for her performance, I didn't think she was that bad at all. Yes, there were a couple of weak spots here and there. But overall, I thought her acting was just fine for the part. Likewise, Christopher Walken performed in his usual high-level manner as "Ray", the bodyguard of Alexander, who probably understands Emily more than anyone. All things considered, I thought that this was a delightful movie deserving higher marks than some critics have given.

    A spoilt brat of a girl ('Emily' played by Alicia Silverstone) fakes her own kidnapping to spite her (very) wealthy father, but her plans to be found 'safe' locked in the trunk of her car go awry when an 'innocent' car thief ('Vincent' played by a charming Benicio Del Toro) steals the vehicle. There are several plot developments from this point forward involving a couple of heists, some dangerous small-time thugs looking for money owed to them, and a clumsy romance between Emily and Vincent. Chris Walken plays Emily's Uncle Ray, a savvy ex-military type who unravels the story behind the events more quickly than the hapless FBI agents. Walken is fabulous, and really connects the parts of the story, offering his own brand of menace (watch for a great scene where he tosses a giant redneck-type through a restaurant window), perhaps resembling a less-hostile, but relentless 1st generation Antone Chigurh (the Javier Bardem character from 'No Country for Old Men'). Remember though: this is a heist-gone-wrong-romantic-comedy -- so, things never get too 'dicey'. Also shining are Michael Bowen (popular TV actor) and Nicholas Turturro (of the famous Turturro family), particularly the latter. They portray the small-time hoods, trying to get into a larger game, but clearly out of their element. One of the beauties of these lower-budget 'heist' flicks can be the prospect of playing a great villain, and there are a few distinct opportunities in this film. (I wonder if those who rated the film poorly missed that). A parallel example of what I mean is John Lithgow in Sylvester Stallone's 'Cliffhanger', a film that had little going for it, other than Lithgow's brilliant villain mastermind. Walken and Tuturro almost carry Excess Baggage by themselves, but the leads (Silverstone and Del Torro) work a special chemistry themselves. Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    If truth be told, I appreciated Excess Baggage!!(now stare at the title!!!) I actually liked all of the characters and how emily hope ( alicia silverstone) and Vincent( Benicio Del Toro) were so appealing jointly. To me , they represented someone needing someone else, or Emily needing the love and support of Vincent. I could watch this movie everyday! Another thing i loved about this movie was how sweet it was!! Alicia plays a spoiled rich girl who never got the love she wanted from her busy father, and plus her father would rather attend a business meeting than even talk to her. how rude!! And then she meets vincent and at first she is scared but then they sort of have an understanding of each other. (Plus Benicio is really hot in this movie!!!)Vincent,in a way, takes care of emily and fills that empty spot in her heart. He would take care of her much better than her own father. Vincent can't stand that even her own father wouldn't give her the love that she needs.It was a really beautiful movie and also it was Alicia Silverstones Debut of producing! Another thing i thought was sweet was that Benicio and Alicia actually dated in real life during the making of this movie! How Sweet! Even though the movie got bad reviews, i really enjoyed it. Not only that, but it is clean enough to watch with younger kids in the room.To me, it seems like the perfect date movie or whenever you just feel like watching a movie. Another plus is that christopher walken is in the movie and he has made a lot of movies and he is well known. There were so many funny and sweet performances. Christopher plays uncle ray, Emily's uncle, and ever since she was born, he has looked out for her as if he was her father. He would protect her in anyway he could, even if that means killing vincent, the car thief, who could put her in jail. There was only one think that i can think of that was really weird and that was the preview, i had never actually watched it before, but it didn't really showcase the movie for what it was! i would have done it completely different, but otherwise the movie was sooooooo great!!!!(plus there were a lot of nice cars)

    I sure did enjoy the review by Luvmymom and many other reviews here. I saw the 51% rating at the header and I am sad for the 49% that found no joy here. My Mom was - is - the finest, most Motherly human being on Planet Earth, possibly the entire Universe. A beautiful and proud Italian Gal, but more to the point a Human Gal - Mom and Dad were colorblind as to race and never locked our front door - "What if one of our friends or neighbors has an emergency and needs our phone or something?" - that was the basic way of life at our various San Fran and Brisbane households. Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Emily Hope is a mess. She has an unresolved issue with a cold father that has not shown her any warmth throughout her young life. That is why she devises a plan to get even with the old man by staging her own kidnap in exchange for one million dollars ransom. Alexander Hope, the father, decides to go along in paying the ransom. Neither Emily nor Alexander are prepared for what happens next. The supposedly kidnapped girl decided to hide in the trunk of her fancy BMW parked at a car park, where she was to have been found. Vincent, a young criminal, steals the car for a client, not realizing there is a woman in the trunk. Vincent gets much more than what he bargained for, as he gets stuck with Emily, something that never entered in his plans. This 1997 Columbia Pictures release was a vehicle for Alicia Silverstone, the young actress that made a success out of her first big role in "Clueless". She was one of the producers of the film with her newly formed company. Unfortunately, the star cast herself against an actor that stole the picture from under her. It is Benicio Del Toro who is the real star of the film. Perhaps with another team, "Excess Baggage" might have turned out differently, but as directed by Marco Brambilla, it does not go anywhere. Based on a story by Max Adams, the material adaptation for the screen is too predictable and it is a waste Christopher Walken's talent, who has a small part.

    When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied. Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P ) All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief. Fans of the "Clueless" starlet may find "Excess Baggage" a puzzling departure for Silverstone who wielded ultimate creative authority over both script and casting. Perhaps she is more to blame for the muddled quality of "Excess Baggage" than either Brambilla or the writers. Never as entertaining as "Clueless" but better than "Batman & Robin," "Excess Baggage" arrives as something of a letdown after Silverstone's long screen absence. Cast as Emily T. Hope, the moody daughter of a man richer than Donald Trump, Silverstone constantly struggles to elicit her icy hearted, corporate father's affections. Australian actor Jack ("'Breaker' Morant") Thompson plays the father who has grown weary of his daughter's outlandish schemes to attract his attention. When he sent her away to a boarding school, Emily torched the place. As "Excess Baggage" unfolds, she has convinced not only her father but also the FBI that kidnappers are holding her for a million dollar ransom. Lamely, Emily hopes that her rescue from her bogus kidnappers will rekindle her papa's love. So she gags, tapes and cuffs herself before she jumps into the trunk (not a stunt you should try) of her BMW. Just as it looks as if everything is going Emily's way, a car thief spots her Beamer in a parking garage and steals it as she lies helpless in the trunk. No sooner does Vincent (Benicio Del Toro) wheel his latest trophy onto the street than a swarm of police cars descends on him. A tire-screeching chase ensues, and Vincent manages to shake his pursuers. He pulls into a nondescript warehouse that conceals his stolen vehicles. Vincent is an expert car thief who boosts expensive sports cars. When he puts the car on the rack, he notices that it wobbles. Imagine his shock when he finds a babe chick inside bound and gagged. Vincent slams the trunk! Since he cannot think of anything else, he calls his partner-in-crime Greg (Harry Connick, Jr), a car salesman. Meanwhile, Emily's suspicious father calls in his right hand man, Uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) to find his daughter. After Emily breaks out of the car, she calls pop, but hangs up when Vincent returns. Eventually, Vincent decides to leave her on foot far out in the forest. That's when he discovers her identity and that his car warehouse stands in a pile of smoking ashes. Now, the guys who paid Vincent to steal the cars (Nicholas Turturro & Michael Bowen) want their $200-thousand dollars back. Spotting Emily, they pull guns on Vincent and take Emily hostage with a million dollar ransom demand. It seems that "Excess Baggage" is a series of kidnappings and abductions. The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

    Okay, so people might think I'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one. But I was sitting here the other night, we just moved into a new house. I love the new environment, and I was ready for the new year. I was up late, as always, and this movie came on TBS. I had just watched Clueless with Alicia in, and I thought if I could stay awake long enough, I would watch this. I love Walken and Silverstone, but had never seen Toro in much. So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didn't matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said "you don't have to be drunk to kiss me"...and he said "I'm not drunk"...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever he's talking to her dad, and he says, "Are you telling me I've only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do?" Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And they're sitting there in the trunk and he says "what a view"..she says "What makes it a view?" he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think that's clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You won't hate it then!

    "Emily" (played by Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, spoiled daughter of a corrupt millionaire named "Alexander" (Jack Thompson). She feels unloved and in this particular case, she is, as her father devotes more time and concern to his shady business than he does to her. So, in order to feel wanted, she devises her own kidnap scheme and after tying herself up gets into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately for her (and everyone else in this case), a car thief named "Vincent" (Benicio Del Toro) decides to steal the car not realizing she is in the trunk. Upon hearing a noise he opens it and that's when things really begin to go wrong for him. Now, while this may not be a side-splitting comedy, it does have some pretty funny moments. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the dim-witted thief who has to contend with a spoiled brat and finds out all too soon that she is more than he can handle. And while Alicia Silverstone may have been nominated for a "Razzie" for her performance, I didn't think she was that bad at all. Yes, there were a couple of weak spots here and there. But overall, I thought her acting was just fine for the part. Likewise, Christopher Walken performed in his usual high-level manner as "Ray", the bodyguard of Alexander, who probably understands Emily more than anyone. All things considered, I thought that this was a delightful movie deserving higher marks than some critics have given.

    A spoilt brat of a girl ('Emily' played by Alicia Silverstone) fakes her own kidnapping to spite her (very) wealthy father, but her plans to be found 'safe' locked in the trunk of her car go awry when an 'innocent' car thief ('Vincent' played by a charming Benicio Del Toro) steals the vehicle. There are several plot developments from this point forward involving a couple of heists, some dangerous small-time thugs looking for money owed to them, and a clumsy romance between Emily and Vincent. Chris Walken plays Emily's Uncle Ray, a savvy ex-military type who unravels the story behind the events more quickly than the hapless FBI agents. Walken is fabulous, and really connects the parts of the story, offering his own brand of menace (watch for a great scene where he tosses a giant redneck-type through a restaurant window), perhaps resembling a less-hostile, but relentless 1st generation Antone Chigurh (the Javier Bardem character from 'No Country for Old Men'). Remember though: this is a heist-gone-wrong-romantic-comedy -- so, things never get too 'dicey'. Also shining are Michael Bowen (popular TV actor) and Nicholas Turturro (of the famous Turturro family), particularly the latter. They portray the small-time hoods, trying to get into a larger game, but clearly out of their element. One of the beauties of these lower-budget 'heist' flicks can be the prospect of playing a great villain, and there are a few distinct opportunities in this film. (I wonder if those who rated the film poorly missed that). A parallel example of what I mean is John Lithgow in Sylvester Stallone's 'Cliffhanger', a film that had little going for it, other than Lithgow's brilliant villain mastermind. Walken and Tuturro almost carry Excess Baggage by themselves, but the leads (Silverstone and Del Torro) work a special chemistry themselves. Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    If truth be told, I appreciated Excess Baggage!!(now stare at the title!!!) I actually liked all of the characters and how emily hope ( alicia silverstone) and Vincent( Benicio Del Toro) were so appealing jointly. To me , they represented someone needing someone else, or Emily needing the love and support of Vincent. I could watch this movie everyday! Another thing i loved about this movie was how sweet it was!! Alicia plays a spoiled rich girl who never got the love she wanted from her busy father, and plus her father would rather attend a business meeting than even talk to her. how rude!! And then she meets vincent and at first she is scared but then they sort of have an understanding of each other. (Plus Benicio is really hot in this movie!!!)Vincent,in a way, takes care of emily and fills that empty spot in her heart. He would take care of her much better than her own father. Vincent can't stand that even her own father wouldn't give her the love that she needs.It was a really beautiful movie and also it was Alicia Silverstones Debut of producing! Another thing i thought was sweet was that Benicio and Alicia actually dated in real life during the making of this movie! How Sweet! Even though the movie got bad reviews, i really enjoyed it. Not only that, but it is clean enough to watch with younger kids in the room.To me, it seems like the perfect date movie or whenever you just feel like watching a movie. Another plus is that christopher walken is in the movie and he has made a lot of movies and he is well known. There were so many funny and sweet performances. Christopher plays uncle ray, Emily's uncle, and ever since she was born, he has looked out for her as if he was her father. He would protect her in anyway he could, even if that means killing vincent, the car thief, who could put her in jail. There was only one think that i can think of that was really weird and that was the preview, i had never actually watched it before, but it didn't really showcase the movie for what it was! i would have done it completely different, but otherwise the movie was sooooooo great!!!!(plus there were a lot of nice cars)

    I sure did enjoy the review by Luvmymom and many other reviews here. I saw the 51% rating at the header and I am sad for the 49% that found no joy here. My Mom was - is - the finest, most Motherly human being on Planet Earth, possibly the entire Universe. A beautiful and proud Italian Gal, but more to the point a Human Gal - Mom and Dad were colorblind as to race and never locked our front door - "What if one of our friends or neighbors has an emergency and needs our phone or something?" - that was the basic way of life at our various San Fran and Brisbane households. Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Emily Hope is a mess. She has an unresolved issue with a cold father that has not shown her any warmth throughout her young life. That is why she devises a plan to get even with the old man by staging her own kidnap in exchange for one million dollars ransom. Alexander Hope, the father, decides to go along in paying the ransom. Neither Emily nor Alexander are prepared for what happens next. The supposedly kidnapped girl decided to hide in the trunk of her fancy BMW parked at a car park, where she was to have been found. Vincent, a young criminal, steals the car for a client, not realizing there is a woman in the trunk. Vincent gets much more than what he bargained for, as he gets stuck with Emily, something that never entered in his plans. This 1997 Columbia Pictures release was a vehicle for Alicia Silverstone, the young actress that made a success out of her first big role in "Clueless". She was one of the producers of the film with her newly formed company. Unfortunately, the star cast herself against an actor that stole the picture from under her. It is Benicio Del Toro who is the real star of the film. Perhaps with another team, "Excess Baggage" might have turned out differently, but as directed by Marco Brambilla, it does not go anywhere. Based on a story by Max Adams, the material adaptation for the screen is too predictable and it is a waste Christopher Walken's talent, who has a small part.

    When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied. Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P ) All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief. Fans of the "Clueless" starlet may find "Excess Baggage" a puzzling departure for Silverstone who wielded ultimate creative authority over both script and casting. Perhaps she is more to blame for the muddled quality of "Excess Baggage" than either Brambilla or the writers. Never as entertaining as "Clueless" but better than "Batman & Robin," "Excess Baggage" arrives as something of a letdown after Silverstone's long screen absence. Cast as Emily T. Hope, the moody daughter of a man richer than Donald Trump, Silverstone constantly struggles to elicit her icy hearted, corporate father's affections. Australian actor Jack ("'Breaker' Morant") Thompson plays the father who has grown weary of his daughter's outlandish schemes to attract his attention. When he sent her away to a boarding school, Emily torched the place. As "Excess Baggage" unfolds, she has convinced not only her father but also the FBI that kidnappers are holding her for a million dollar ransom. Lamely, Emily hopes that her rescue from her bogus kidnappers will rekindle her papa's love. So she gags, tapes and cuffs herself before she jumps into the trunk (not a stunt you should try) of her BMW. Just as it looks as if everything is going Emily's way, a car thief spots her Beamer in a parking garage and steals it as she lies helpless in the trunk. No sooner does Vincent (Benicio Del Toro) wheel his latest trophy onto the street than a swarm of police cars descends on him. A tire-screeching chase ensues, and Vincent manages to shake his pursuers. He pulls into a nondescript warehouse that conceals his stolen vehicles. Vincent is an expert car thief who boosts expensive sports cars. When he puts the car on the rack, he notices that it wobbles. Imagine his shock when he finds a babe chick inside bound and gagged. Vincent slams the trunk! Since he cannot think of anything else, he calls his partner-in-crime Greg (Harry Connick, Jr), a car salesman. Meanwhile, Emily's suspicious father calls in his right hand man, Uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) to find his daughter. After Emily breaks out of the car, she calls pop, but hangs up when Vincent returns. Eventually, Vincent decides to leave her on foot far out in the forest. That's when he discovers her identity and that his car warehouse stands in a pile of smoking ashes. Now, the guys who paid Vincent to steal the cars (Nicholas Turturro & Michael Bowen) want their $200-thousand dollars back. Spotting Emily, they pull guns on Vincent and take Emily hostage with a million dollar ransom demand. It seems that "Excess Baggage" is a series of kidnappings and abductions. The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

    Okay, so people might think I'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one. But I was sitting here the other night, we just moved into a new house. I love the new environment, and I was ready for the new year. I was up late, as always, and this movie came on TBS. I had just watched Clueless with Alicia in, and I thought if I could stay awake long enough, I would watch this. I love Walken and Silverstone, but had never seen Toro in much. So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didn't matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said "you don't have to be drunk to kiss me"...and he said "I'm not drunk"...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever he's talking to her dad, and he says, "Are you telling me I've only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do?" Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And they're sitting there in the trunk and he says "what a view"..she says "What makes it a view?" he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think that's clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You won't hate it then!

    I'm in love with Alicia Silverstone, and though I'd like to get between her legs, this flick really stinks. The story, thin as it is, involves a girl who fakes her own kidnapping so her elusive father will pay more attention to her. If you think it gets any more complex than that, think again. For the next 100 minutes, Alicia engages in some throw-away banter with a car thief (Benicio del Toro), her drab uncle, and a couple of moronic henchmen. The final scene breeds claustrophobia and stupidity. Very weird-looking film; the kind of movie you should only see on an airplane that's about to crash or at a drive-in where the speakers don't work.

    A displeased pampered princess (Alicia Silverstone), whose crooked millionaire father (Jack Thompson) has problems arising with the Securities and Exchange Commission (taps on his phone by the authorities hoping he will give away details to put him in prison), stages a phony kidnapping just to get pops' attention (and hopefully his support; she later even envisions him personally removing her from the trunk with affection on his face and in voice to the media gathering about), but her car is stolen by a master thief (Benicio Del Toro), taken to his garage housing other confiscated vehicles. So it assumed Del Toro is the kidnapper and thanks to a feisty, uncooperative (and misbehaving) Silverstone, he loses control of the situation, the garage (thanks to a lit cigarette from Silverstone, hurled into a barrel with rags inside) sets afire with all the stolen, high-priced luxury vehicles going up in explosive flames as well. Del Toro was paid handsomely for the thefts and those who handed over the cash want it back because their cars went kaboom. If he could just get the money to them (Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen), perhaps Del Toro could still escape relatively unscathed, but then Silverstone's uncle enters the picture and complicates matters. That uncle is played (thankfully) by Christopher Walken and he "holds onto" the money in the duffle bag until Del Toro takes him to Silverstone as confirmation that she's okay. Then Turturro and Bowen realize that Silverstone could bring a hefty payday to them, so a real kidnapping will commence (Silverstone wasn't forthcoming to Del Toro, making her father think he had in fact took her hostage and "had her touch his penis"!), with Del Toro and Walken having to join forces to intervene. Personally, as much as I loved Silverstone in Clueless (1995) back in the day, I found her damn near insufferable in Excess Baggage. She reminded me of those spoiled brats needing to use shock methods to get Daddy Warbucks' attention. She is a difficult, pain-in-the-ass for Del Toro who just needs to deposit her some place and be done with her. But you wouldn't have a romantic comedy if it ended thirty minutes into the film with Del Toro and Silverstone parting ways (which, realistically, would have happened fifteen minutes in, but I digressÂ…). Walken, thank goodness, rescues us from a complete failure with his effortless command of the screen as the "fixer" who knows how to get things done for his brother. My favorite scene (well, all of Walken's scenes are worthwhile, but this one specifically made me smile) has Del Toro awakening to discover Walken hovering over him (inside a hideaway cabin of Del Toro's). I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it. Del Toro does his actor-studio shtick, using his hands and shrugging a lot, but he'd make up for this rather annoying performance later with great work in the likes of Traffic (2000), The Hunted (2003), 21 Grams (2003), and Savages (2012). He does convey obvious frustration which, considering what his character must tolerate thanks to Silverstone's immature antics, makes perfect sense. Consider this a waste of talent, with a nice rock soundtrack, and a Walken supporting part to treasure. Nothing more or less.

Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Emily Hope is a mess. She has an unresolved issue with a cold father that has not shown her any warmth throughout her young life. That is why she devises a plan to get even with the old man by staging her own kidnap in exchange for one million dollars ransom. Alexander Hope, the father, decides to go along in paying the ransom. Neither Emily nor Alexander are prepared for what happens next. The supposedly kidnapped girl decided to hide in the trunk of her fancy BMW parked at a car park, where she was to have been found. Vincent, a young criminal, steals the car for a client, not realizing there is a woman in the trunk. Vincent gets much more than what he bargained for, as he gets stuck with Emily, something that never entered in his plans. This 1997 Columbia Pictures release was a vehicle for Alicia Silverstone, the young actress that made a success out of her first big role in "Clueless". She was one of the producers of the film with her newly formed company. Unfortunately, the star cast herself against an actor that stole the picture from under her. It is Benicio Del Toro who is the real star of the film. Perhaps with another team, "Excess Baggage" might have turned out differently, but as directed by Marco Brambilla, it does not go anywhere. Based on a story by Max Adams, the material adaptation for the screen is too predictable and it is a waste Christopher Walken's talent, who has a small part.

    When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied. Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P ) All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief. Fans of the "Clueless" starlet may find "Excess Baggage" a puzzling departure for Silverstone who wielded ultimate creative authority over both script and casting. Perhaps she is more to blame for the muddled quality of "Excess Baggage" than either Brambilla or the writers. Never as entertaining as "Clueless" but better than "Batman & Robin," "Excess Baggage" arrives as something of a letdown after Silverstone's long screen absence. Cast as Emily T. Hope, the moody daughter of a man richer than Donald Trump, Silverstone constantly struggles to elicit her icy hearted, corporate father's affections. Australian actor Jack ("'Breaker' Morant") Thompson plays the father who has grown weary of his daughter's outlandish schemes to attract his attention. When he sent her away to a boarding school, Emily torched the place. As "Excess Baggage" unfolds, she has convinced not only her father but also the FBI that kidnappers are holding her for a million dollar ransom. Lamely, Emily hopes that her rescue from her bogus kidnappers will rekindle her papa's love. So she gags, tapes and cuffs herself before she jumps into the trunk (not a stunt you should try) of her BMW. Just as it looks as if everything is going Emily's way, a car thief spots her Beamer in a parking garage and steals it as she lies helpless in the trunk. No sooner does Vincent (Benicio Del Toro) wheel his latest trophy onto the street than a swarm of police cars descends on him. A tire-screeching chase ensues, and Vincent manages to shake his pursuers. He pulls into a nondescript warehouse that conceals his stolen vehicles. Vincent is an expert car thief who boosts expensive sports cars. When he puts the car on the rack, he notices that it wobbles. Imagine his shock when he finds a babe chick inside bound and gagged. Vincent slams the trunk! Since he cannot think of anything else, he calls his partner-in-crime Greg (Harry Connick, Jr), a car salesman. Meanwhile, Emily's suspicious father calls in his right hand man, Uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) to find his daughter. After Emily breaks out of the car, she calls pop, but hangs up when Vincent returns. Eventually, Vincent decides to leave her on foot far out in the forest. That's when he discovers her identity and that his car warehouse stands in a pile of smoking ashes. Now, the guys who paid Vincent to steal the cars (Nicholas Turturro & Michael Bowen) want their $200-thousand dollars back. Spotting Emily, they pull guns on Vincent and take Emily hostage with a million dollar ransom demand. It seems that "Excess Baggage" is a series of kidnappings and abductions. The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

    Okay, so people might think I'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one. But I was sitting here the other night, we just moved into a new house. I love the new environment, and I was ready for the new year. I was up late, as always, and this movie came on TBS. I had just watched Clueless with Alicia in, and I thought if I could stay awake long enough, I would watch this. I love Walken and Silverstone, but had never seen Toro in much. So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didn't matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said "you don't have to be drunk to kiss me"...and he said "I'm not drunk"...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever he's talking to her dad, and he says, "Are you telling me I've only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do?" Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And they're sitting there in the trunk and he says "what a view"..she says "What makes it a view?" he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think that's clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You won't hate it then!

    I'm in love with Alicia Silverstone, and though I'd like to get between her legs, this flick really stinks. The story, thin as it is, involves a girl who fakes her own kidnapping so her elusive father will pay more attention to her. If you think it gets any more complex than that, think again. For the next 100 minutes, Alicia engages in some throw-away banter with a car thief (Benicio del Toro), her drab uncle, and a couple of moronic henchmen. The final scene breeds claustrophobia and stupidity. Very weird-looking film; the kind of movie you should only see on an airplane that's about to crash or at a drive-in where the speakers don't work.

    A displeased pampered princess (Alicia Silverstone), whose crooked millionaire father (Jack Thompson) has problems arising with the Securities and Exchange Commission (taps on his phone by the authorities hoping he will give away details to put him in prison), stages a phony kidnapping just to get pops' attention (and hopefully his support; she later even envisions him personally removing her from the trunk with affection on his face and in voice to the media gathering about), but her car is stolen by a master thief (Benicio Del Toro), taken to his garage housing other confiscated vehicles. So it assumed Del Toro is the kidnapper and thanks to a feisty, uncooperative (and misbehaving) Silverstone, he loses control of the situation, the garage (thanks to a lit cigarette from Silverstone, hurled into a barrel with rags inside) sets afire with all the stolen, high-priced luxury vehicles going up in explosive flames as well. Del Toro was paid handsomely for the thefts and those who handed over the cash want it back because their cars went kaboom. If he could just get the money to them (Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen), perhaps Del Toro could still escape relatively unscathed, but then Silverstone's uncle enters the picture and complicates matters. That uncle is played (thankfully) by Christopher Walken and he "holds onto" the money in the duffle bag until Del Toro takes him to Silverstone as confirmation that she's okay. Then Turturro and Bowen realize that Silverstone could bring a hefty payday to them, so a real kidnapping will commence (Silverstone wasn't forthcoming to Del Toro, making her father think he had in fact took her hostage and "had her touch his penis"!), with Del Toro and Walken having to join forces to intervene. Personally, as much as I loved Silverstone in Clueless (1995) back in the day, I found her damn near insufferable in Excess Baggage. She reminded me of those spoiled brats needing to use shock methods to get Daddy Warbucks' attention. She is a difficult, pain-in-the-ass for Del Toro who just needs to deposit her some place and be done with her. But you wouldn't have a romantic comedy if it ended thirty minutes into the film with Del Toro and Silverstone parting ways (which, realistically, would have happened fifteen minutes in, but I digressÂ…). Walken, thank goodness, rescues us from a complete failure with his effortless command of the screen as the "fixer" who knows how to get things done for his brother. My favorite scene (well, all of Walken's scenes are worthwhile, but this one specifically made me smile) has Del Toro awakening to discover Walken hovering over him (inside a hideaway cabin of Del Toro's). I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it. Del Toro does his actor-studio shtick, using his hands and shrugging a lot, but he'd make up for this rather annoying performance later with great work in the likes of Traffic (2000), The Hunted (2003), 21 Grams (2003), and Savages (2012). He does convey obvious frustration which, considering what his character must tolerate thanks to Silverstone's immature antics, makes perfect sense. Consider this a waste of talent, with a nice rock soundtrack, and a Walken supporting part to treasure. Nothing more or less.

    "Emily" (played by Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, spoiled daughter of a corrupt millionaire named "Alexander" (Jack Thompson). She feels unloved and in this particular case, she is, as her father devotes more time and concern to his shady business than he does to her. So, in order to feel wanted, she devises her own kidnap scheme and after tying herself up gets into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately for her (and everyone else in this case), a car thief named "Vincent" (Benicio Del Toro) decides to steal the car not realizing she is in the trunk. Upon hearing a noise he opens it and that's when things really begin to go wrong for him. Now, while this may not be a side-splitting comedy, it does have some pretty funny moments. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the dim-witted thief who has to contend with a spoiled brat and finds out all too soon that she is more than he can handle. And while Alicia Silverstone may have been nominated for a "Razzie" for her performance, I didn't think she was that bad at all. Yes, there were a couple of weak spots here and there. But overall, I thought her acting was just fine for the part. Likewise, Christopher Walken performed in his usual high-level manner as "Ray", the bodyguard of Alexander, who probably understands Emily more than anyone. All things considered, I thought that this was a delightful movie deserving higher marks than some critics have given.

    A spoilt brat of a girl ('Emily' played by Alicia Silverstone) fakes her own kidnapping to spite her (very) wealthy father, but her plans to be found 'safe' locked in the trunk of her car go awry when an 'innocent' car thief ('Vincent' played by a charming Benicio Del Toro) steals the vehicle. There are several plot developments from this point forward involving a couple of heists, some dangerous small-time thugs looking for money owed to them, and a clumsy romance between Emily and Vincent. Chris Walken plays Emily's Uncle Ray, a savvy ex-military type who unravels the story behind the events more quickly than the hapless FBI agents. Walken is fabulous, and really connects the parts of the story, offering his own brand of menace (watch for a great scene where he tosses a giant redneck-type through a restaurant window), perhaps resembling a less-hostile, but relentless 1st generation Antone Chigurh (the Javier Bardem character from 'No Country for Old Men'). Remember though: this is a heist-gone-wrong-romantic-comedy -- so, things never get too 'dicey'. Also shining are Michael Bowen (popular TV actor) and Nicholas Turturro (of the famous Turturro family), particularly the latter. They portray the small-time hoods, trying to get into a larger game, but clearly out of their element. One of the beauties of these lower-budget 'heist' flicks can be the prospect of playing a great villain, and there are a few distinct opportunities in this film. (I wonder if those who rated the film poorly missed that). A parallel example of what I mean is John Lithgow in Sylvester Stallone's 'Cliffhanger', a film that had little going for it, other than Lithgow's brilliant villain mastermind. Walken and Tuturro almost carry Excess Baggage by themselves, but the leads (Silverstone and Del Torro) work a special chemistry themselves. Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    If truth be told, I appreciated Excess Baggage!!(now stare at the title!!!) I actually liked all of the characters and how emily hope ( alicia silverstone) and Vincent( Benicio Del Toro) were so appealing jointly. To me , they represented someone needing someone else, or Emily needing the love and support of Vincent. I could watch this movie everyday! Another thing i loved about this movie was how sweet it was!! Alicia plays a spoiled rich girl who never got the love she wanted from her busy father, and plus her father would rather attend a business meeting than even talk to her. how rude!! And then she meets vincent and at first she is scared but then they sort of have an understanding of each other. (Plus Benicio is really hot in this movie!!!)Vincent,in a way, takes care of emily and fills that empty spot in her heart. He would take care of her much better than her own father. Vincent can't stand that even her own father wouldn't give her the love that she needs.It was a really beautiful movie and also it was Alicia Silverstones Debut of producing! Another thing i thought was sweet was that Benicio and Alicia actually dated in real life during the making of this movie! How Sweet! Even though the movie got bad reviews, i really enjoyed it. Not only that, but it is clean enough to watch with younger kids in the room.To me, it seems like the perfect date movie or whenever you just feel like watching a movie. Another plus is that christopher walken is in the movie and he has made a lot of movies and he is well known. There were so many funny and sweet performances. Christopher plays uncle ray, Emily's uncle, and ever since she was born, he has looked out for her as if he was her father. He would protect her in anyway he could, even if that means killing vincent, the car thief, who could put her in jail. There was only one think that i can think of that was really weird and that was the preview, i had never actually watched it before, but it didn't really showcase the movie for what it was! i would have done it completely different, but otherwise the movie was sooooooo great!!!!(plus there were a lot of nice cars)

    I sure did enjoy the review by Luvmymom and many other reviews here. I saw the 51% rating at the header and I am sad for the 49% that found no joy here. My Mom was - is - the finest, most Motherly human being on Planet Earth, possibly the entire Universe. A beautiful and proud Italian Gal, but more to the point a Human Gal - Mom and Dad were colorblind as to race and never locked our front door - "What if one of our friends or neighbors has an emergency and needs our phone or something?" - that was the basic way of life at our various San Fran and Brisbane households. Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief.

The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

    Okay, so people might think I'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one. But I was sitting here the other night, we just moved into a new house. I love the new environment, and I was ready for the new year. I was up late, as always, and this movie came on TBS. I had just watched Clueless with Alicia in, and I thought if I could stay awake long enough, I would watch this. I love Walken and Silverstone, but had never seen Toro in much. So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didn't matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said "you don't have to be drunk to kiss me"...and he said "I'm not drunk"...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever he's talking to her dad, and he says, "Are you telling me I've only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do?" Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And they're sitting there in the trunk and he says "what a view"..she says "What makes it a view?" he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think that's clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You won't hate it then!

    I'm in love with Alicia Silverstone, and though I'd like to get between her legs, this flick really stinks. The story, thin as it is, involves a girl who fakes her own kidnapping so her elusive father will pay more attention to her. If you think it gets any more complex than that, think again. For the next 100 minutes, Alicia engages in some throw-away banter with a car thief (Benicio del Toro), her drab uncle, and a couple of moronic henchmen. The final scene breeds claustrophobia and stupidity. Very weird-looking film; the kind of movie you should only see on an airplane that's about to crash or at a drive-in where the speakers don't work.

    A displeased pampered princess (Alicia Silverstone), whose crooked millionaire father (Jack Thompson) has problems arising with the Securities and Exchange Commission (taps on his phone by the authorities hoping he will give away details to put him in prison), stages a phony kidnapping just to get pops' attention (and hopefully his support; she later even envisions him personally removing her from the trunk with affection on his face and in voice to the media gathering about), but her car is stolen by a master thief (Benicio Del Toro), taken to his garage housing other confiscated vehicles. So it assumed Del Toro is the kidnapper and thanks to a feisty, uncooperative (and misbehaving) Silverstone, he loses control of the situation, the garage (thanks to a lit cigarette from Silverstone, hurled into a barrel with rags inside) sets afire with all the stolen, high-priced luxury vehicles going up in explosive flames as well. Del Toro was paid handsomely for the thefts and those who handed over the cash want it back because their cars went kaboom. If he could just get the money to them (Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen), perhaps Del Toro could still escape relatively unscathed, but then Silverstone's uncle enters the picture and complicates matters. That uncle is played (thankfully) by Christopher Walken and he "holds onto" the money in the duffle bag until Del Toro takes him to Silverstone as confirmation that she's okay. Then Turturro and Bowen realize that Silverstone could bring a hefty payday to them, so a real kidnapping will commence (Silverstone wasn't forthcoming to Del Toro, making her father think he had in fact took her hostage and "had her touch his penis"!), with Del Toro and Walken having to join forces to intervene. Personally, as much as I loved Silverstone in Clueless (1995) back in the day, I found her damn near insufferable in Excess Baggage. She reminded me of those spoiled brats needing to use shock methods to get Daddy Warbucks' attention. She is a difficult, pain-in-the-ass for Del Toro who just needs to deposit her some place and be done with her. But you wouldn't have a romantic comedy if it ended thirty minutes into the film with Del Toro and Silverstone parting ways (which, realistically, would have happened fifteen minutes in, but I digressÂ…). Walken, thank goodness, rescues us from a complete failure with his effortless command of the screen as the "fixer" who knows how to get things done for his brother. My favorite scene (well, all of Walken's scenes are worthwhile, but this one specifically made me smile) has Del Toro awakening to discover Walken hovering over him (inside a hideaway cabin of Del Toro's). I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it. Del Toro does his actor-studio shtick, using his hands and shrugging a lot, but he'd make up for this rather annoying performance later with great work in the likes of Traffic (2000), The Hunted (2003), 21 Grams (2003), and Savages (2012). He does convey obvious frustration which, considering what his character must tolerate thanks to Silverstone's immature antics, makes perfect sense. Consider this a waste of talent, with a nice rock soundtrack, and a Walken supporting part to treasure. Nothing more or less.

    "Emily" (played by Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, spoiled daughter of a corrupt millionaire named "Alexander" (Jack Thompson). She feels unloved and in this particular case, she is, as her father devotes more time and concern to his shady business than he does to her. So, in order to feel wanted, she devises her own kidnap scheme and after tying herself up gets into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately for her (and everyone else in this case), a car thief named "Vincent" (Benicio Del Toro) decides to steal the car not realizing she is in the trunk. Upon hearing a noise he opens it and that's when things really begin to go wrong for him. Now, while this may not be a side-splitting comedy, it does have some pretty funny moments. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the dim-witted thief who has to contend with a spoiled brat and finds out all too soon that she is more than he can handle. And while Alicia Silverstone may have been nominated for a "Razzie" for her performance, I didn't think she was that bad at all. Yes, there were a couple of weak spots here and there. But overall, I thought her acting was just fine for the part. Likewise, Christopher Walken performed in his usual high-level manner as "Ray", the bodyguard of Alexander, who probably understands Emily more than anyone. All things considered, I thought that this was a delightful movie deserving higher marks than some critics have given.

    A spoilt brat of a girl ('Emily' played by Alicia Silverstone) fakes her own kidnapping to spite her (very) wealthy father, but her plans to be found 'safe' locked in the trunk of her car go awry when an 'innocent' car thief ('Vincent' played by a charming Benicio Del Toro) steals the vehicle. There are several plot developments from this point forward involving a couple of heists, some dangerous small-time thugs looking for money owed to them, and a clumsy romance between Emily and Vincent. Chris Walken plays Emily's Uncle Ray, a savvy ex-military type who unravels the story behind the events more quickly than the hapless FBI agents. Walken is fabulous, and really connects the parts of the story, offering his own brand of menace (watch for a great scene where he tosses a giant redneck-type through a restaurant window), perhaps resembling a less-hostile, but relentless 1st generation Antone Chigurh (the Javier Bardem character from 'No Country for Old Men'). Remember though: this is a heist-gone-wrong-romantic-comedy -- so, things never get too 'dicey'. Also shining are Michael Bowen (popular TV actor) and Nicholas Turturro (of the famous Turturro family), particularly the latter. They portray the small-time hoods, trying to get into a larger game, but clearly out of their element. One of the beauties of these lower-budget 'heist' flicks can be the prospect of playing a great villain, and there are a few distinct opportunities in this film. (I wonder if those who rated the film poorly missed that). A parallel example of what I mean is John Lithgow in Sylvester Stallone's 'Cliffhanger', a film that had little going for it, other than Lithgow's brilliant villain mastermind. Walken and Tuturro almost carry Excess Baggage by themselves, but the leads (Silverstone and Del Torro) work a special chemistry themselves. Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    If truth be told, I appreciated Excess Baggage!!(now stare at the title!!!) I actually liked all of the characters and how emily hope ( alicia silverstone) and Vincent( Benicio Del Toro) were so appealing jointly. To me , they represented someone needing someone else, or Emily needing the love and support of Vincent. I could watch this movie everyday! Another thing i loved about this movie was how sweet it was!! Alicia plays a spoiled rich girl who never got the love she wanted from her busy father, and plus her father would rather attend a business meeting than even talk to her. how rude!! And then she meets vincent and at first she is scared but then they sort of have an understanding of each other. (Plus Benicio is really hot in this movie!!!)Vincent,in a way, takes care of emily and fills that empty spot in her heart. He would take care of her much better than her own father. Vincent can't stand that even her own father wouldn't give her the love that she needs.It was a really beautiful movie and also it was Alicia Silverstones Debut of producing! Another thing i thought was sweet was that Benicio and Alicia actually dated in real life during the making of this movie! How Sweet! Even though the movie got bad reviews, i really enjoyed it. Not only that, but it is clean enough to watch with younger kids in the room.To me, it seems like the perfect date movie or whenever you just feel like watching a movie. Another plus is that christopher walken is in the movie and he has made a lot of movies and he is well known. There were so many funny and sweet performances. Christopher plays uncle ray, Emily's uncle, and ever since she was born, he has looked out for her as if he was her father. He would protect her in anyway he could, even if that means killing vincent, the car thief, who could put her in jail. There was only one think that i can think of that was really weird and that was the preview, i had never actually watched it before, but it didn't really showcase the movie for what it was! i would have done it completely different, but otherwise the movie was sooooooo great!!!!(plus there were a lot of nice cars)

    I sure did enjoy the review by Luvmymom and many other reviews here. I saw the 51% rating at the header and I am sad for the 49% that found no joy here. My Mom was - is - the finest, most Motherly human being on Planet Earth, possibly the entire Universe. A beautiful and proud Italian Gal, but more to the point a Human Gal - Mom and Dad were colorblind as to race and never locked our front door - "What if one of our friends or neighbors has an emergency and needs our phone or something?" - that was the basic way of life at our various San Fran and Brisbane households. Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Emily Hope is a mess. She has an unresolved issue with a cold father that has not shown her any warmth throughout her young life. That is why she devises a plan to get even with the old man by staging her own kidnap in exchange for one million dollars ransom. Alexander Hope, the father, decides to go along in paying the ransom. Neither Emily nor Alexander are prepared for what happens next. The supposedly kidnapped girl decided to hide in the trunk of her fancy BMW parked at a car park, where she was to have been found. Vincent, a young criminal, steals the car for a client, not realizing there is a woman in the trunk. Vincent gets much more than what he bargained for, as he gets stuck with Emily, something that never entered in his plans. This 1997 Columbia Pictures release was a vehicle for Alicia Silverstone, the young actress that made a success out of her first big role in "Clueless". She was one of the producers of the film with her newly formed company. Unfortunately, the star cast herself against an actor that stole the picture from under her. It is Benicio Del Toro who is the real star of the film. Perhaps with another team, "Excess Baggage" might have turned out differently, but as directed by Marco Brambilla, it does not go anywhere. Based on a story by Max Adams, the material adaptation for the screen is too predictable and it is a waste Christopher Walken's talent, who has a small part.

    When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied. Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P ) All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief. Fans of the "Clueless" starlet may find "Excess Baggage" a puzzling departure for Silverstone who wielded ultimate creative authority over both script and casting. Perhaps she is more to blame for the muddled quality of "Excess Baggage" than either Brambilla or the writers. Never as entertaining as "Clueless" but better than "Batman & Robin," "Excess Baggage" arrives as something of a letdown after Silverstone's long screen absence. Cast as Emily T. Hope, the moody daughter of a man richer than Donald Trump, Silverstone constantly struggles to elicit her icy hearted, corporate father's affections. Australian actor Jack ("'Breaker' Morant") Thompson plays the father who has grown weary of his daughter's outlandish schemes to attract his attention. When he sent her away to a boarding school, Emily torched the place. As "Excess Baggage" unfolds, she has convinced not only her father but also the FBI that kidnappers are holding her for a million dollar ransom. Lamely, Emily hopes that her rescue from her bogus kidnappers will rekindle her papa's love. So she gags, tapes and cuffs herself before she jumps into the trunk (not a stunt you should try) of her BMW. Just as it looks as if everything is going Emily's way, a car thief spots her Beamer in a parking garage and steals it as she lies helpless in the trunk. No sooner does Vincent (Benicio Del Toro) wheel his latest trophy onto the street than a swarm of police cars descends on him. A tire-screeching chase ensues, and Vincent manages to shake his pursuers. He pulls into a nondescript warehouse that conceals his stolen vehicles. Vincent is an expert car thief who boosts expensive sports cars. When he puts the car on the rack, he notices that it wobbles. Imagine his shock when he finds a babe chick inside bound and gagged. Vincent slams the trunk! Since he cannot think of anything else, he calls his partner-in-crime Greg (Harry Connick, Jr), a car salesman. Meanwhile, Emily's suspicious father calls in his right hand man, Uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) to find his daughter. After Emily breaks out of the car, she calls pop, but hangs up when Vincent returns. Eventually, Vincent decides to leave her on foot far out in the forest. That's when he discovers her identity and that his car warehouse stands in a pile of smoking ashes. Now, the guys who paid Vincent to steal the cars (Nicholas Turturro & Michael Bowen) want their $200-thousand dollars back. Spotting Emily, they pull guns on Vincent and take Emily hostage with a million dollar ransom demand. It seems that "Excess Baggage" is a series of kidnappings and abductions. The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

Del Toro was paid handsomely for the thefts and those who handed over the cash want it back because their cars went kaboom. If he could just get the money to them (Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen), perhaps Del Toro could still escape relatively unscathed, but then Silverstone's uncle enters the picture and complicates matters. That uncle is played (thankfully) by Christopher Walken and he "holds onto" the money in the duffle bag until Del Toro takes him to Silverstone as confirmation that she's okay. Then Turturro and Bowen realize that Silverstone could bring a hefty payday to them, so a real kidnapping will commence (Silverstone wasn't forthcoming to Del Toro, making her father think he had in fact took her hostage and "had her touch his penis"!), with Del Toro and Walken having to join forces to intervene. Personally, as much as I loved Silverstone in Clueless (1995) back in the day, I found her damn near insufferable in Excess Baggage. She reminded me of those spoiled brats needing to use shock methods to get Daddy Warbucks' attention. She is a difficult, pain-in-the-ass for Del Toro who just needs to deposit her some place and be done with her. But you wouldn't have a romantic comedy if it ended thirty minutes into the film with Del Toro and Silverstone parting ways (which, realistically, would have happened fifteen minutes in, but I digressÂ…). Walken, thank goodness, rescues us from a complete failure with his effortless command of the screen as the "fixer" who knows how to get things done for his brother. My favorite scene (well, all of Walken's scenes are worthwhile, but this one specifically made me smile) has Del Toro awakening to discover Walken hovering over him (inside a hideaway cabin of Del Toro's). I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it. Del Toro does his actor-studio shtick, using his hands and shrugging a lot, but he'd make up for this rather annoying performance later with great work in the likes of Traffic (2000), The Hunted (2003), 21 Grams (2003), and Savages (2012). He does convey obvious frustration which, considering what his character must tolerate thanks to Silverstone's immature antics, makes perfect sense. Consider this a waste of talent, with a nice rock soundtrack, and a Walken supporting part to treasure. Nothing more or less.

    "Emily" (played by Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, spoiled daughter of a corrupt millionaire named "Alexander" (Jack Thompson). She feels unloved and in this particular case, she is, as her father devotes more time and concern to his shady business than he does to her. So, in order to feel wanted, she devises her own kidnap scheme and after tying herself up gets into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately for her (and everyone else in this case), a car thief named "Vincent" (Benicio Del Toro) decides to steal the car not realizing she is in the trunk. Upon hearing a noise he opens it and that's when things really begin to go wrong for him. Now, while this may not be a side-splitting comedy, it does have some pretty funny moments. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the dim-witted thief who has to contend with a spoiled brat and finds out all too soon that she is more than he can handle. And while Alicia Silverstone may have been nominated for a "Razzie" for her performance, I didn't think she was that bad at all. Yes, there were a couple of weak spots here and there. But overall, I thought her acting was just fine for the part. Likewise, Christopher Walken performed in his usual high-level manner as "Ray", the bodyguard of Alexander, who probably understands Emily more than anyone. All things considered, I thought that this was a delightful movie deserving higher marks than some critics have given.

    A spoilt brat of a girl ('Emily' played by Alicia Silverstone) fakes her own kidnapping to spite her (very) wealthy father, but her plans to be found 'safe' locked in the trunk of her car go awry when an 'innocent' car thief ('Vincent' played by a charming Benicio Del Toro) steals the vehicle. There are several plot developments from this point forward involving a couple of heists, some dangerous small-time thugs looking for money owed to them, and a clumsy romance between Emily and Vincent. Chris Walken plays Emily's Uncle Ray, a savvy ex-military type who unravels the story behind the events more quickly than the hapless FBI agents. Walken is fabulous, and really connects the parts of the story, offering his own brand of menace (watch for a great scene where he tosses a giant redneck-type through a restaurant window), perhaps resembling a less-hostile, but relentless 1st generation Antone Chigurh (the Javier Bardem character from 'No Country for Old Men'). Remember though: this is a heist-gone-wrong-romantic-comedy -- so, things never get too 'dicey'. Also shining are Michael Bowen (popular TV actor) and Nicholas Turturro (of the famous Turturro family), particularly the latter. They portray the small-time hoods, trying to get into a larger game, but clearly out of their element. One of the beauties of these lower-budget 'heist' flicks can be the prospect of playing a great villain, and there are a few distinct opportunities in this film. (I wonder if those who rated the film poorly missed that). A parallel example of what I mean is John Lithgow in Sylvester Stallone's 'Cliffhanger', a film that had little going for it, other than Lithgow's brilliant villain mastermind. Walken and Tuturro almost carry Excess Baggage by themselves, but the leads (Silverstone and Del Torro) work a special chemistry themselves. Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    If truth be told, I appreciated Excess Baggage!!(now stare at the title!!!) I actually liked all of the characters and how emily hope ( alicia silverstone) and Vincent( Benicio Del Toro) were so appealing jointly. To me , they represented someone needing someone else, or Emily needing the love and support of Vincent. I could watch this movie everyday! Another thing i loved about this movie was how sweet it was!! Alicia plays a spoiled rich girl who never got the love she wanted from her busy father, and plus her father would rather attend a business meeting than even talk to her. how rude!! And then she meets vincent and at first she is scared but then they sort of have an understanding of each other. (Plus Benicio is really hot in this movie!!!)Vincent,in a way, takes care of emily and fills that empty spot in her heart. He would take care of her much better than her own father. Vincent can't stand that even her own father wouldn't give her the love that she needs.It was a really beautiful movie and also it was Alicia Silverstones Debut of producing! Another thing i thought was sweet was that Benicio and Alicia actually dated in real life during the making of this movie! How Sweet! Even though the movie got bad reviews, i really enjoyed it. Not only that, but it is clean enough to watch with younger kids in the room.To me, it seems like the perfect date movie or whenever you just feel like watching a movie. Another plus is that christopher walken is in the movie and he has made a lot of movies and he is well known. There were so many funny and sweet performances. Christopher plays uncle ray, Emily's uncle, and ever since she was born, he has looked out for her as if he was her father. He would protect her in anyway he could, even if that means killing vincent, the car thief, who could put her in jail. There was only one think that i can think of that was really weird and that was the preview, i had never actually watched it before, but it didn't really showcase the movie for what it was! i would have done it completely different, but otherwise the movie was sooooooo great!!!!(plus there were a lot of nice cars)

    I sure did enjoy the review by Luvmymom and many other reviews here. I saw the 51% rating at the header and I am sad for the 49% that found no joy here. My Mom was - is - the finest, most Motherly human being on Planet Earth, possibly the entire Universe. A beautiful and proud Italian Gal, but more to the point a Human Gal - Mom and Dad were colorblind as to race and never locked our front door - "What if one of our friends or neighbors has an emergency and needs our phone or something?" - that was the basic way of life at our various San Fran and Brisbane households. Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Emily Hope is a mess. She has an unresolved issue with a cold father that has not shown her any warmth throughout her young life. That is why she devises a plan to get even with the old man by staging her own kidnap in exchange for one million dollars ransom. Alexander Hope, the father, decides to go along in paying the ransom. Neither Emily nor Alexander are prepared for what happens next. The supposedly kidnapped girl decided to hide in the trunk of her fancy BMW parked at a car park, where she was to have been found. Vincent, a young criminal, steals the car for a client, not realizing there is a woman in the trunk. Vincent gets much more than what he bargained for, as he gets stuck with Emily, something that never entered in his plans. This 1997 Columbia Pictures release was a vehicle for Alicia Silverstone, the young actress that made a success out of her first big role in "Clueless". She was one of the producers of the film with her newly formed company. Unfortunately, the star cast herself against an actor that stole the picture from under her. It is Benicio Del Toro who is the real star of the film. Perhaps with another team, "Excess Baggage" might have turned out differently, but as directed by Marco Brambilla, it does not go anywhere. Based on a story by Max Adams, the material adaptation for the screen is too predictable and it is a waste Christopher Walken's talent, who has a small part.

    When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied. Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P ) All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief. Fans of the "Clueless" starlet may find "Excess Baggage" a puzzling departure for Silverstone who wielded ultimate creative authority over both script and casting. Perhaps she is more to blame for the muddled quality of "Excess Baggage" than either Brambilla or the writers. Never as entertaining as "Clueless" but better than "Batman & Robin," "Excess Baggage" arrives as something of a letdown after Silverstone's long screen absence. Cast as Emily T. Hope, the moody daughter of a man richer than Donald Trump, Silverstone constantly struggles to elicit her icy hearted, corporate father's affections. Australian actor Jack ("'Breaker' Morant") Thompson plays the father who has grown weary of his daughter's outlandish schemes to attract his attention. When he sent her away to a boarding school, Emily torched the place. As "Excess Baggage" unfolds, she has convinced not only her father but also the FBI that kidnappers are holding her for a million dollar ransom. Lamely, Emily hopes that her rescue from her bogus kidnappers will rekindle her papa's love. So she gags, tapes and cuffs herself before she jumps into the trunk (not a stunt you should try) of her BMW. Just as it looks as if everything is going Emily's way, a car thief spots her Beamer in a parking garage and steals it as she lies helpless in the trunk. No sooner does Vincent (Benicio Del Toro) wheel his latest trophy onto the street than a swarm of police cars descends on him. A tire-screeching chase ensues, and Vincent manages to shake his pursuers. He pulls into a nondescript warehouse that conceals his stolen vehicles. Vincent is an expert car thief who boosts expensive sports cars. When he puts the car on the rack, he notices that it wobbles. Imagine his shock when he finds a babe chick inside bound and gagged. Vincent slams the trunk! Since he cannot think of anything else, he calls his partner-in-crime Greg (Harry Connick, Jr), a car salesman. Meanwhile, Emily's suspicious father calls in his right hand man, Uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) to find his daughter. After Emily breaks out of the car, she calls pop, but hangs up when Vincent returns. Eventually, Vincent decides to leave her on foot far out in the forest. That's when he discovers her identity and that his car warehouse stands in a pile of smoking ashes. Now, the guys who paid Vincent to steal the cars (Nicholas Turturro & Michael Bowen) want their $200-thousand dollars back. Spotting Emily, they pull guns on Vincent and take Emily hostage with a million dollar ransom demand. It seems that "Excess Baggage" is a series of kidnappings and abductions. The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

    Okay, so people might think I'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one. But I was sitting here the other night, we just moved into a new house. I love the new environment, and I was ready for the new year. I was up late, as always, and this movie came on TBS. I had just watched Clueless with Alicia in, and I thought if I could stay awake long enough, I would watch this. I love Walken and Silverstone, but had never seen Toro in much. So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didn't matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said "you don't have to be drunk to kiss me"...and he said "I'm not drunk"...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever he's talking to her dad, and he says, "Are you telling me I've only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do?" Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And they're sitting there in the trunk and he says "what a view"..she says "What makes it a view?" he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think that's clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You won't hate it then!

    I'm in love with Alicia Silverstone, and though I'd like to get between her legs, this flick really stinks. The story, thin as it is, involves a girl who fakes her own kidnapping so her elusive father will pay more attention to her. If you think it gets any more complex than that, think again. For the next 100 minutes, Alicia engages in some throw-away banter with a car thief (Benicio del Toro), her drab uncle, and a couple of moronic henchmen. The final scene breeds claustrophobia and stupidity. Very weird-looking film; the kind of movie you should only see on an airplane that's about to crash or at a drive-in where the speakers don't work.

So it assumed Del Toro is the kidnapper and thanks to a feisty, uncooperative (and misbehaving) Silverstone, he loses control of the situation, the garage (thanks to a lit cigarette from Silverstone, hurled into a barrel with rags inside) sets afire with all the stolen, high-priced luxury vehicles going up in explosive flames as well.

I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it.

Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    If truth be told, I appreciated Excess Baggage!!(now stare at the title!!!) I actually liked all of the characters and how emily hope ( alicia silverstone) and Vincent( Benicio Del Toro) were so appealing jointly. To me , they represented someone needing someone else, or Emily needing the love and support of Vincent. I could watch this movie everyday! Another thing i loved about this movie was how sweet it was!! Alicia plays a spoiled rich girl who never got the love she wanted from her busy father, and plus her father would rather attend a business meeting than even talk to her. how rude!! And then she meets vincent and at first she is scared but then they sort of have an understanding of each other. (Plus Benicio is really hot in this movie!!!)Vincent,in a way, takes care of emily and fills that empty spot in her heart. He would take care of her much better than her own father. Vincent can't stand that even her own father wouldn't give her the love that she needs.It was a really beautiful movie and also it was Alicia Silverstones Debut of producing! Another thing i thought was sweet was that Benicio and Alicia actually dated in real life during the making of this movie! How Sweet! Even though the movie got bad reviews, i really enjoyed it. Not only that, but it is clean enough to watch with younger kids in the room.To me, it seems like the perfect date movie or whenever you just feel like watching a movie. Another plus is that christopher walken is in the movie and he has made a lot of movies and he is well known. There were so many funny and sweet performances. Christopher plays uncle ray, Emily's uncle, and ever since she was born, he has looked out for her as if he was her father. He would protect her in anyway he could, even if that means killing vincent, the car thief, who could put her in jail. There was only one think that i can think of that was really weird and that was the preview, i had never actually watched it before, but it didn't really showcase the movie for what it was! i would have done it completely different, but otherwise the movie was sooooooo great!!!!(plus there were a lot of nice cars)

    I sure did enjoy the review by Luvmymom and many other reviews here. I saw the 51% rating at the header and I am sad for the 49% that found no joy here. My Mom was - is - the finest, most Motherly human being on Planet Earth, possibly the entire Universe. A beautiful and proud Italian Gal, but more to the point a Human Gal - Mom and Dad were colorblind as to race and never locked our front door - "What if one of our friends or neighbors has an emergency and needs our phone or something?" - that was the basic way of life at our various San Fran and Brisbane households. Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Emily Hope is a mess. She has an unresolved issue with a cold father that has not shown her any warmth throughout her young life. That is why she devises a plan to get even with the old man by staging her own kidnap in exchange for one million dollars ransom. Alexander Hope, the father, decides to go along in paying the ransom. Neither Emily nor Alexander are prepared for what happens next. The supposedly kidnapped girl decided to hide in the trunk of her fancy BMW parked at a car park, where she was to have been found. Vincent, a young criminal, steals the car for a client, not realizing there is a woman in the trunk. Vincent gets much more than what he bargained for, as he gets stuck with Emily, something that never entered in his plans. This 1997 Columbia Pictures release was a vehicle for Alicia Silverstone, the young actress that made a success out of her first big role in "Clueless". She was one of the producers of the film with her newly formed company. Unfortunately, the star cast herself against an actor that stole the picture from under her. It is Benicio Del Toro who is the real star of the film. Perhaps with another team, "Excess Baggage" might have turned out differently, but as directed by Marco Brambilla, it does not go anywhere. Based on a story by Max Adams, the material adaptation for the screen is too predictable and it is a waste Christopher Walken's talent, who has a small part.

    When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied. Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P ) All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief. Fans of the "Clueless" starlet may find "Excess Baggage" a puzzling departure for Silverstone who wielded ultimate creative authority over both script and casting. Perhaps she is more to blame for the muddled quality of "Excess Baggage" than either Brambilla or the writers. Never as entertaining as "Clueless" but better than "Batman & Robin," "Excess Baggage" arrives as something of a letdown after Silverstone's long screen absence. Cast as Emily T. Hope, the moody daughter of a man richer than Donald Trump, Silverstone constantly struggles to elicit her icy hearted, corporate father's affections. Australian actor Jack ("'Breaker' Morant") Thompson plays the father who has grown weary of his daughter's outlandish schemes to attract his attention. When he sent her away to a boarding school, Emily torched the place. As "Excess Baggage" unfolds, she has convinced not only her father but also the FBI that kidnappers are holding her for a million dollar ransom. Lamely, Emily hopes that her rescue from her bogus kidnappers will rekindle her papa's love. So she gags, tapes and cuffs herself before she jumps into the trunk (not a stunt you should try) of her BMW. Just as it looks as if everything is going Emily's way, a car thief spots her Beamer in a parking garage and steals it as she lies helpless in the trunk. No sooner does Vincent (Benicio Del Toro) wheel his latest trophy onto the street than a swarm of police cars descends on him. A tire-screeching chase ensues, and Vincent manages to shake his pursuers. He pulls into a nondescript warehouse that conceals his stolen vehicles. Vincent is an expert car thief who boosts expensive sports cars. When he puts the car on the rack, he notices that it wobbles. Imagine his shock when he finds a babe chick inside bound and gagged. Vincent slams the trunk! Since he cannot think of anything else, he calls his partner-in-crime Greg (Harry Connick, Jr), a car salesman. Meanwhile, Emily's suspicious father calls in his right hand man, Uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) to find his daughter. After Emily breaks out of the car, she calls pop, but hangs up when Vincent returns. Eventually, Vincent decides to leave her on foot far out in the forest. That's when he discovers her identity and that his car warehouse stands in a pile of smoking ashes. Now, the guys who paid Vincent to steal the cars (Nicholas Turturro & Michael Bowen) want their $200-thousand dollars back. Spotting Emily, they pull guns on Vincent and take Emily hostage with a million dollar ransom demand. It seems that "Excess Baggage" is a series of kidnappings and abductions. The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

    Okay, so people might think I'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one. But I was sitting here the other night, we just moved into a new house. I love the new environment, and I was ready for the new year. I was up late, as always, and this movie came on TBS. I had just watched Clueless with Alicia in, and I thought if I could stay awake long enough, I would watch this. I love Walken and Silverstone, but had never seen Toro in much. So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didn't matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said "you don't have to be drunk to kiss me"...and he said "I'm not drunk"...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever he's talking to her dad, and he says, "Are you telling me I've only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do?" Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And they're sitting there in the trunk and he says "what a view"..she says "What makes it a view?" he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think that's clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You won't hate it then!

    I'm in love with Alicia Silverstone, and though I'd like to get between her legs, this flick really stinks. The story, thin as it is, involves a girl who fakes her own kidnapping so her elusive father will pay more attention to her. If you think it gets any more complex than that, think again. For the next 100 minutes, Alicia engages in some throw-away banter with a car thief (Benicio del Toro), her drab uncle, and a couple of moronic henchmen. The final scene breeds claustrophobia and stupidity. Very weird-looking film; the kind of movie you should only see on an airplane that's about to crash or at a drive-in where the speakers don't work.

    A displeased pampered princess (Alicia Silverstone), whose crooked millionaire father (Jack Thompson) has problems arising with the Securities and Exchange Commission (taps on his phone by the authorities hoping he will give away details to put him in prison), stages a phony kidnapping just to get pops' attention (and hopefully his support; she later even envisions him personally removing her from the trunk with affection on his face and in voice to the media gathering about), but her car is stolen by a master thief (Benicio Del Toro), taken to his garage housing other confiscated vehicles. So it assumed Del Toro is the kidnapper and thanks to a feisty, uncooperative (and misbehaving) Silverstone, he loses control of the situation, the garage (thanks to a lit cigarette from Silverstone, hurled into a barrel with rags inside) sets afire with all the stolen, high-priced luxury vehicles going up in explosive flames as well. Del Toro was paid handsomely for the thefts and those who handed over the cash want it back because their cars went kaboom. If he could just get the money to them (Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen), perhaps Del Toro could still escape relatively unscathed, but then Silverstone's uncle enters the picture and complicates matters. That uncle is played (thankfully) by Christopher Walken and he "holds onto" the money in the duffle bag until Del Toro takes him to Silverstone as confirmation that she's okay. Then Turturro and Bowen realize that Silverstone could bring a hefty payday to them, so a real kidnapping will commence (Silverstone wasn't forthcoming to Del Toro, making her father think he had in fact took her hostage and "had her touch his penis"!), with Del Toro and Walken having to join forces to intervene. Personally, as much as I loved Silverstone in Clueless (1995) back in the day, I found her damn near insufferable in Excess Baggage. She reminded me of those spoiled brats needing to use shock methods to get Daddy Warbucks' attention. She is a difficult, pain-in-the-ass for Del Toro who just needs to deposit her some place and be done with her. But you wouldn't have a romantic comedy if it ended thirty minutes into the film with Del Toro and Silverstone parting ways (which, realistically, would have happened fifteen minutes in, but I digressÂ…). Walken, thank goodness, rescues us from a complete failure with his effortless command of the screen as the "fixer" who knows how to get things done for his brother. My favorite scene (well, all of Walken's scenes are worthwhile, but this one specifically made me smile) has Del Toro awakening to discover Walken hovering over him (inside a hideaway cabin of Del Toro's). I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it. Del Toro does his actor-studio shtick, using his hands and shrugging a lot, but he'd make up for this rather annoying performance later with great work in the likes of Traffic (2000), The Hunted (2003), 21 Grams (2003), and Savages (2012). He does convey obvious frustration which, considering what his character must tolerate thanks to Silverstone's immature antics, makes perfect sense. Consider this a waste of talent, with a nice rock soundtrack, and a Walken supporting part to treasure. Nothing more or less.

    "Emily" (played by Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, spoiled daughter of a corrupt millionaire named "Alexander" (Jack Thompson). She feels unloved and in this particular case, she is, as her father devotes more time and concern to his shady business than he does to her. So, in order to feel wanted, she devises her own kidnap scheme and after tying herself up gets into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately for her (and everyone else in this case), a car thief named "Vincent" (Benicio Del Toro) decides to steal the car not realizing she is in the trunk. Upon hearing a noise he opens it and that's when things really begin to go wrong for him. Now, while this may not be a side-splitting comedy, it does have some pretty funny moments. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the dim-witted thief who has to contend with a spoiled brat and finds out all too soon that she is more than he can handle. And while Alicia Silverstone may have been nominated for a "Razzie" for her performance, I didn't think she was that bad at all. Yes, there were a couple of weak spots here and there. But overall, I thought her acting was just fine for the part. Likewise, Christopher Walken performed in his usual high-level manner as "Ray", the bodyguard of Alexander, who probably understands Emily more than anyone. All things considered, I thought that this was a delightful movie deserving higher marks than some critics have given.

    A spoilt brat of a girl ('Emily' played by Alicia Silverstone) fakes her own kidnapping to spite her (very) wealthy father, but her plans to be found 'safe' locked in the trunk of her car go awry when an 'innocent' car thief ('Vincent' played by a charming Benicio Del Toro) steals the vehicle. There are several plot developments from this point forward involving a couple of heists, some dangerous small-time thugs looking for money owed to them, and a clumsy romance between Emily and Vincent. Chris Walken plays Emily's Uncle Ray, a savvy ex-military type who unravels the story behind the events more quickly than the hapless FBI agents. Walken is fabulous, and really connects the parts of the story, offering his own brand of menace (watch for a great scene where he tosses a giant redneck-type through a restaurant window), perhaps resembling a less-hostile, but relentless 1st generation Antone Chigurh (the Javier Bardem character from 'No Country for Old Men'). Remember though: this is a heist-gone-wrong-romantic-comedy -- so, things never get too 'dicey'. Also shining are Michael Bowen (popular TV actor) and Nicholas Turturro (of the famous Turturro family), particularly the latter. They portray the small-time hoods, trying to get into a larger game, but clearly out of their element. One of the beauties of these lower-budget 'heist' flicks can be the prospect of playing a great villain, and there are a few distinct opportunities in this film. (I wonder if those who rated the film poorly missed that). A parallel example of what I mean is John Lithgow in Sylvester Stallone's 'Cliffhanger', a film that had little going for it, other than Lithgow's brilliant villain mastermind. Walken and Tuturro almost carry Excess Baggage by themselves, but the leads (Silverstone and Del Torro) work a special chemistry themselves. Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied. Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P ) All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief. Fans of the "Clueless" starlet may find "Excess Baggage" a puzzling departure for Silverstone who wielded ultimate creative authority over both script and casting. Perhaps she is more to blame for the muddled quality of "Excess Baggage" than either Brambilla or the writers. Never as entertaining as "Clueless" but better than "Batman & Robin," "Excess Baggage" arrives as something of a letdown after Silverstone's long screen absence. Cast as Emily T. Hope, the moody daughter of a man richer than Donald Trump, Silverstone constantly struggles to elicit her icy hearted, corporate father's affections. Australian actor Jack ("'Breaker' Morant") Thompson plays the father who has grown weary of his daughter's outlandish schemes to attract his attention. When he sent her away to a boarding school, Emily torched the place. As "Excess Baggage" unfolds, she has convinced not only her father but also the FBI that kidnappers are holding her for a million dollar ransom. Lamely, Emily hopes that her rescue from her bogus kidnappers will rekindle her papa's love. So she gags, tapes and cuffs herself before she jumps into the trunk (not a stunt you should try) of her BMW. Just as it looks as if everything is going Emily's way, a car thief spots her Beamer in a parking garage and steals it as she lies helpless in the trunk. No sooner does Vincent (Benicio Del Toro) wheel his latest trophy onto the street than a swarm of police cars descends on him. A tire-screeching chase ensues, and Vincent manages to shake his pursuers. He pulls into a nondescript warehouse that conceals his stolen vehicles. Vincent is an expert car thief who boosts expensive sports cars. When he puts the car on the rack, he notices that it wobbles. Imagine his shock when he finds a babe chick inside bound and gagged. Vincent slams the trunk! Since he cannot think of anything else, he calls his partner-in-crime Greg (Harry Connick, Jr), a car salesman. Meanwhile, Emily's suspicious father calls in his right hand man, Uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) to find his daughter. After Emily breaks out of the car, she calls pop, but hangs up when Vincent returns. Eventually, Vincent decides to leave her on foot far out in the forest. That's when he discovers her identity and that his car warehouse stands in a pile of smoking ashes. Now, the guys who paid Vincent to steal the cars (Nicholas Turturro & Michael Bowen) want their $200-thousand dollars back. Spotting Emily, they pull guns on Vincent and take Emily hostage with a million dollar ransom demand. It seems that "Excess Baggage" is a series of kidnappings and abductions. The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

    Okay, so people might think I'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one. But I was sitting here the other night, we just moved into a new house. I love the new environment, and I was ready for the new year. I was up late, as always, and this movie came on TBS. I had just watched Clueless with Alicia in, and I thought if I could stay awake long enough, I would watch this. I love Walken and Silverstone, but had never seen Toro in much. So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didn't matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said "you don't have to be drunk to kiss me"...and he said "I'm not drunk"...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever he's talking to her dad, and he says, "Are you telling me I've only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do?" Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And they're sitting there in the trunk and he says "what a view"..she says "What makes it a view?" he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think that's clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You won't hate it then!

    I'm in love with Alicia Silverstone, and though I'd like to get between her legs, this flick really stinks. The story, thin as it is, involves a girl who fakes her own kidnapping so her elusive father will pay more attention to her. If you think it gets any more complex than that, think again. For the next 100 minutes, Alicia engages in some throw-away banter with a car thief (Benicio del Toro), her drab uncle, and a couple of moronic henchmen. The final scene breeds claustrophobia and stupidity. Very weird-looking film; the kind of movie you should only see on an airplane that's about to crash or at a drive-in where the speakers don't work.

    A displeased pampered princess (Alicia Silverstone), whose crooked millionaire father (Jack Thompson) has problems arising with the Securities and Exchange Commission (taps on his phone by the authorities hoping he will give away details to put him in prison), stages a phony kidnapping just to get pops' attention (and hopefully his support; she later even envisions him personally removing her from the trunk with affection on his face and in voice to the media gathering about), but her car is stolen by a master thief (Benicio Del Toro), taken to his garage housing other confiscated vehicles. So it assumed Del Toro is the kidnapper and thanks to a feisty, uncooperative (and misbehaving) Silverstone, he loses control of the situation, the garage (thanks to a lit cigarette from Silverstone, hurled into a barrel with rags inside) sets afire with all the stolen, high-priced luxury vehicles going up in explosive flames as well. Del Toro was paid handsomely for the thefts and those who handed over the cash want it back because their cars went kaboom. If he could just get the money to them (Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen), perhaps Del Toro could still escape relatively unscathed, but then Silverstone's uncle enters the picture and complicates matters. That uncle is played (thankfully) by Christopher Walken and he "holds onto" the money in the duffle bag until Del Toro takes him to Silverstone as confirmation that she's okay. Then Turturro and Bowen realize that Silverstone could bring a hefty payday to them, so a real kidnapping will commence (Silverstone wasn't forthcoming to Del Toro, making her father think he had in fact took her hostage and "had her touch his penis"!), with Del Toro and Walken having to join forces to intervene. Personally, as much as I loved Silverstone in Clueless (1995) back in the day, I found her damn near insufferable in Excess Baggage. She reminded me of those spoiled brats needing to use shock methods to get Daddy Warbucks' attention. She is a difficult, pain-in-the-ass for Del Toro who just needs to deposit her some place and be done with her. But you wouldn't have a romantic comedy if it ended thirty minutes into the film with Del Toro and Silverstone parting ways (which, realistically, would have happened fifteen minutes in, but I digressÂ…). Walken, thank goodness, rescues us from a complete failure with his effortless command of the screen as the "fixer" who knows how to get things done for his brother. My favorite scene (well, all of Walken's scenes are worthwhile, but this one specifically made me smile) has Del Toro awakening to discover Walken hovering over him (inside a hideaway cabin of Del Toro's). I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it. Del Toro does his actor-studio shtick, using his hands and shrugging a lot, but he'd make up for this rather annoying performance later with great work in the likes of Traffic (2000), The Hunted (2003), 21 Grams (2003), and Savages (2012). He does convey obvious frustration which, considering what his character must tolerate thanks to Silverstone's immature antics, makes perfect sense. Consider this a waste of talent, with a nice rock soundtrack, and a Walken supporting part to treasure. Nothing more or less.

    "Emily" (played by Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, spoiled daughter of a corrupt millionaire named "Alexander" (Jack Thompson). She feels unloved and in this particular case, she is, as her father devotes more time and concern to his shady business than he does to her. So, in order to feel wanted, she devises her own kidnap scheme and after tying herself up gets into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately for her (and everyone else in this case), a car thief named "Vincent" (Benicio Del Toro) decides to steal the car not realizing she is in the trunk. Upon hearing a noise he opens it and that's when things really begin to go wrong for him. Now, while this may not be a side-splitting comedy, it does have some pretty funny moments. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the dim-witted thief who has to contend with a spoiled brat and finds out all too soon that she is more than he can handle. And while Alicia Silverstone may have been nominated for a "Razzie" for her performance, I didn't think she was that bad at all. Yes, there were a couple of weak spots here and there. But overall, I thought her acting was just fine for the part. Likewise, Christopher Walken performed in his usual high-level manner as "Ray", the bodyguard of Alexander, who probably understands Emily more than anyone. All things considered, I thought that this was a delightful movie deserving higher marks than some critics have given.

    A spoilt brat of a girl ('Emily' played by Alicia Silverstone) fakes her own kidnapping to spite her (very) wealthy father, but her plans to be found 'safe' locked in the trunk of her car go awry when an 'innocent' car thief ('Vincent' played by a charming Benicio Del Toro) steals the vehicle. There are several plot developments from this point forward involving a couple of heists, some dangerous small-time thugs looking for money owed to them, and a clumsy romance between Emily and Vincent. Chris Walken plays Emily's Uncle Ray, a savvy ex-military type who unravels the story behind the events more quickly than the hapless FBI agents. Walken is fabulous, and really connects the parts of the story, offering his own brand of menace (watch for a great scene where he tosses a giant redneck-type through a restaurant window), perhaps resembling a less-hostile, but relentless 1st generation Antone Chigurh (the Javier Bardem character from 'No Country for Old Men'). Remember though: this is a heist-gone-wrong-romantic-comedy -- so, things never get too 'dicey'. Also shining are Michael Bowen (popular TV actor) and Nicholas Turturro (of the famous Turturro family), particularly the latter. They portray the small-time hoods, trying to get into a larger game, but clearly out of their element. One of the beauties of these lower-budget 'heist' flicks can be the prospect of playing a great villain, and there are a few distinct opportunities in this film. (I wonder if those who rated the film poorly missed that). A parallel example of what I mean is John Lithgow in Sylvester Stallone's 'Cliffhanger', a film that had little going for it, other than Lithgow's brilliant villain mastermind. Walken and Tuturro almost carry Excess Baggage by themselves, but the leads (Silverstone and Del Torro) work a special chemistry themselves. Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    If truth be told, I appreciated Excess Baggage!!(now stare at the title!!!) I actually liked all of the characters and how emily hope ( alicia silverstone) and Vincent( Benicio Del Toro) were so appealing jointly. To me , they represented someone needing someone else, or Emily needing the love and support of Vincent. I could watch this movie everyday! Another thing i loved about this movie was how sweet it was!! Alicia plays a spoiled rich girl who never got the love she wanted from her busy father, and plus her father would rather attend a business meeting than even talk to her. how rude!! And then she meets vincent and at first she is scared but then they sort of have an understanding of each other. (Plus Benicio is really hot in this movie!!!)Vincent,in a way, takes care of emily and fills that empty spot in her heart. He would take care of her much better than her own father. Vincent can't stand that even her own father wouldn't give her the love that she needs.It was a really beautiful movie and also it was Alicia Silverstones Debut of producing! Another thing i thought was sweet was that Benicio and Alicia actually dated in real life during the making of this movie! How Sweet! Even though the movie got bad reviews, i really enjoyed it. Not only that, but it is clean enough to watch with younger kids in the room.To me, it seems like the perfect date movie or whenever you just feel like watching a movie. Another plus is that christopher walken is in the movie and he has made a lot of movies and he is well known. There were so many funny and sweet performances. Christopher plays uncle ray, Emily's uncle, and ever since she was born, he has looked out for her as if he was her father. He would protect her in anyway he could, even if that means killing vincent, the car thief, who could put her in jail. There was only one think that i can think of that was really weird and that was the preview, i had never actually watched it before, but it didn't really showcase the movie for what it was! i would have done it completely different, but otherwise the movie was sooooooo great!!!!(plus there were a lot of nice cars)

    I sure did enjoy the review by Luvmymom and many other reviews here. I saw the 51% rating at the header and I am sad for the 49% that found no joy here. My Mom was - is - the finest, most Motherly human being on Planet Earth, possibly the entire Universe. A beautiful and proud Italian Gal, but more to the point a Human Gal - Mom and Dad were colorblind as to race and never locked our front door - "What if one of our friends or neighbors has an emergency and needs our phone or something?" - that was the basic way of life at our various San Fran and Brisbane households. Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Emily Hope is a mess. She has an unresolved issue with a cold father that has not shown her any warmth throughout her young life. That is why she devises a plan to get even with the old man by staging her own kidnap in exchange for one million dollars ransom. Alexander Hope, the father, decides to go along in paying the ransom. Neither Emily nor Alexander are prepared for what happens next. The supposedly kidnapped girl decided to hide in the trunk of her fancy BMW parked at a car park, where she was to have been found. Vincent, a young criminal, steals the car for a client, not realizing there is a woman in the trunk. Vincent gets much more than what he bargained for, as he gets stuck with Emily, something that never entered in his plans. This 1997 Columbia Pictures release was a vehicle for Alicia Silverstone, the young actress that made a success out of her first big role in "Clueless". She was one of the producers of the film with her newly formed company. Unfortunately, the star cast herself against an actor that stole the picture from under her. It is Benicio Del Toro who is the real star of the film. Perhaps with another team, "Excess Baggage" might have turned out differently, but as directed by Marco Brambilla, it does not go anywhere. Based on a story by Max Adams, the material adaptation for the screen is too predictable and it is a waste Christopher Walken's talent, who has a small part.

So I started watching it. I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling. The way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk, and was extorting her dad for money. I first thought she really wanted the money. Then I figured out it didn't matter, she wanted attention. It was a cry for help. Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there. The scene where Uncle Ray (Walken) saw she framed her fire news article...was hilarious and brilliant. And the scene at Knotty Pines where she said "you don't have to be drunk to kiss me"...and he said "I'm not drunk"...absolutely brilliant. Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching. I loved it whenever he's talking to her dad, and he says, "Are you telling me I've only known this girl two days and already I care more about her than you do?" Wonderful. And the scene at the end of the movie...I TOTALLY knew he was in the trunk. And they're sitting there in the trunk and he says "what a view"..she says "What makes it a view?" he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk. Perfect ending. Okay, so I loved the movie. I think that's clear. But if any person watched this and hated it, they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it. You won't hate it then!

    I'm in love with Alicia Silverstone, and though I'd like to get between her legs, this flick really stinks. The story, thin as it is, involves a girl who fakes her own kidnapping so her elusive father will pay more attention to her. If you think it gets any more complex than that, think again. For the next 100 minutes, Alicia engages in some throw-away banter with a car thief (Benicio del Toro), her drab uncle, and a couple of moronic henchmen. The final scene breeds claustrophobia and stupidity. Very weird-looking film; the kind of movie you should only see on an airplane that's about to crash or at a drive-in where the speakers don't work.

    A displeased pampered princess (Alicia Silverstone), whose crooked millionaire father (Jack Thompson) has problems arising with the Securities and Exchange Commission (taps on his phone by the authorities hoping he will give away details to put him in prison), stages a phony kidnapping just to get pops' attention (and hopefully his support; she later even envisions him personally removing her from the trunk with affection on his face and in voice to the media gathering about), but her car is stolen by a master thief (Benicio Del Toro), taken to his garage housing other confiscated vehicles. So it assumed Del Toro is the kidnapper and thanks to a feisty, uncooperative (and misbehaving) Silverstone, he loses control of the situation, the garage (thanks to a lit cigarette from Silverstone, hurled into a barrel with rags inside) sets afire with all the stolen, high-priced luxury vehicles going up in explosive flames as well. Del Toro was paid handsomely for the thefts and those who handed over the cash want it back because their cars went kaboom. If he could just get the money to them (Nicholas Turturro and Michael Bowen), perhaps Del Toro could still escape relatively unscathed, but then Silverstone's uncle enters the picture and complicates matters. That uncle is played (thankfully) by Christopher Walken and he "holds onto" the money in the duffle bag until Del Toro takes him to Silverstone as confirmation that she's okay. Then Turturro and Bowen realize that Silverstone could bring a hefty payday to them, so a real kidnapping will commence (Silverstone wasn't forthcoming to Del Toro, making her father think he had in fact took her hostage and "had her touch his penis"!), with Del Toro and Walken having to join forces to intervene. Personally, as much as I loved Silverstone in Clueless (1995) back in the day, I found her damn near insufferable in Excess Baggage. She reminded me of those spoiled brats needing to use shock methods to get Daddy Warbucks' attention. She is a difficult, pain-in-the-ass for Del Toro who just needs to deposit her some place and be done with her. But you wouldn't have a romantic comedy if it ended thirty minutes into the film with Del Toro and Silverstone parting ways (which, realistically, would have happened fifteen minutes in, but I digressÂ…). Walken, thank goodness, rescues us from a complete failure with his effortless command of the screen as the "fixer" who knows how to get things done for his brother. My favorite scene (well, all of Walken's scenes are worthwhile, but this one specifically made me smile) has Del Toro awakening to discover Walken hovering over him (inside a hideaway cabin of Del Toro's). I have always liked how Walken can project so many attributes like charm, appeal, with a smooth control even when circumstances might result in panic, while, at the same time, there's always that thought he could kill your ass without blinking, without breaking a sweat. I never thought he would in this film, but, just the same, when he looks down at Del Toro, for a moment, he seemed primed to put a bullet in him. It is like a smile could (or could not) hide violent intent. While Silverstone snarls in a diner scene as Walken walks in (with Del Toro hoping he gets the money to take to his car dealer partner, Harry Connick, Jr. ("Gosh.")), sitting at the table, trying to convince her to come home to Alexander, he carries her along with expert ease, the conversation made bearable just because is in it. Del Toro does his actor-studio shtick, using his hands and shrugging a lot, but he'd make up for this rather annoying performance later with great work in the likes of Traffic (2000), The Hunted (2003), 21 Grams (2003), and Savages (2012). He does convey obvious frustration which, considering what his character must tolerate thanks to Silverstone's immature antics, makes perfect sense. Consider this a waste of talent, with a nice rock soundtrack, and a Walken supporting part to treasure. Nothing more or less.

    "Emily" (played by Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, spoiled daughter of a corrupt millionaire named "Alexander" (Jack Thompson). She feels unloved and in this particular case, she is, as her father devotes more time and concern to his shady business than he does to her. So, in order to feel wanted, she devises her own kidnap scheme and after tying herself up gets into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately for her (and everyone else in this case), a car thief named "Vincent" (Benicio Del Toro) decides to steal the car not realizing she is in the trunk. Upon hearing a noise he opens it and that's when things really begin to go wrong for him. Now, while this may not be a side-splitting comedy, it does have some pretty funny moments. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the dim-witted thief who has to contend with a spoiled brat and finds out all too soon that she is more than he can handle. And while Alicia Silverstone may have been nominated for a "Razzie" for her performance, I didn't think she was that bad at all. Yes, there were a couple of weak spots here and there. But overall, I thought her acting was just fine for the part. Likewise, Christopher Walken performed in his usual high-level manner as "Ray", the bodyguard of Alexander, who probably understands Emily more than anyone. All things considered, I thought that this was a delightful movie deserving higher marks than some critics have given.

    A spoilt brat of a girl ('Emily' played by Alicia Silverstone) fakes her own kidnapping to spite her (very) wealthy father, but her plans to be found 'safe' locked in the trunk of her car go awry when an 'innocent' car thief ('Vincent' played by a charming Benicio Del Toro) steals the vehicle. There are several plot developments from this point forward involving a couple of heists, some dangerous small-time thugs looking for money owed to them, and a clumsy romance between Emily and Vincent. Chris Walken plays Emily's Uncle Ray, a savvy ex-military type who unravels the story behind the events more quickly than the hapless FBI agents. Walken is fabulous, and really connects the parts of the story, offering his own brand of menace (watch for a great scene where he tosses a giant redneck-type through a restaurant window), perhaps resembling a less-hostile, but relentless 1st generation Antone Chigurh (the Javier Bardem character from 'No Country for Old Men'). Remember though: this is a heist-gone-wrong-romantic-comedy -- so, things never get too 'dicey'. Also shining are Michael Bowen (popular TV actor) and Nicholas Turturro (of the famous Turturro family), particularly the latter. They portray the small-time hoods, trying to get into a larger game, but clearly out of their element. One of the beauties of these lower-budget 'heist' flicks can be the prospect of playing a great villain, and there are a few distinct opportunities in this film. (I wonder if those who rated the film poorly missed that). A parallel example of what I mean is John Lithgow in Sylvester Stallone's 'Cliffhanger', a film that had little going for it, other than Lithgow's brilliant villain mastermind. Walken and Tuturro almost carry Excess Baggage by themselves, but the leads (Silverstone and Del Torro) work a special chemistry themselves. Del Torro is the real deal, by the way - a man who takes characterization very seriously and has played several bizarre roles to prove it. In a unique way, he does much more with the Vincent character than there was on paper. So, enjoy this PG-13 romcom - these films are a shrinking commodity. You can catch this on Netflix, if you can't find the a rental DVD.

    If truth be told, I appreciated Excess Baggage!!(now stare at the title!!!) I actually liked all of the characters and how emily hope ( alicia silverstone) and Vincent( Benicio Del Toro) were so appealing jointly. To me , they represented someone needing someone else, or Emily needing the love and support of Vincent. I could watch this movie everyday! Another thing i loved about this movie was how sweet it was!! Alicia plays a spoiled rich girl who never got the love she wanted from her busy father, and plus her father would rather attend a business meeting than even talk to her. how rude!! And then she meets vincent and at first she is scared but then they sort of have an understanding of each other. (Plus Benicio is really hot in this movie!!!)Vincent,in a way, takes care of emily and fills that empty spot in her heart. He would take care of her much better than her own father. Vincent can't stand that even her own father wouldn't give her the love that she needs.It was a really beautiful movie and also it was Alicia Silverstones Debut of producing! Another thing i thought was sweet was that Benicio and Alicia actually dated in real life during the making of this movie! How Sweet! Even though the movie got bad reviews, i really enjoyed it. Not only that, but it is clean enough to watch with younger kids in the room.To me, it seems like the perfect date movie or whenever you just feel like watching a movie. Another plus is that christopher walken is in the movie and he has made a lot of movies and he is well known. There were so many funny and sweet performances. Christopher plays uncle ray, Emily's uncle, and ever since she was born, he has looked out for her as if he was her father. He would protect her in anyway he could, even if that means killing vincent, the car thief, who could put her in jail. There was only one think that i can think of that was really weird and that was the preview, i had never actually watched it before, but it didn't really showcase the movie for what it was! i would have done it completely different, but otherwise the movie was sooooooo great!!!!(plus there were a lot of nice cars)

    I sure did enjoy the review by Luvmymom and many other reviews here. I saw the 51% rating at the header and I am sad for the 49% that found no joy here. My Mom was - is - the finest, most Motherly human being on Planet Earth, possibly the entire Universe. A beautiful and proud Italian Gal, but more to the point a Human Gal - Mom and Dad were colorblind as to race and never locked our front door - "What if one of our friends or neighbors has an emergency and needs our phone or something?" - that was the basic way of life at our various San Fran and Brisbane households. Never went wrong with this way of life, even though some junkies who learned about our lax security walked in and stole my Brother Aaron's life savings while the family was at my Father's funeral in 1986. Both those unfortunates died soon after, due to their own druggie actions, leaving behind good decent families who are still our close friends. But I am getting way off track here. This film, these actor-artists, the writer and director, have put together a true piece of Magic. I just want to add: The first time Dave Matthews Crash...comes in like a warm rainfall, is during the scene in the motel when Alicia says to Benicio, "You don't have to be drunk to kiss me". When Crash began playing, I was reminded of the first time I heard this wonderful sound. I was crippled - for only a year, thank Ma Nature - by getting hit by a car while jogging, and I spent many months in 1997-8 staying in my room, feeling sorry for myself, and then I bought this Dave Matthews cassette...saved my Spirit, it did. I just got out of a wheelchair last year after a fall from a scaffold. This fine movie is helping save my life, that it is.

    Emily Hope is a mess. She has an unresolved issue with a cold father that has not shown her any warmth throughout her young life. That is why she devises a plan to get even with the old man by staging her own kidnap in exchange for one million dollars ransom. Alexander Hope, the father, decides to go along in paying the ransom. Neither Emily nor Alexander are prepared for what happens next. The supposedly kidnapped girl decided to hide in the trunk of her fancy BMW parked at a car park, where she was to have been found. Vincent, a young criminal, steals the car for a client, not realizing there is a woman in the trunk. Vincent gets much more than what he bargained for, as he gets stuck with Emily, something that never entered in his plans. This 1997 Columbia Pictures release was a vehicle for Alicia Silverstone, the young actress that made a success out of her first big role in "Clueless". She was one of the producers of the film with her newly formed company. Unfortunately, the star cast herself against an actor that stole the picture from under her. It is Benicio Del Toro who is the real star of the film. Perhaps with another team, "Excess Baggage" might have turned out differently, but as directed by Marco Brambilla, it does not go anywhere. Based on a story by Max Adams, the material adaptation for the screen is too predictable and it is a waste Christopher Walken's talent, who has a small part.

    When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied. Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P ) All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.

    Actress Alicia Silverstone's latest starring vehicle "Excess Baggage" opens amid a frenzy of activity like an inspired screwball comedy. Midway through the movie director Marco Brambilla and his scribes flagrantly shift gears from a sparkling comedy to a tedious kidnapping drama about an unhappy heiress and a woebegone car thief. Fans of the "Clueless" starlet may find "Excess Baggage" a puzzling departure for Silverstone who wielded ultimate creative authority over both script and casting. Perhaps she is more to blame for the muddled quality of "Excess Baggage" than either Brambilla or the writers. Never as entertaining as "Clueless" but better than "Batman & Robin," "Excess Baggage" arrives as something of a letdown after Silverstone's long screen absence. Cast as Emily T. Hope, the moody daughter of a man richer than Donald Trump, Silverstone constantly struggles to elicit her icy hearted, corporate father's affections. Australian actor Jack ("'Breaker' Morant") Thompson plays the father who has grown weary of his daughter's outlandish schemes to attract his attention. When he sent her away to a boarding school, Emily torched the place. As "Excess Baggage" unfolds, she has convinced not only her father but also the FBI that kidnappers are holding her for a million dollar ransom. Lamely, Emily hopes that her rescue from her bogus kidnappers will rekindle her papa's love. So she gags, tapes and cuffs herself before she jumps into the trunk (not a stunt you should try) of her BMW. Just as it looks as if everything is going Emily's way, a car thief spots her Beamer in a parking garage and steals it as she lies helpless in the trunk. No sooner does Vincent (Benicio Del Toro) wheel his latest trophy onto the street than a swarm of police cars descends on him. A tire-screeching chase ensues, and Vincent manages to shake his pursuers. He pulls into a nondescript warehouse that conceals his stolen vehicles. Vincent is an expert car thief who boosts expensive sports cars. When he puts the car on the rack, he notices that it wobbles. Imagine his shock when he finds a babe chick inside bound and gagged. Vincent slams the trunk! Since he cannot think of anything else, he calls his partner-in-crime Greg (Harry Connick, Jr), a car salesman. Meanwhile, Emily's suspicious father calls in his right hand man, Uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) to find his daughter. After Emily breaks out of the car, she calls pop, but hangs up when Vincent returns. Eventually, Vincent decides to leave her on foot far out in the forest. That's when he discovers her identity and that his car warehouse stands in a pile of smoking ashes. Now, the guys who paid Vincent to steal the cars (Nicholas Turturro & Michael Bowen) want their $200-thousand dollars back. Spotting Emily, they pull guns on Vincent and take Emily hostage with a million dollar ransom demand. It seems that "Excess Baggage" is a series of kidnappings and abductions. The inventive but offbeat script hangs together by the most improbable threads. The more unlikely the circumstances are, the more colossal the dramatic outcome appears. Anyway, whoever thought to demand realism out of an Alicia Silverstone comedy? Suddenly, "Excess Baggage" wanders off on other subplots that distract from Vincent and Emily. Not only that but the story slows down and a pall hovers over the characters. Realism tries to intrude on an Alicia Silverstone movie. Screwball comedy dictates that Vincent heists the same car that Emily uses to stash her body. A smoldering cigarette that she tosses into a rag bin later engulfs Vincent's neat hideout in flames. Neither Vincent nor Emily appreciate their predicament. Just when Vincent rids himself of Emily, he needs her and she needs him. Later, when Ray captures Vincent and confiscates his money, Emily comes to his rescue. Less than amused, the gruff Ray explains to Emily that she has committed a serious crime. They need to use Vincent as the fall guy to take her place. "Clueless" it ain't. Director Marco Brambilla, whose only previous directing credit is Sly Stallone's "Demolition Man," whips these disparate elements together with such verve and style until Emily and Vincent team up. The action stalls out along with the humor and movie goes in search of a genre. Is this still a comedy? Or is it a social problem film? About the same time that the story loses its momentum, we learn what an insensitive brute her father truly is. Jack Thompson's stuck-up dad feels absolutely no sympathy for his daughter and finds a business appointment infinitely preferable to her attentions. Writer Max D. Adams and comedy veterans Dick Clement and Ian Frenais fumble in their efforts to maintain a consistent feeling and atmosphere in the story. After Emily and Vincent fall for each other, Alicia Silverstone's character spends several scenes off-camera. We get to follow the misadventures of poor Vincent who gets kidnapped not only by Ray but his criminal cronies. The focus shifts from the burgeoning relationship between Emily and Vincent and settles on the mechanics of a crime thriller. There's even a shoot-out at the end, and Alicia drives a forklift with the front end of a car on it through a wall. The filmmakers clearly lose interest in their characters when they let the leads take a back seat to the crazy twists and turns of the plot. But the ending isn't so neat. Emily's father couldn't care two bits for his daughter and wings it off to a business conference. If anybody holds this uneven caper together it's star and producer Alicia Silverstone. Although she is looking a little fleshy around the curves, Silverstone's china-doll eyes and her crooked smile are all the charisma this movie should have needed. The amazing thing is that Silverstone allows her character to be shuttled off-camera, something that rarely happened in "Clueless."

    Okay, so people might think I'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10. The usual response and comment everywhere I look seems to be a negative one.
