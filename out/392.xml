    Mel Gibson both directs and stars in this moving film as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher who was partially disfigured in a car accident ten years previous, and where a student was incinerated. Ever since, he has lived on the edge of town, an object of fear and ridicule, until one young man named Charles 'Chuck' Norstadt(Nick Stahl) befriends him with the aim of being tutored by him, since his grades need improvement, and Chuck is not afraid. However, his family is still suspicious, and Chuck will uncover the truth about McLeod that will change their lives forever. Mel Gibson does a fine job directing and acting, building a believable portrait of this scarred man who needs a second chance from a society that has wrongly judged him, and a young boy who will have his life turned around, leading to a most fitting finale.

    I've not seen more than a handful of Mel's movies. Certainly all the violent money makers, but last night, I watched "TMWaF". I am not a movie critic and don't know how to critique movies, but this movie, I loved from beginning to end. Every actor played their role (large or small) so well it was like I lived in the town and was watching everyday life. I won't go on and on. I recommend the movie to all, even those hooked on the latest zombie movies or those youngsters who crave violent action flicks. Take some time out, watch this one and prepare to see a movie that will keep you thinking. A movie that shows what MOVIES can be. BTW I was left with a question: did all the town shun and despise Justin McLeod? I would have thought at least some of the women would have felt sorry for him seeing the undamaged half of his face and seeing how he would have been the handsomest man any of them could have known and just wondering "ah, what could have been".

    The movie I reviewed was The Man without a Face starring Mel Gibson as Justin McLeod and newcomer Nick Stahl as Chuck Norstad. The movie was set in scenic upper class neighborhood in Cranesport Maine. The movie focuses on a twelve year old boy, Chuck, who has experienced a difficult childhood, never knowing what really happened to his dad, and a mother that was more interested in finding a new husband than raising her son. Chuck's dream was to get into military school but unfortunately he was unable to pass the entrance exam. Through circumstances, he ran into Justin McLeod a passed educator that was disfigured in a car accident that killed one of his students. Because of his close relationship with his past student, it was implied that his relationship may have been improper so he gave up teaching and lived in isolation. The theme of this movie was based on the relationship between Chuck, a struggling youth without a father figure and a teacher who truly cared about educating his students. As their relationship builds to a true friendship through relentless hours of studying and practice test, Chuck prepares for the entrance exam. Eventually rumors in the small community began to swirl, and once again the relationship he has with his student is again in question. While there is no merit to these accusations, it is deemed by the authorities that they should no longer have contact with one another. Chuck goes on to be successful and graduate military school while Justin McLeod stands in the background demonstrating his undying support for his friend. To develop the theme, there are several scenes that demonstrate Chuck's troubled upbringing, through fights with his sister and a lack of assistance from his mother. While other scenes show the town talking about Mr. McLeod and the circumstances that disfigured his face. All of these scenes helped to isolate each of these individuals leading them only to lean on each other. A movie with a similar theme was Gran Torino. While the movie was not based necessarily on a relationship, it focused on an individual and a group of people that their nationality that did not fit in to current society. The two relied on each other and carried each other through the difficult time. The director chose various techniques to demonstrate the relationship between the two friends. First, the camera angles were direct close-ups that helped the audience understand what they were feeling. There expressions on their face made you love them, understand their pain and hoping the relationship would last forever. The setting also helped you to understand their isolation. Often their talks were in beautiful settings, alone with nobody around. The theme of this movie identified the need we all have to be understood and have people that truly care about our success. The relationship they built was based on a true friendship that could not be altered by influence from the outside. I can only imagine how good the world could be if we all could find the person who brought out the best in us.

    This film is underrated, but being underrated can be a good thing because it might mean that behind the low rating hides a movie that isn't given the deserved credit. Here's a prime example of that. 'The Man Without a Face' is a funny, human, sensitive, touching and harsh movie. It is a lesson of life and it deals a lot with life's problems and serious stuff. Besides, there is also a lot of comedy, which is a surprise for such a serious film. But the combination of these different elements is effective. Mel Gibson is someone I tend to find overrated, as an actor and as a director. But with 'The Man Without a Face' he made a great movie and proved that after all he is worth something as a director and as an actor, thanks to his great acting as Justin McLeod. Nick Stahl is brilliant as Chuck Norstadt. I love his acting, he really convinces in whatever he does in this movie, he's truly that expressive. Chuck is so funny: his hilarious lines, his strong personality, his devilish sense of humor and the extremely goofy facial expressions he does when he is completely "in the moon". He is also very inquisitive, determined and stubborn, It's also funny that, although he is 14 years old, his face is very childish, making him look much younger than he is. However, Chuck is also a troubled and enraged boy. I can't blame him: with a father like he had, a mother like that and an older half-sister like that, no wonder he is a little crazy. Only his younger half-sister is decent. The film can also count with the help of a nice soundtrack (with soft instrumental music and a great oldie song - "Born a Woman" by Sandy Posey), as well as the simple fact that it takes place in Maine - which means it has beautiful vistas, all natural. It is also worth for the old cars and those acquaintanceships in family and with neighbors and friends. Like I said before, this movie is a lesson of life. You can actually learn a lot from it. It's interesting what is possible to learn from it. Title in Portugal: 'Um Homem Sem Rosto'.

    This was a well acted movie, nothing to grandeur to be sure but interesting enough. The film has a boy who actually wants to go to a boarding school which is kind of a nice change of pace, but he does not really have the grades to do so. Well lucky for him there is a recluse living nearby, and he just happens to be a teacher. Well he tries to get this guy's help, but the guy is rather hesitant to do so. He is disfigured thanks to an incident in the past and he is frowned upon by the community. He does take the boy in though as you knew he would have to do seeing as there would not be much of a movie if he did not and the two form a bit of a bond. Not really a big one where the guy makes up for the fact the boy is fatherless, but a student teacher one to be sure. Well something happens and the boy is caught at this mans house by some authorities and there is a big court scene and we learn why the man has lost half his face and why he is frowned upon by the community. Usually I would say this movie is trying to say people unjustly accuse people of things based on appearances and such, but it just does not work in this case as there was sufficient evidence and circumstances to believe the man could have done what he was accused of. Still, Mel Gibson turns in a good performance and it was somewhat entertaining to watch, just nothing that would top any favorite movie lists of mine.

    I first watched this film as a child. My imagination was immediately engrossed, and it hasn't since recovered. McLeod was a commanding figure to me. I related to Chuck on almost every level. I think McLeod's character was very well done. I think the story was standard, but that it was the atmosphere and the characters which carried the movie. What I loved most was McLeod's home and yard. The house is filled with nautical themes, books, and various antique collector items. There is an art studio, since he paints for Time Magazine. You hear the constant noise of falling waves and sea-gulls overhead. There is a blue lake in his back yard about an acre from the house, which itself is hugged by green trees in the front and the sides. But he is lonely. His only company is a German Shepherd named Mickey. He's alone because of his painful past. The reason he is 'without a face' is because he has burns over half his body from a car crash in which a boy was killed. The event was surrounded by controversy. People thought McLeod and the boy were having a sexual relationship of sorts, but the charges were dropped. McLeod was deeply hurt by the incident; not only because a boy died who he cared deeply about, but because of everyone's misperceptions and judgmentalism. So, he chooses to live alone in a big house and stay to himself. He preoccupies himself with building a boat, training his dog, reading books, creating models of ships, painting, playing chess, taking care of his horse, and making his usual trip to the grocery store. There is a very touching scene in which McLeod is brooding over his condition. He feels exiled from humanity. He is on a journey, but doesn't know where to go. Dramatic opera plays in the background. He reads the beginning lines of Virgil's Aenied. After reading, he holds a mirror up to his face, placing the edge on his nose, so that only the unscarred part of his face reflects. For a moment, he looks normal; but as he moves the mirror more and more to the left, more and more of the scars are laid bare, and he is disgusted. I think that is such a symbol of the human condition! Chuck is a dreamer, full of hope. His father killed himself in a mental institution; his mother is manipulative; his older half-sister is malicious; his younger half-sister is kind-hearted, but still only a child. He dreams of going to military school! The only problem is that you have to pass the entrance exams. You need to know Latin and some high-level mathematics. He is in need of a teacher. I won't get into all the details. The movie is great because of the growing relationship of McLeod and Chuck. The movie's scenes of their intimacy are truly delicious. For example, McLeod teaches Chuck how to read poetry and perform Shakespeare plays. McLeod takes home the poem 'High Flight' and reads it in his bathroom in a very sublime scene. All in all, a very good movie!

    I had never heard of this movie or the book it was taken from...but I watched it because of Mel Gibson, even though I am not a big fan of his, his movies are usually at least worth a look/see. I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this movie was and the lasting impression it has had on me. Many movies are so forgettable that after watching them they are soon forgotten. I marveled at how well the entire movie was directed and the sets, acting, screenplay were magnificent. The movie is about a young boy who feels different than others in his family and circle of friends. He meets and a strong friendship between the boy and Mel Gibsons character are forged. The movie is about being different and still normal, still with feelings, still with intelligence, still with passion. The only thing in the movie I might change would be the title, it just is not what I would consider a good name....A better choice might be "A Man and a Boy"... or something similar.

    I should perhaps point out that my comments below are based solely upon the film. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I have not read the original novel by Isabelle Holland- indeed, I had never previously heard of either the book or its author. Mel Gibson's first film as director is set during one summer in the late sixties. Charles Norstadt, a twelve-year-old boy, is on holiday with his mother and two half-sisters on an island off the coast of Maine. He has ambitions to attend the same military academy as his late father, who he believes was a war hero, but receives no encouragement from his mother, Catherine, who regards military schools as "fascist" and is firmly convinced that her son is too stupid to pass the entrance examination. Charles makes the acquaintance of Justin McLeod, a painter living in a large house on the island. Because of his reclusive nature, and because his face has been horribly disfigured in an accident, McLeod is treated with a mixture of fear and mockery by his neighbours, particularly the local children. Charles, however, discovers that McLeod was at one time a teacher, and asks him to tutor him for the entrance exam. The gruff, taciturn McLeod is at first reluctant, but he gradually warms to the boy, and a close friendship grows up between them. Charles comes to see him as a father-figure, especially after he makes the unwelcome discovery that his own father was not a war hero but an alcoholic who abandoned his family and later committed suicide. Gibson initially wanted to cast another actor as McLeod, but was eventually persuaded to play the role himself. I think that that was the right decision; I have not seen all his films as an actor, but of the ones I have seen I think that he gave his best performances in this one and in Zeffirelli's "Hamlet". McLeod is a complex character who is more than an innocent victim. He is also haunted by feelings of guilt arising out of the car accident in which he was injured and his passenger, one of his pupils, was killed. It is these guilt feelings which have led to his becoming a recluse and to his refusing to have plastic surgery to correct his disfigurement. His mentoring of Charles can be seen as an attempt to make amends for his past. The young Nick Stahl is also very good as Charles. Gibson has the reputation of being one of Hollywood's more conservative figures, and there are conservative aspects to "The Man without a Face". Although the film is set during the Vietnam War, a time when all things military were regarded with deep suspicion by a large section of American public opinion, Charles' ambition to attend a military academy is presented as a laudable one. The politically liberal Catherine is too wrapped up in her own emotional needs to consider those of her children. She has been married several times (her three children all have different fathers) and many of Charles' emotional problems stem from his unstable family background and the lack of a father-figure in his life. The title "The Man without a Face" can refer to the disfigured McLeod, but it can also refer to Charles' father who is "without a face" in the sense that his son has no mental image of him. In another respect, however, the film can be seen as having a liberal theme, although not in the narrowly political meaning of that word. The local people's distrust of McLeod does not derive solely from his disfigured appearance. He is also rumoured to be a paedophile, and his friendship with Charles is therefore seen by many, including the local police chief, as deeply suspicious. I note that one reviewer actually concludes that McLeod is a paedophile and that another thinks that the film would be more interesting if he were to be portrayed as one. I think both these viewpoints are wrong. It seems quite clear from the film that the relationship between McLeod and Charles is platonic and non-sexual. If it were otherwise McLeod would be a detestable character rather than a pitiable one, and the film's key theme- that of not judging people, particularly those who are in some way different, on the basis of suspicion, rumour and unfounded accusations- would be fatally undermined. Of Gibson's four films as a director I think that "The Man without a Face" is, together with the very different "The Passion of the Christ", the best. It is a well-told human drama, a sensitive exploration of the teacher-pupil relationship and of the corrosive effects of suspicion and prejudice. It is certainly better than the overblown and overrated "Braveheart" for which he won an Oscar. 8/10

    This was truly a heart-warming story; it was a mix of emotions -- sad, cheerful, humorous, and never boring. I can watch this movie a hundred times! Nick Stahl, even at a very young age, was an excellent actor. Every move, every expression added great humor and passion to each scene. At the beginning of the movie, it's fast-paced and energetic, but at the end it's really sad, so you'll need a box of tissue~ I was kind of disappointed at the end because Mel Gibson actually ends up being restrained from seeing Nick Stahl. Very sad. It wasn't lacking any quality at the end, so you cannot stay mad. But overall, you HAVE to watch this movie.

    This is one of my favourite films, Mel Gibson being my favourite actor has proved yet again what he can do with a role. Nick Stahl also does a brilliant job at playing Chuck Norstadt. Mel Gibson also made his Directing debut with this film and made it something special. A beautiful story about Chuck Norstadt (Stahl) who has an urge to get away from his family consisting of his mother (and her many husbands), his younger half sister & his older half sister who he has a bitter feud with. He is seen as a hard learner, this is where Justin McLeod (Gibson) comes in. Chuck in order to get away from his family must pass an exam to get into a Military Academy his father attended. Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck, until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship & judging people under assumptions.

Usually I would say this movie is trying to say people unjustly accuse people of things based on appearances and such, but it just does not work in this case as there was sufficient evidence and circumstances to believe the man could have done what he was accused of. Still, Mel Gibson turns in a good performance and it was somewhat entertaining to watch, just nothing that would top any favorite movie lists of mine.

    I first watched this film as a child. My imagination was immediately engrossed, and it hasn't since recovered. McLeod was a commanding figure to me. I related to Chuck on almost every level. I think McLeod's character was very well done. I think the story was standard, but that it was the atmosphere and the characters which carried the movie. What I loved most was McLeod's home and yard. The house is filled with nautical themes, books, and various antique collector items. There is an art studio, since he paints for Time Magazine. You hear the constant noise of falling waves and sea-gulls overhead. There is a blue lake in his back yard about an acre from the house, which itself is hugged by green trees in the front and the sides. But he is lonely. His only company is a German Shepherd named Mickey. He's alone because of his painful past. The reason he is 'without a face' is because he has burns over half his body from a car crash in which a boy was killed. The event was surrounded by controversy. People thought McLeod and the boy were having a sexual relationship of sorts, but the charges were dropped. McLeod was deeply hurt by the incident; not only because a boy died who he cared deeply about, but because of everyone's misperceptions and judgmentalism. So, he chooses to live alone in a big house and stay to himself. He preoccupies himself with building a boat, training his dog, reading books, creating models of ships, painting, playing chess, taking care of his horse, and making his usual trip to the grocery store. There is a very touching scene in which McLeod is brooding over his condition. He feels exiled from humanity. He is on a journey, but doesn't know where to go. Dramatic opera plays in the background. He reads the beginning lines of Virgil's Aenied. After reading, he holds a mirror up to his face, placing the edge on his nose, so that only the unscarred part of his face reflects. For a moment, he looks normal; but as he moves the mirror more and more to the left, more and more of the scars are laid bare, and he is disgusted. I think that is such a symbol of the human condition! Chuck is a dreamer, full of hope. His father killed himself in a mental institution; his mother is manipulative; his older half-sister is malicious; his younger half-sister is kind-hearted, but still only a child. He dreams of going to military school! The only problem is that you have to pass the entrance exams. You need to know Latin and some high-level mathematics. He is in need of a teacher. I won't get into all the details. The movie is great because of the growing relationship of McLeod and Chuck. The movie's scenes of their intimacy are truly delicious. For example, McLeod teaches Chuck how to read poetry and perform Shakespeare plays. McLeod takes home the poem 'High Flight' and reads it in his bathroom in a very sublime scene. All in all, a very good movie!

    I had never heard of this movie or the book it was taken from...but I watched it because of Mel Gibson, even though I am not a big fan of his, his movies are usually at least worth a look/see. I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this movie was and the lasting impression it has had on me. Many movies are so forgettable that after watching them they are soon forgotten. I marveled at how well the entire movie was directed and the sets, acting, screenplay were magnificent. The movie is about a young boy who feels different than others in his family and circle of friends. He meets and a strong friendship between the boy and Mel Gibsons character are forged. The movie is about being different and still normal, still with feelings, still with intelligence, still with passion. The only thing in the movie I might change would be the title, it just is not what I would consider a good name....A better choice might be "A Man and a Boy"... or something similar.

    I should perhaps point out that my comments below are based solely upon the film. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I have not read the original novel by Isabelle Holland- indeed, I had never previously heard of either the book or its author. Mel Gibson's first film as director is set during one summer in the late sixties. Charles Norstadt, a twelve-year-old boy, is on holiday with his mother and two half-sisters on an island off the coast of Maine. He has ambitions to attend the same military academy as his late father, who he believes was a war hero, but receives no encouragement from his mother, Catherine, who regards military schools as "fascist" and is firmly convinced that her son is too stupid to pass the entrance examination. Charles makes the acquaintance of Justin McLeod, a painter living in a large house on the island. Because of his reclusive nature, and because his face has been horribly disfigured in an accident, McLeod is treated with a mixture of fear and mockery by his neighbours, particularly the local children. Charles, however, discovers that McLeod was at one time a teacher, and asks him to tutor him for the entrance exam. The gruff, taciturn McLeod is at first reluctant, but he gradually warms to the boy, and a close friendship grows up between them. Charles comes to see him as a father-figure, especially after he makes the unwelcome discovery that his own father was not a war hero but an alcoholic who abandoned his family and later committed suicide. Gibson initially wanted to cast another actor as McLeod, but was eventually persuaded to play the role himself. I think that that was the right decision; I have not seen all his films as an actor, but of the ones I have seen I think that he gave his best performances in this one and in Zeffirelli's "Hamlet". McLeod is a complex character who is more than an innocent victim. He is also haunted by feelings of guilt arising out of the car accident in which he was injured and his passenger, one of his pupils, was killed. It is these guilt feelings which have led to his becoming a recluse and to his refusing to have plastic surgery to correct his disfigurement. His mentoring of Charles can be seen as an attempt to make amends for his past. The young Nick Stahl is also very good as Charles. Gibson has the reputation of being one of Hollywood's more conservative figures, and there are conservative aspects to "The Man without a Face". Although the film is set during the Vietnam War, a time when all things military were regarded with deep suspicion by a large section of American public opinion, Charles' ambition to attend a military academy is presented as a laudable one. The politically liberal Catherine is too wrapped up in her own emotional needs to consider those of her children. She has been married several times (her three children all have different fathers) and many of Charles' emotional problems stem from his unstable family background and the lack of a father-figure in his life. The title "The Man without a Face" can refer to the disfigured McLeod, but it can also refer to Charles' father who is "without a face" in the sense that his son has no mental image of him. In another respect, however, the film can be seen as having a liberal theme, although not in the narrowly political meaning of that word. The local people's distrust of McLeod does not derive solely from his disfigured appearance. He is also rumoured to be a paedophile, and his friendship with Charles is therefore seen by many, including the local police chief, as deeply suspicious. I note that one reviewer actually concludes that McLeod is a paedophile and that another thinks that the film would be more interesting if he were to be portrayed as one. I think both these viewpoints are wrong. It seems quite clear from the film that the relationship between McLeod and Charles is platonic and non-sexual. If it were otherwise McLeod would be a detestable character rather than a pitiable one, and the film's key theme- that of not judging people, particularly those who are in some way different, on the basis of suspicion, rumour and unfounded accusations- would be fatally undermined. Of Gibson's four films as a director I think that "The Man without a Face" is, together with the very different "The Passion of the Christ", the best. It is a well-told human drama, a sensitive exploration of the teacher-pupil relationship and of the corrosive effects of suspicion and prejudice. It is certainly better than the overblown and overrated "Braveheart" for which he won an Oscar. 8/10

    This was truly a heart-warming story; it was a mix of emotions -- sad, cheerful, humorous, and never boring. I can watch this movie a hundred times! Nick Stahl, even at a very young age, was an excellent actor. Every move, every expression added great humor and passion to each scene. At the beginning of the movie, it's fast-paced and energetic, but at the end it's really sad, so you'll need a box of tissue~ I was kind of disappointed at the end because Mel Gibson actually ends up being restrained from seeing Nick Stahl. Very sad. It wasn't lacking any quality at the end, so you cannot stay mad. But overall, you HAVE to watch this movie.

    This is one of my favourite films, Mel Gibson being my favourite actor has proved yet again what he can do with a role. Nick Stahl also does a brilliant job at playing Chuck Norstadt. Mel Gibson also made his Directing debut with this film and made it something special. A beautiful story about Chuck Norstadt (Stahl) who has an urge to get away from his family consisting of his mother (and her many husbands), his younger half sister & his older half sister who he has a bitter feud with. He is seen as a hard learner, this is where Justin McLeod (Gibson) comes in. Chuck in order to get away from his family must pass an exam to get into a Military Academy his father attended. Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck, until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship & judging people under assumptions.

    Mel Gibson both directs and stars in this moving film as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher who was partially disfigured in a car accident ten years previous, and where a student was incinerated. Ever since, he has lived on the edge of town, an object of fear and ridicule, until one young man named Charles 'Chuck' Norstadt(Nick Stahl) befriends him with the aim of being tutored by him, since his grades need improvement, and Chuck is not afraid. However, his family is still suspicious, and Chuck will uncover the truth about McLeod that will change their lives forever. Mel Gibson does a fine job directing and acting, building a believable portrait of this scarred man who needs a second chance from a society that has wrongly judged him, and a young boy who will have his life turned around, leading to a most fitting finale.

    I've not seen more than a handful of Mel's movies. Certainly all the violent money makers, but last night, I watched "TMWaF". I am not a movie critic and don't know how to critique movies, but this movie, I loved from beginning to end. Every actor played their role (large or small) so well it was like I lived in the town and was watching everyday life. I won't go on and on. I recommend the movie to all, even those hooked on the latest zombie movies or those youngsters who crave violent action flicks. Take some time out, watch this one and prepare to see a movie that will keep you thinking. A movie that shows what MOVIES can be. BTW I was left with a question: did all the town shun and despise Justin McLeod? I would have thought at least some of the women would have felt sorry for him seeing the undamaged half of his face and seeing how he would have been the handsomest man any of them could have known and just wondering "ah, what could have been".

    The movie I reviewed was The Man without a Face starring Mel Gibson as Justin McLeod and newcomer Nick Stahl as Chuck Norstad. The movie was set in scenic upper class neighborhood in Cranesport Maine. The movie focuses on a twelve year old boy, Chuck, who has experienced a difficult childhood, never knowing what really happened to his dad, and a mother that was more interested in finding a new husband than raising her son. Chuck's dream was to get into military school but unfortunately he was unable to pass the entrance exam. Through circumstances, he ran into Justin McLeod a passed educator that was disfigured in a car accident that killed one of his students. Because of his close relationship with his past student, it was implied that his relationship may have been improper so he gave up teaching and lived in isolation. The theme of this movie was based on the relationship between Chuck, a struggling youth without a father figure and a teacher who truly cared about educating his students. As their relationship builds to a true friendship through relentless hours of studying and practice test, Chuck prepares for the entrance exam. Eventually rumors in the small community began to swirl, and once again the relationship he has with his student is again in question. While there is no merit to these accusations, it is deemed by the authorities that they should no longer have contact with one another. Chuck goes on to be successful and graduate military school while Justin McLeod stands in the background demonstrating his undying support for his friend. To develop the theme, there are several scenes that demonstrate Chuck's troubled upbringing, through fights with his sister and a lack of assistance from his mother. While other scenes show the town talking about Mr. McLeod and the circumstances that disfigured his face. All of these scenes helped to isolate each of these individuals leading them only to lean on each other. A movie with a similar theme was Gran Torino. While the movie was not based necessarily on a relationship, it focused on an individual and a group of people that their nationality that did not fit in to current society. The two relied on each other and carried each other through the difficult time. The director chose various techniques to demonstrate the relationship between the two friends. First, the camera angles were direct close-ups that helped the audience understand what they were feeling. There expressions on their face made you love them, understand their pain and hoping the relationship would last forever. The setting also helped you to understand their isolation. Often their talks were in beautiful settings, alone with nobody around. The theme of this movie identified the need we all have to be understood and have people that truly care about our success. The relationship they built was based on a true friendship that could not be altered by influence from the outside. I can only imagine how good the world could be if we all could find the person who brought out the best in us.

    This film is underrated, but being underrated can be a good thing because it might mean that behind the low rating hides a movie that isn't given the deserved credit. Here's a prime example of that. 'The Man Without a Face' is a funny, human, sensitive, touching and harsh movie. It is a lesson of life and it deals a lot with life's problems and serious stuff. Besides, there is also a lot of comedy, which is a surprise for such a serious film. But the combination of these different elements is effective. Mel Gibson is someone I tend to find overrated, as an actor and as a director. But with 'The Man Without a Face' he made a great movie and proved that after all he is worth something as a director and as an actor, thanks to his great acting as Justin McLeod. Nick Stahl is brilliant as Chuck Norstadt. I love his acting, he really convinces in whatever he does in this movie, he's truly that expressive. Chuck is so funny: his hilarious lines, his strong personality, his devilish sense of humor and the extremely goofy facial expressions he does when he is completely "in the moon". He is also very inquisitive, determined and stubborn, It's also funny that, although he is 14 years old, his face is very childish, making him look much younger than he is. However, Chuck is also a troubled and enraged boy. I can't blame him: with a father like he had, a mother like that and an older half-sister like that, no wonder he is a little crazy. Only his younger half-sister is decent. The film can also count with the help of a nice soundtrack (with soft instrumental music and a great oldie song - "Born a Woman" by Sandy Posey), as well as the simple fact that it takes place in Maine - which means it has beautiful vistas, all natural. It is also worth for the old cars and those acquaintanceships in family and with neighbors and friends. Like I said before, this movie is a lesson of life. You can actually learn a lot from it. It's interesting what is possible to learn from it. Title in Portugal: 'Um Homem Sem Rosto'.

    This was a well acted movie, nothing to grandeur to be sure but interesting enough. The film has a boy who actually wants to go to a boarding school which is kind of a nice change of pace, but he does not really have the grades to do so. Well lucky for him there is a recluse living nearby, and he just happens to be a teacher. Well he tries to get this guy's help, but the guy is rather hesitant to do so. He is disfigured thanks to an incident in the past and he is frowned upon by the community. He does take the boy in though as you knew he would have to do seeing as there would not be much of a movie if he did not and the two form a bit of a bond. Not really a big one where the guy makes up for the fact the boy is fatherless, but a student teacher one to be sure. Well something happens and the boy is caught at this mans house by some authorities and there is a big court scene and we learn why the man has lost half his face and why he is frowned upon by the community. Usually I would say this movie is trying to say people unjustly accuse people of things based on appearances and such, but it just does not work in this case as there was sufficient evidence and circumstances to believe the man could have done what he was accused of.

Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck, until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship & judging people under assumptions.

    Mel Gibson both directs and stars in this moving film as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher who was partially disfigured in a car accident ten years previous, and where a student was incinerated. Ever since, he has lived on the edge of town, an object of fear and ridicule, until one young man named Charles 'Chuck' Norstadt(Nick Stahl) befriends him with the aim of being tutored by him, since his grades need improvement, and Chuck is not afraid. However, his family is still suspicious, and Chuck will uncover the truth about McLeod that will change their lives forever. Mel Gibson does a fine job directing and acting, building a believable portrait of this scarred man who needs a second chance from a society that has wrongly judged him, and a young boy who will have his life turned around, leading to a most fitting finale.

    I've not seen more than a handful of Mel's movies. Certainly all the violent money makers, but last night, I watched "TMWaF". I am not a movie critic and don't know how to critique movies, but this movie, I loved from beginning to end. Every actor played their role (large or small) so well it was like I lived in the town and was watching everyday life. I won't go on and on. I recommend the movie to all, even those hooked on the latest zombie movies or those youngsters who crave violent action flicks. Take some time out, watch this one and prepare to see a movie that will keep you thinking. A movie that shows what MOVIES can be. BTW I was left with a question: did all the town shun and despise Justin McLeod? I would have thought at least some of the women would have felt sorry for him seeing the undamaged half of his face and seeing how he would have been the handsomest man any of them could have known and just wondering "ah, what could have been".

    The movie I reviewed was The Man without a Face starring Mel Gibson as Justin McLeod and newcomer Nick Stahl as Chuck Norstad. The movie was set in scenic upper class neighborhood in Cranesport Maine. The movie focuses on a twelve year old boy, Chuck, who has experienced a difficult childhood, never knowing what really happened to his dad, and a mother that was more interested in finding a new husband than raising her son. Chuck's dream was to get into military school but unfortunately he was unable to pass the entrance exam. Through circumstances, he ran into Justin McLeod a passed educator that was disfigured in a car accident that killed one of his students. Because of his close relationship with his past student, it was implied that his relationship may have been improper so he gave up teaching and lived in isolation. The theme of this movie was based on the relationship between Chuck, a struggling youth without a father figure and a teacher who truly cared about educating his students. As their relationship builds to a true friendship through relentless hours of studying and practice test, Chuck prepares for the entrance exam. Eventually rumors in the small community began to swirl, and once again the relationship he has with his student is again in question. While there is no merit to these accusations, it is deemed by the authorities that they should no longer have contact with one another. Chuck goes on to be successful and graduate military school while Justin McLeod stands in the background demonstrating his undying support for his friend. To develop the theme, there are several scenes that demonstrate Chuck's troubled upbringing, through fights with his sister and a lack of assistance from his mother. While other scenes show the town talking about Mr. McLeod and the circumstances that disfigured his face. All of these scenes helped to isolate each of these individuals leading them only to lean on each other. A movie with a similar theme was Gran Torino. While the movie was not based necessarily on a relationship, it focused on an individual and a group of people that their nationality that did not fit in to current society. The two relied on each other and carried each other through the difficult time. The director chose various techniques to demonstrate the relationship between the two friends. First, the camera angles were direct close-ups that helped the audience understand what they were feeling. There expressions on their face made you love them, understand their pain and hoping the relationship would last forever. The setting also helped you to understand their isolation. Often their talks were in beautiful settings, alone with nobody around. The theme of this movie identified the need we all have to be understood and have people that truly care about our success. The relationship they built was based on a true friendship that could not be altered by influence from the outside. I can only imagine how good the world could be if we all could find the person who brought out the best in us.

    This film is underrated, but being underrated can be a good thing because it might mean that behind the low rating hides a movie that isn't given the deserved credit. Here's a prime example of that. 'The Man Without a Face' is a funny, human, sensitive, touching and harsh movie. It is a lesson of life and it deals a lot with life's problems and serious stuff. Besides, there is also a lot of comedy, which is a surprise for such a serious film. But the combination of these different elements is effective. Mel Gibson is someone I tend to find overrated, as an actor and as a director. But with 'The Man Without a Face' he made a great movie and proved that after all he is worth something as a director and as an actor, thanks to his great acting as Justin McLeod. Nick Stahl is brilliant as Chuck Norstadt. I love his acting, he really convinces in whatever he does in this movie, he's truly that expressive. Chuck is so funny: his hilarious lines, his strong personality, his devilish sense of humor and the extremely goofy facial expressions he does when he is completely "in the moon". He is also very inquisitive, determined and stubborn, It's also funny that, although he is 14 years old, his face is very childish, making him look much younger than he is. However, Chuck is also a troubled and enraged boy. I can't blame him: with a father like he had, a mother like that and an older half-sister like that, no wonder he is a little crazy. Only his younger half-sister is decent. The film can also count with the help of a nice soundtrack (with soft instrumental music and a great oldie song - "Born a Woman" by Sandy Posey), as well as the simple fact that it takes place in Maine - which means it has beautiful vistas, all natural. It is also worth for the old cars and those acquaintanceships in family and with neighbors and friends. Like I said before, this movie is a lesson of life. You can actually learn a lot from it. It's interesting what is possible to learn from it. Title in Portugal: 'Um Homem Sem Rosto'.

    This was a well acted movie, nothing to grandeur to be sure but interesting enough. The film has a boy who actually wants to go to a boarding school which is kind of a nice change of pace, but he does not really have the grades to do so. Well lucky for him there is a recluse living nearby, and he just happens to be a teacher. Well he tries to get this guy's help, but the guy is rather hesitant to do so. He is disfigured thanks to an incident in the past and he is frowned upon by the community. He does take the boy in though as you knew he would have to do seeing as there would not be much of a movie if he did not and the two form a bit of a bond. Not really a big one where the guy makes up for the fact the boy is fatherless, but a student teacher one to be sure. Well something happens and the boy is caught at this mans house by some authorities and there is a big court scene and we learn why the man has lost half his face and why he is frowned upon by the community. Usually I would say this movie is trying to say people unjustly accuse people of things based on appearances and such, but it just does not work in this case as there was sufficient evidence and circumstances to believe the man could have done what he was accused of. Still, Mel Gibson turns in a good performance and it was somewhat entertaining to watch, just nothing that would top any favorite movie lists of mine.

    I first watched this film as a child. My imagination was immediately engrossed, and it hasn't since recovered. McLeod was a commanding figure to me. I related to Chuck on almost every level. I think McLeod's character was very well done. I think the story was standard, but that it was the atmosphere and the characters which carried the movie. What I loved most was McLeod's home and yard. The house is filled with nautical themes, books, and various antique collector items. There is an art studio, since he paints for Time Magazine. You hear the constant noise of falling waves and sea-gulls overhead. There is a blue lake in his back yard about an acre from the house, which itself is hugged by green trees in the front and the sides. But he is lonely. His only company is a German Shepherd named Mickey. He's alone because of his painful past. The reason he is 'without a face' is because he has burns over half his body from a car crash in which a boy was killed. The event was surrounded by controversy. People thought McLeod and the boy were having a sexual relationship of sorts, but the charges were dropped. McLeod was deeply hurt by the incident; not only because a boy died who he cared deeply about, but because of everyone's misperceptions and judgmentalism. So, he chooses to live alone in a big house and stay to himself. He preoccupies himself with building a boat, training his dog, reading books, creating models of ships, painting, playing chess, taking care of his horse, and making his usual trip to the grocery store. There is a very touching scene in which McLeod is brooding over his condition. He feels exiled from humanity. He is on a journey, but doesn't know where to go. Dramatic opera plays in the background. He reads the beginning lines of Virgil's Aenied. After reading, he holds a mirror up to his face, placing the edge on his nose, so that only the unscarred part of his face reflects. For a moment, he looks normal; but as he moves the mirror more and more to the left, more and more of the scars are laid bare, and he is disgusted. I think that is such a symbol of the human condition! Chuck is a dreamer, full of hope. His father killed himself in a mental institution; his mother is manipulative; his older half-sister is malicious; his younger half-sister is kind-hearted, but still only a child. He dreams of going to military school! The only problem is that you have to pass the entrance exams. You need to know Latin and some high-level mathematics. He is in need of a teacher. I won't get into all the details. The movie is great because of the growing relationship of McLeod and Chuck. The movie's scenes of their intimacy are truly delicious. For example, McLeod teaches Chuck how to read poetry and perform Shakespeare plays. McLeod takes home the poem 'High Flight' and reads it in his bathroom in a very sublime scene. All in all, a very good movie!

    I had never heard of this movie or the book it was taken from...but I watched it because of Mel Gibson, even though I am not a big fan of his, his movies are usually at least worth a look/see. I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this movie was and the lasting impression it has had on me. Many movies are so forgettable that after watching them they are soon forgotten. I marveled at how well the entire movie was directed and the sets, acting, screenplay were magnificent. The movie is about a young boy who feels different than others in his family and circle of friends. He meets and a strong friendship between the boy and Mel Gibsons character are forged. The movie is about being different and still normal, still with feelings, still with intelligence, still with passion. The only thing in the movie I might change would be the title, it just is not what I would consider a good name....A better choice might be "A Man and a Boy"... or something similar.

    I should perhaps point out that my comments below are based solely upon the film. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I have not read the original novel by Isabelle Holland- indeed, I had never previously heard of either the book or its author. Mel Gibson's first film as director is set during one summer in the late sixties. Charles Norstadt, a twelve-year-old boy, is on holiday with his mother and two half-sisters on an island off the coast of Maine. He has ambitions to attend the same military academy as his late father, who he believes was a war hero, but receives no encouragement from his mother, Catherine, who regards military schools as "fascist" and is firmly convinced that her son is too stupid to pass the entrance examination. Charles makes the acquaintance of Justin McLeod, a painter living in a large house on the island. Because of his reclusive nature, and because his face has been horribly disfigured in an accident, McLeod is treated with a mixture of fear and mockery by his neighbours, particularly the local children. Charles, however, discovers that McLeod was at one time a teacher, and asks him to tutor him for the entrance exam. The gruff, taciturn McLeod is at first reluctant, but he gradually warms to the boy, and a close friendship grows up between them. Charles comes to see him as a father-figure, especially after he makes the unwelcome discovery that his own father was not a war hero but an alcoholic who abandoned his family and later committed suicide. Gibson initially wanted to cast another actor as McLeod, but was eventually persuaded to play the role himself. I think that that was the right decision; I have not seen all his films as an actor, but of the ones I have seen I think that he gave his best performances in this one and in Zeffirelli's "Hamlet". McLeod is a complex character who is more than an innocent victim. He is also haunted by feelings of guilt arising out of the car accident in which he was injured and his passenger, one of his pupils, was killed. It is these guilt feelings which have led to his becoming a recluse and to his refusing to have plastic surgery to correct his disfigurement. His mentoring of Charles can be seen as an attempt to make amends for his past. The young Nick Stahl is also very good as Charles. Gibson has the reputation of being one of Hollywood's more conservative figures, and there are conservative aspects to "The Man without a Face". Although the film is set during the Vietnam War, a time when all things military were regarded with deep suspicion by a large section of American public opinion, Charles' ambition to attend a military academy is presented as a laudable one. The politically liberal Catherine is too wrapped up in her own emotional needs to consider those of her children. She has been married several times (her three children all have different fathers) and many of Charles' emotional problems stem from his unstable family background and the lack of a father-figure in his life. The title "The Man without a Face" can refer to the disfigured McLeod, but it can also refer to Charles' father who is "without a face" in the sense that his son has no mental image of him. In another respect, however, the film can be seen as having a liberal theme, although not in the narrowly political meaning of that word. The local people's distrust of McLeod does not derive solely from his disfigured appearance. He is also rumoured to be a paedophile, and his friendship with Charles is therefore seen by many, including the local police chief, as deeply suspicious. I note that one reviewer actually concludes that McLeod is a paedophile and that another thinks that the film would be more interesting if he were to be portrayed as one. I think both these viewpoints are wrong. It seems quite clear from the film that the relationship between McLeod and Charles is platonic and non-sexual. If it were otherwise McLeod would be a detestable character rather than a pitiable one, and the film's key theme- that of not judging people, particularly those who are in some way different, on the basis of suspicion, rumour and unfounded accusations- would be fatally undermined. Of Gibson's four films as a director I think that "The Man without a Face" is, together with the very different "The Passion of the Christ", the best. It is a well-told human drama, a sensitive exploration of the teacher-pupil relationship and of the corrosive effects of suspicion and prejudice. It is certainly better than the overblown and overrated "Braveheart" for which he won an Oscar. 8/10

    This was truly a heart-warming story; it was a mix of emotions -- sad, cheerful, humorous, and never boring. I can watch this movie a hundred times! Nick Stahl, even at a very young age, was an excellent actor. Every move, every expression added great humor and passion to each scene. At the beginning of the movie, it's fast-paced and energetic, but at the end it's really sad, so you'll need a box of tissue~ I was kind of disappointed at the end because Mel Gibson actually ends up being restrained from seeing Nick Stahl. Very sad. It wasn't lacking any quality at the end, so you cannot stay mad. But overall, you HAVE to watch this movie.

    This is one of my favourite films, Mel Gibson being my favourite actor has proved yet again what he can do with a role. Nick Stahl also does a brilliant job at playing Chuck Norstadt. Mel Gibson also made his Directing debut with this film and made it something special. A beautiful story about Chuck Norstadt (Stahl) who has an urge to get away from his family consisting of his mother (and her many husbands), his younger half sister & his older half sister who he has a bitter feud with. He is seen as a hard learner, this is where Justin McLeod (Gibson) comes in. Chuck in order to get away from his family must pass an exam to get into a Military Academy his father attended. Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck, until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship & judging people under assumptions.

His only company is a German Shepherd named Mickey. He's alone because of his painful past. The reason he is 'without a face' is because he has burns over half his body from a car crash in which a boy was killed. The event was surrounded by controversy. People thought McLeod and the boy were having a sexual relationship of sorts, but the charges were dropped. McLeod was deeply hurt by the incident; not only because a boy died who he cared deeply about, but because of everyone's misperceptions and judgmentalism. So, he chooses to live alone in a big house and stay to himself. He preoccupies himself with building a boat, training his dog, reading books, creating models of ships, painting, playing chess, taking care of his horse, and making his usual trip to the grocery store. There is a very touching scene in which McLeod is brooding over his condition. He feels exiled from humanity. He is on a journey, but doesn't know where to go. Dramatic opera plays in the background. He reads the beginning lines of Virgil's Aenied. After reading, he holds a mirror up to his face, placing the edge on his nose, so that only the unscarred part of his face reflects. For a moment, he looks normal; but as he moves the mirror more and more to the left, more and more of the scars are laid bare, and he is disgusted. I think that is such a symbol of the human condition! Chuck is a dreamer, full of hope. His father killed himself in a mental institution; his mother is manipulative; his older half-sister is malicious; his younger half-sister is kind-hearted, but still only a child. He dreams of going to military school! The only problem is that you have to pass the entrance exams. You need to know Latin and some high-level mathematics. He is in need of a teacher. I won't get into all the details. The movie is great because of the growing relationship of McLeod and Chuck. The movie's scenes of their intimacy are truly delicious. For example, McLeod teaches Chuck how to read poetry and perform Shakespeare plays. McLeod takes home the poem 'High Flight' and reads it in his bathroom in a very sublime scene. All in all, a very good movie!

    I had never heard of this movie or the book it was taken from...but I watched it because of Mel Gibson, even though I am not a big fan of his, his movies are usually at least worth a look/see. I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this movie was and the lasting impression it has had on me. Many movies are so forgettable that after watching them they are soon forgotten. I marveled at how well the entire movie was directed and the sets, acting, screenplay were magnificent. The movie is about a young boy who feels different than others in his family and circle of friends. He meets and a strong friendship between the boy and Mel Gibsons character are forged. The movie is about being different and still normal, still with feelings, still with intelligence, still with passion. The only thing in the movie I might change would be the title, it just is not what I would consider a good name....A better choice might be "A Man and a Boy"... or something similar.

    I should perhaps point out that my comments below are based solely upon the film. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I have not read the original novel by Isabelle Holland- indeed, I had never previously heard of either the book or its author. Mel Gibson's first film as director is set during one summer in the late sixties. Charles Norstadt, a twelve-year-old boy, is on holiday with his mother and two half-sisters on an island off the coast of Maine. He has ambitions to attend the same military academy as his late father, who he believes was a war hero, but receives no encouragement from his mother, Catherine, who regards military schools as "fascist" and is firmly convinced that her son is too stupid to pass the entrance examination. Charles makes the acquaintance of Justin McLeod, a painter living in a large house on the island. Because of his reclusive nature, and because his face has been horribly disfigured in an accident, McLeod is treated with a mixture of fear and mockery by his neighbours, particularly the local children. Charles, however, discovers that McLeod was at one time a teacher, and asks him to tutor him for the entrance exam. The gruff, taciturn McLeod is at first reluctant, but he gradually warms to the boy, and a close friendship grows up between them. Charles comes to see him as a father-figure, especially after he makes the unwelcome discovery that his own father was not a war hero but an alcoholic who abandoned his family and later committed suicide. Gibson initially wanted to cast another actor as McLeod, but was eventually persuaded to play the role himself. I think that that was the right decision; I have not seen all his films as an actor, but of the ones I have seen I think that he gave his best performances in this one and in Zeffirelli's "Hamlet". McLeod is a complex character who is more than an innocent victim. He is also haunted by feelings of guilt arising out of the car accident in which he was injured and his passenger, one of his pupils, was killed. It is these guilt feelings which have led to his becoming a recluse and to his refusing to have plastic surgery to correct his disfigurement. His mentoring of Charles can be seen as an attempt to make amends for his past. The young Nick Stahl is also very good as Charles. Gibson has the reputation of being one of Hollywood's more conservative figures, and there are conservative aspects to "The Man without a Face". Although the film is set during the Vietnam War, a time when all things military were regarded with deep suspicion by a large section of American public opinion, Charles' ambition to attend a military academy is presented as a laudable one. The politically liberal Catherine is too wrapped up in her own emotional needs to consider those of her children. She has been married several times (her three children all have different fathers) and many of Charles' emotional problems stem from his unstable family background and the lack of a father-figure in his life. The title "The Man without a Face" can refer to the disfigured McLeod, but it can also refer to Charles' father who is "without a face" in the sense that his son has no mental image of him. In another respect, however, the film can be seen as having a liberal theme, although not in the narrowly political meaning of that word. The local people's distrust of McLeod does not derive solely from his disfigured appearance. He is also rumoured to be a paedophile, and his friendship with Charles is therefore seen by many, including the local police chief, as deeply suspicious. I note that one reviewer actually concludes that McLeod is a paedophile and that another thinks that the film would be more interesting if he were to be portrayed as one. I think both these viewpoints are wrong. It seems quite clear from the film that the relationship between McLeod and Charles is platonic and non-sexual. If it were otherwise McLeod would be a detestable character rather than a pitiable one, and the film's key theme- that of not judging people, particularly those who are in some way different, on the basis of suspicion, rumour and unfounded accusations- would be fatally undermined. Of Gibson's four films as a director I think that "The Man without a Face" is, together with the very different "The Passion of the Christ", the best. It is a well-told human drama, a sensitive exploration of the teacher-pupil relationship and of the corrosive effects of suspicion and prejudice. It is certainly better than the overblown and overrated "Braveheart" for which he won an Oscar. 8/10

    This was truly a heart-warming story; it was a mix of emotions -- sad, cheerful, humorous, and never boring. I can watch this movie a hundred times! Nick Stahl, even at a very young age, was an excellent actor. Every move, every expression added great humor and passion to each scene. At the beginning of the movie, it's fast-paced and energetic, but at the end it's really sad, so you'll need a box of tissue~ I was kind of disappointed at the end because Mel Gibson actually ends up being restrained from seeing Nick Stahl. Very sad. It wasn't lacking any quality at the end, so you cannot stay mad. But overall, you HAVE to watch this movie.

    This is one of my favourite films, Mel Gibson being my favourite actor has proved yet again what he can do with a role. Nick Stahl also does a brilliant job at playing Chuck Norstadt. Mel Gibson also made his Directing debut with this film and made it something special. A beautiful story about Chuck Norstadt (Stahl) who has an urge to get away from his family consisting of his mother (and her many husbands), his younger half sister & his older half sister who he has a bitter feud with. He is seen as a hard learner, this is where Justin McLeod (Gibson) comes in. Chuck in order to get away from his family must pass an exam to get into a Military Academy his father attended. Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck, until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship & judging people under assumptions.

    Mel Gibson both directs and stars in this moving film as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher who was partially disfigured in a car accident ten years previous, and where a student was incinerated. Ever since, he has lived on the edge of town, an object of fear and ridicule, until one young man named Charles 'Chuck' Norstadt(Nick Stahl) befriends him with the aim of being tutored by him, since his grades need improvement, and Chuck is not afraid. However, his family is still suspicious, and Chuck will uncover the truth about McLeod that will change their lives forever. Mel Gibson does a fine job directing and acting, building a believable portrait of this scarred man who needs a second chance from a society that has wrongly judged him, and a young boy who will have his life turned around, leading to a most fitting finale.

    I've not seen more than a handful of Mel's movies. Certainly all the violent money makers, but last night, I watched "TMWaF". I am not a movie critic and don't know how to critique movies, but this movie, I loved from beginning to end. Every actor played their role (large or small) so well it was like I lived in the town and was watching everyday life. I won't go on and on. I recommend the movie to all, even those hooked on the latest zombie movies or those youngsters who crave violent action flicks. Take some time out, watch this one and prepare to see a movie that will keep you thinking. A movie that shows what MOVIES can be. BTW I was left with a question: did all the town shun and despise Justin McLeod? I would have thought at least some of the women would have felt sorry for him seeing the undamaged half of his face and seeing how he would have been the handsomest man any of them could have known and just wondering "ah, what could have been".

    The movie I reviewed was The Man without a Face starring Mel Gibson as Justin McLeod and newcomer Nick Stahl as Chuck Norstad. The movie was set in scenic upper class neighborhood in Cranesport Maine. The movie focuses on a twelve year old boy, Chuck, who has experienced a difficult childhood, never knowing what really happened to his dad, and a mother that was more interested in finding a new husband than raising her son. Chuck's dream was to get into military school but unfortunately he was unable to pass the entrance exam. Through circumstances, he ran into Justin McLeod a passed educator that was disfigured in a car accident that killed one of his students. Because of his close relationship with his past student, it was implied that his relationship may have been improper so he gave up teaching and lived in isolation. The theme of this movie was based on the relationship between Chuck, a struggling youth without a father figure and a teacher who truly cared about educating his students. As their relationship builds to a true friendship through relentless hours of studying and practice test, Chuck prepares for the entrance exam. Eventually rumors in the small community began to swirl, and once again the relationship he has with his student is again in question. While there is no merit to these accusations, it is deemed by the authorities that they should no longer have contact with one another. Chuck goes on to be successful and graduate military school while Justin McLeod stands in the background demonstrating his undying support for his friend. To develop the theme, there are several scenes that demonstrate Chuck's troubled upbringing, through fights with his sister and a lack of assistance from his mother. While other scenes show the town talking about Mr. McLeod and the circumstances that disfigured his face. All of these scenes helped to isolate each of these individuals leading them only to lean on each other. A movie with a similar theme was Gran Torino. While the movie was not based necessarily on a relationship, it focused on an individual and a group of people that their nationality that did not fit in to current society. The two relied on each other and carried each other through the difficult time. The director chose various techniques to demonstrate the relationship between the two friends. First, the camera angles were direct close-ups that helped the audience understand what they were feeling. There expressions on their face made you love them, understand their pain and hoping the relationship would last forever. The setting also helped you to understand their isolation. Often their talks were in beautiful settings, alone with nobody around. The theme of this movie identified the need we all have to be understood and have people that truly care about our success. The relationship they built was based on a true friendship that could not be altered by influence from the outside. I can only imagine how good the world could be if we all could find the person who brought out the best in us.

    This film is underrated, but being underrated can be a good thing because it might mean that behind the low rating hides a movie that isn't given the deserved credit. Here's a prime example of that. 'The Man Without a Face' is a funny, human, sensitive, touching and harsh movie. It is a lesson of life and it deals a lot with life's problems and serious stuff. Besides, there is also a lot of comedy, which is a surprise for such a serious film. But the combination of these different elements is effective. Mel Gibson is someone I tend to find overrated, as an actor and as a director. But with 'The Man Without a Face' he made a great movie and proved that after all he is worth something as a director and as an actor, thanks to his great acting as Justin McLeod. Nick Stahl is brilliant as Chuck Norstadt. I love his acting, he really convinces in whatever he does in this movie, he's truly that expressive. Chuck is so funny: his hilarious lines, his strong personality, his devilish sense of humor and the extremely goofy facial expressions he does when he is completely "in the moon". He is also very inquisitive, determined and stubborn, It's also funny that, although he is 14 years old, his face is very childish, making him look much younger than he is. However, Chuck is also a troubled and enraged boy. I can't blame him: with a father like he had, a mother like that and an older half-sister like that, no wonder he is a little crazy. Only his younger half-sister is decent. The film can also count with the help of a nice soundtrack (with soft instrumental music and a great oldie song - "Born a Woman" by Sandy Posey), as well as the simple fact that it takes place in Maine - which means it has beautiful vistas, all natural. It is also worth for the old cars and those acquaintanceships in family and with neighbors and friends. Like I said before, this movie is a lesson of life. You can actually learn a lot from it. It's interesting what is possible to learn from it. Title in Portugal: 'Um Homem Sem Rosto'.

    This was a well acted movie, nothing to grandeur to be sure but interesting enough. The film has a boy who actually wants to go to a boarding school which is kind of a nice change of pace, but he does not really have the grades to do so. Well lucky for him there is a recluse living nearby, and he just happens to be a teacher. Well he tries to get this guy's help, but the guy is rather hesitant to do so. He is disfigured thanks to an incident in the past and he is frowned upon by the community. He does take the boy in though as you knew he would have to do seeing as there would not be much of a movie if he did not and the two form a bit of a bond. Not really a big one where the guy makes up for the fact the boy is fatherless, but a student teacher one to be sure. Well something happens and the boy is caught at this mans house by some authorities and there is a big court scene and we learn why the man has lost half his face and why he is frowned upon by the community. Usually I would say this movie is trying to say people unjustly accuse people of things based on appearances and such, but it just does not work in this case as there was sufficient evidence and circumstances to believe the man could have done what he was accused of. Still, Mel Gibson turns in a good performance and it was somewhat entertaining to watch, just nothing that would top any favorite movie lists of mine.

    I first watched this film as a child. My imagination was immediately engrossed, and it hasn't since recovered. McLeod was a commanding figure to me. I related to Chuck on almost every level. I think McLeod's character was very well done. I think the story was standard, but that it was the atmosphere and the characters which carried the movie. What I loved most was McLeod's home and yard. The house is filled with nautical themes, books, and various antique collector items. There is an art studio, since he paints for Time Magazine. You hear the constant noise of falling waves and sea-gulls overhead. There is a blue lake in his back yard about an acre from the house, which itself is hugged by green trees in the front and the sides. But he is lonely. His only company is a German Shepherd named Mickey. He's alone because of his painful past. The reason he is 'without a face' is because he has burns over half his body from a car crash in which a boy was killed. The event was surrounded by controversy. People thought McLeod and the boy were having a sexual relationship of sorts, but the charges were dropped. McLeod was deeply hurt by the incident; not only because a boy died who he cared deeply about, but because of everyone's misperceptions and judgmentalism. So, he chooses to live alone in a big house and stay to himself. He preoccupies himself with building a boat, training his dog, reading books, creating models of ships, painting, playing chess, taking care of his horse, and making his usual trip to the grocery store. There is a very touching scene in which McLeod is brooding over his condition. He feels exiled from humanity. He is on a journey, but doesn't know where to go. Dramatic opera plays in the background.

For example, McLeod teaches Chuck how to read poetry and perform Shakespeare plays. McLeod takes home the poem 'High Flight' and reads it in his bathroom in a very sublime scene. All in all, a very good movie!

Mel Gibson does a fine job directing and acting, building a believable portrait of this scarred man who needs a second chance from a society that has wrongly judged him, and a young boy who will have his life turned around, leading to a most fitting finale.

    I've not seen more than a handful of Mel's movies. Certainly all the violent money makers, but last night, I watched "TMWaF". I am not a movie critic and don't know how to critique movies, but this movie, I loved from beginning to end. Every actor played their role (large or small) so well it was like I lived in the town and was watching everyday life. I won't go on and on. I recommend the movie to all, even those hooked on the latest zombie movies or those youngsters who crave violent action flicks. Take some time out, watch this one and prepare to see a movie that will keep you thinking. A movie that shows what MOVIES can be. BTW I was left with a question: did all the town shun and despise Justin McLeod? I would have thought at least some of the women would have felt sorry for him seeing the undamaged half of his face and seeing how he would have been the handsomest man any of them could have known and just wondering "ah, what could have been".

    The movie I reviewed was The Man without a Face starring Mel Gibson as Justin McLeod and newcomer Nick Stahl as Chuck Norstad. The movie was set in scenic upper class neighborhood in Cranesport Maine. The movie focuses on a twelve year old boy, Chuck, who has experienced a difficult childhood, never knowing what really happened to his dad, and a mother that was more interested in finding a new husband than raising her son. Chuck's dream was to get into military school but unfortunately he was unable to pass the entrance exam. Through circumstances, he ran into Justin McLeod a passed educator that was disfigured in a car accident that killed one of his students. Because of his close relationship with his past student, it was implied that his relationship may have been improper so he gave up teaching and lived in isolation. The theme of this movie was based on the relationship between Chuck, a struggling youth without a father figure and a teacher who truly cared about educating his students. As their relationship builds to a true friendship through relentless hours of studying and practice test, Chuck prepares for the entrance exam. Eventually rumors in the small community began to swirl, and once again the relationship he has with his student is again in question. While there is no merit to these accusations, it is deemed by the authorities that they should no longer have contact with one another. Chuck goes on to be successful and graduate military school while Justin McLeod stands in the background demonstrating his undying support for his friend. To develop the theme, there are several scenes that demonstrate Chuck's troubled upbringing, through fights with his sister and a lack of assistance from his mother. While other scenes show the town talking about Mr. McLeod and the circumstances that disfigured his face. All of these scenes helped to isolate each of these individuals leading them only to lean on each other. A movie with a similar theme was Gran Torino. While the movie was not based necessarily on a relationship, it focused on an individual and a group of people that their nationality that did not fit in to current society. The two relied on each other and carried each other through the difficult time. The director chose various techniques to demonstrate the relationship between the two friends. First, the camera angles were direct close-ups that helped the audience understand what they were feeling. There expressions on their face made you love them, understand their pain and hoping the relationship would last forever. The setting also helped you to understand their isolation. Often their talks were in beautiful settings, alone with nobody around. The theme of this movie identified the need we all have to be understood and have people that truly care about our success. The relationship they built was based on a true friendship that could not be altered by influence from the outside. I can only imagine how good the world could be if we all could find the person who brought out the best in us.

    This film is underrated, but being underrated can be a good thing because it might mean that behind the low rating hides a movie that isn't given the deserved credit. Here's a prime example of that. 'The Man Without a Face' is a funny, human, sensitive, touching and harsh movie. It is a lesson of life and it deals a lot with life's problems and serious stuff. Besides, there is also a lot of comedy, which is a surprise for such a serious film. But the combination of these different elements is effective. Mel Gibson is someone I tend to find overrated, as an actor and as a director. But with 'The Man Without a Face' he made a great movie and proved that after all he is worth something as a director and as an actor, thanks to his great acting as Justin McLeod. Nick Stahl is brilliant as Chuck Norstadt. I love his acting, he really convinces in whatever he does in this movie, he's truly that expressive. Chuck is so funny: his hilarious lines, his strong personality, his devilish sense of humor and the extremely goofy facial expressions he does when he is completely "in the moon". He is also very inquisitive, determined and stubborn, It's also funny that, although he is 14 years old, his face is very childish, making him look much younger than he is. However, Chuck is also a troubled and enraged boy. I can't blame him: with a father like he had, a mother like that and an older half-sister like that, no wonder he is a little crazy. Only his younger half-sister is decent. The film can also count with the help of a nice soundtrack (with soft instrumental music and a great oldie song - "Born a Woman" by Sandy Posey), as well as the simple fact that it takes place in Maine - which means it has beautiful vistas, all natural. It is also worth for the old cars and those acquaintanceships in family and with neighbors and friends. Like I said before, this movie is a lesson of life. You can actually learn a lot from it. It's interesting what is possible to learn from it. Title in Portugal: 'Um Homem Sem Rosto'.

    This was a well acted movie, nothing to grandeur to be sure but interesting enough. The film has a boy who actually wants to go to a boarding school which is kind of a nice change of pace, but he does not really have the grades to do so. Well lucky for him there is a recluse living nearby, and he just happens to be a teacher. Well he tries to get this guy's help, but the guy is rather hesitant to do so. He is disfigured thanks to an incident in the past and he is frowned upon by the community. He does take the boy in though as you knew he would have to do seeing as there would not be much of a movie if he did not and the two form a bit of a bond. Not really a big one where the guy makes up for the fact the boy is fatherless, but a student teacher one to be sure. Well something happens and the boy is caught at this mans house by some authorities and there is a big court scene and we learn why the man has lost half his face and why he is frowned upon by the community. Usually I would say this movie is trying to say people unjustly accuse people of things based on appearances and such, but it just does not work in this case as there was sufficient evidence and circumstances to believe the man could have done what he was accused of. Still, Mel Gibson turns in a good performance and it was somewhat entertaining to watch, just nothing that would top any favorite movie lists of mine.

    I first watched this film as a child. My imagination was immediately engrossed, and it hasn't since recovered. McLeod was a commanding figure to me. I related to Chuck on almost every level. I think McLeod's character was very well done. I think the story was standard, but that it was the atmosphere and the characters which carried the movie. What I loved most was McLeod's home and yard. The house is filled with nautical themes, books, and various antique collector items. There is an art studio, since he paints for Time Magazine. You hear the constant noise of falling waves and sea-gulls overhead. There is a blue lake in his back yard about an acre from the house, which itself is hugged by green trees in the front and the sides. But he is lonely. His only company is a German Shepherd named Mickey. He's alone because of his painful past. The reason he is 'without a face' is because he has burns over half his body from a car crash in which a boy was killed. The event was surrounded by controversy. People thought McLeod and the boy were having a sexual relationship of sorts, but the charges were dropped. McLeod was deeply hurt by the incident; not only because a boy died who he cared deeply about, but because of everyone's misperceptions and judgmentalism. So, he chooses to live alone in a big house and stay to himself. He preoccupies himself with building a boat, training his dog, reading books, creating models of ships, painting, playing chess, taking care of his horse, and making his usual trip to the grocery store. There is a very touching scene in which McLeod is brooding over his condition. He feels exiled from humanity. He is on a journey, but doesn't know where to go. Dramatic opera plays in the background. He reads the beginning lines of Virgil's Aenied. After reading, he holds a mirror up to his face, placing the edge on his nose, so that only the unscarred part of his face reflects. For a moment, he looks normal; but as he moves the mirror more and more to the left, more and more of the scars are laid bare, and he is disgusted. I think that is such a symbol of the human condition! Chuck is a dreamer, full of hope. His father killed himself in a mental institution; his mother is manipulative; his older half-sister is malicious; his younger half-sister is kind-hearted, but still only a child. He dreams of going to military school! The only problem is that you have to pass the entrance exams. You need to know Latin and some high-level mathematics. He is in need of a teacher. I won't get into all the details. The movie is great because of the growing relationship of McLeod and Chuck. The movie's scenes of their intimacy are truly delicious. For example, McLeod teaches Chuck how to read poetry and perform Shakespeare plays. McLeod takes home the poem 'High Flight' and reads it in his bathroom in a very sublime scene. All in all, a very good movie!

    I had never heard of this movie or the book it was taken from...but I watched it because of Mel Gibson, even though I am not a big fan of his, his movies are usually at least worth a look/see. I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this movie was and the lasting impression it has had on me. Many movies are so forgettable that after watching them they are soon forgotten. I marveled at how well the entire movie was directed and the sets, acting, screenplay were magnificent. The movie is about a young boy who feels different than others in his family and circle of friends. He meets and a strong friendship between the boy and Mel Gibsons character are forged. The movie is about being different and still normal, still with feelings, still with intelligence, still with passion. The only thing in the movie I might change would be the title, it just is not what I would consider a good name....A better choice might be "A Man and a Boy"... or something similar.

    I should perhaps point out that my comments below are based solely upon the film. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I have not read the original novel by Isabelle Holland- indeed, I had never previously heard of either the book or its author. Mel Gibson's first film as director is set during one summer in the late sixties. Charles Norstadt, a twelve-year-old boy, is on holiday with his mother and two half-sisters on an island off the coast of Maine. He has ambitions to attend the same military academy as his late father, who he believes was a war hero, but receives no encouragement from his mother, Catherine, who regards military schools as "fascist" and is firmly convinced that her son is too stupid to pass the entrance examination. Charles makes the acquaintance of Justin McLeod, a painter living in a large house on the island. Because of his reclusive nature, and because his face has been horribly disfigured in an accident, McLeod is treated with a mixture of fear and mockery by his neighbours, particularly the local children. Charles, however, discovers that McLeod was at one time a teacher, and asks him to tutor him for the entrance exam. The gruff, taciturn McLeod is at first reluctant, but he gradually warms to the boy, and a close friendship grows up between them. Charles comes to see him as a father-figure, especially after he makes the unwelcome discovery that his own father was not a war hero but an alcoholic who abandoned his family and later committed suicide. Gibson initially wanted to cast another actor as McLeod, but was eventually persuaded to play the role himself. I think that that was the right decision; I have not seen all his films as an actor, but of the ones I have seen I think that he gave his best performances in this one and in Zeffirelli's "Hamlet". McLeod is a complex character who is more than an innocent victim. He is also haunted by feelings of guilt arising out of the car accident in which he was injured and his passenger, one of his pupils, was killed. It is these guilt feelings which have led to his becoming a recluse and to his refusing to have plastic surgery to correct his disfigurement. His mentoring of Charles can be seen as an attempt to make amends for his past. The young Nick Stahl is also very good as Charles. Gibson has the reputation of being one of Hollywood's more conservative figures, and there are conservative aspects to "The Man without a Face". Although the film is set during the Vietnam War, a time when all things military were regarded with deep suspicion by a large section of American public opinion, Charles' ambition to attend a military academy is presented as a laudable one. The politically liberal Catherine is too wrapped up in her own emotional needs to consider those of her children. She has been married several times (her three children all have different fathers) and many of Charles' emotional problems stem from his unstable family background and the lack of a father-figure in his life. The title "The Man without a Face" can refer to the disfigured McLeod, but it can also refer to Charles' father who is "without a face" in the sense that his son has no mental image of him. In another respect, however, the film can be seen as having a liberal theme, although not in the narrowly political meaning of that word. The local people's distrust of McLeod does not derive solely from his disfigured appearance. He is also rumoured to be a paedophile, and his friendship with Charles is therefore seen by many, including the local police chief, as deeply suspicious. I note that one reviewer actually concludes that McLeod is a paedophile and that another thinks that the film would be more interesting if he were to be portrayed as one. I think both these viewpoints are wrong. It seems quite clear from the film that the relationship between McLeod and Charles is platonic and non-sexual. If it were otherwise McLeod would be a detestable character rather than a pitiable one, and the film's key theme- that of not judging people, particularly those who are in some way different, on the basis of suspicion, rumour and unfounded accusations- would be fatally undermined. Of Gibson's four films as a director I think that "The Man without a Face" is, together with the very different "The Passion of the Christ", the best. It is a well-told human drama, a sensitive exploration of the teacher-pupil relationship and of the corrosive effects of suspicion and prejudice. It is certainly better than the overblown and overrated "Braveheart" for which he won an Oscar. 8/10

    This was truly a heart-warming story; it was a mix of emotions -- sad, cheerful, humorous, and never boring. I can watch this movie a hundred times! Nick Stahl, even at a very young age, was an excellent actor. Every move, every expression added great humor and passion to each scene. At the beginning of the movie, it's fast-paced and energetic, but at the end it's really sad, so you'll need a box of tissue~ I was kind of disappointed at the end because Mel Gibson actually ends up being restrained from seeing Nick Stahl. Very sad. It wasn't lacking any quality at the end, so you cannot stay mad. But overall, you HAVE to watch this movie.

    This is one of my favourite films, Mel Gibson being my favourite actor has proved yet again what he can do with a role. Nick Stahl also does a brilliant job at playing Chuck Norstadt. Mel Gibson also made his Directing debut with this film and made it something special. A beautiful story about Chuck Norstadt (Stahl) who has an urge to get away from his family consisting of his mother (and her many husbands), his younger half sister & his older half sister who he has a bitter feud with. He is seen as a hard learner, this is where Justin McLeod (Gibson) comes in. Chuck in order to get away from his family must pass an exam to get into a Military Academy his father attended. Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck, until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship & judging people under assumptions.

    Mel Gibson both directs and stars in this moving film as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher who was partially disfigured in a car accident ten years previous, and where a student was incinerated. Ever since, he has lived on the edge of town, an object of fear and ridicule, until one young man named Charles 'Chuck' Norstadt(Nick Stahl) befriends him with the aim of being tutored by him, since his grades need improvement, and Chuck is not afraid. However, his family is still suspicious, and Chuck will uncover the truth about McLeod that will change their lives forever. Mel Gibson does a fine job directing and acting, building a believable portrait of this scarred man who needs a second chance from a society that has wrongly judged him, and a young boy who will have his life turned around, leading to a most fitting finale.

He dreams of going to military school! The only problem is that you have to pass the entrance exams. You need to know Latin and some high-level mathematics. He is in need of a teacher. I won't get into all the details. The movie is great because of the growing relationship of McLeod and Chuck. The movie's scenes of their intimacy are truly delicious. For example, McLeod teaches Chuck how to read poetry and perform Shakespeare plays. McLeod takes home the poem 'High Flight' and reads it in his bathroom in a very sublime scene. All in all, a very good movie!

    I had never heard of this movie or the book it was taken from...but I watched it because of Mel Gibson, even though I am not a big fan of his, his movies are usually at least worth a look/see. I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this movie was and the lasting impression it has had on me. Many movies are so forgettable that after watching them they are soon forgotten. I marveled at how well the entire movie was directed and the sets, acting, screenplay were magnificent. The movie is about a young boy who feels different than others in his family and circle of friends. He meets and a strong friendship between the boy and Mel Gibsons character are forged. The movie is about being different and still normal, still with feelings, still with intelligence, still with passion. The only thing in the movie I might change would be the title, it just is not what I would consider a good name....A better choice might be "A Man and a Boy"... or something similar.

    I should perhaps point out that my comments below are based solely upon the film. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I have not read the original novel by Isabelle Holland- indeed, I had never previously heard of either the book or its author. Mel Gibson's first film as director is set during one summer in the late sixties. Charles Norstadt, a twelve-year-old boy, is on holiday with his mother and two half-sisters on an island off the coast of Maine. He has ambitions to attend the same military academy as his late father, who he believes was a war hero, but receives no encouragement from his mother, Catherine, who regards military schools as "fascist" and is firmly convinced that her son is too stupid to pass the entrance examination. Charles makes the acquaintance of Justin McLeod, a painter living in a large house on the island. Because of his reclusive nature, and because his face has been horribly disfigured in an accident, McLeod is treated with a mixture of fear and mockery by his neighbours, particularly the local children. Charles, however, discovers that McLeod was at one time a teacher, and asks him to tutor him for the entrance exam. The gruff, taciturn McLeod is at first reluctant, but he gradually warms to the boy, and a close friendship grows up between them. Charles comes to see him as a father-figure, especially after he makes the unwelcome discovery that his own father was not a war hero but an alcoholic who abandoned his family and later committed suicide. Gibson initially wanted to cast another actor as McLeod, but was eventually persuaded to play the role himself. I think that that was the right decision; I have not seen all his films as an actor, but of the ones I have seen I think that he gave his best performances in this one and in Zeffirelli's "Hamlet". McLeod is a complex character who is more than an innocent victim. He is also haunted by feelings of guilt arising out of the car accident in which he was injured and his passenger, one of his pupils, was killed. It is these guilt feelings which have led to his becoming a recluse and to his refusing to have plastic surgery to correct his disfigurement. His mentoring of Charles can be seen as an attempt to make amends for his past. The young Nick Stahl is also very good as Charles. Gibson has the reputation of being one of Hollywood's more conservative figures, and there are conservative aspects to "The Man without a Face". Although the film is set during the Vietnam War, a time when all things military were regarded with deep suspicion by a large section of American public opinion, Charles' ambition to attend a military academy is presented as a laudable one. The politically liberal Catherine is too wrapped up in her own emotional needs to consider those of her children. She has been married several times (her three children all have different fathers) and many of Charles' emotional problems stem from his unstable family background and the lack of a father-figure in his life. The title "The Man without a Face" can refer to the disfigured McLeod, but it can also refer to Charles' father who is "without a face" in the sense that his son has no mental image of him. In another respect, however, the film can be seen as having a liberal theme, although not in the narrowly political meaning of that word. The local people's distrust of McLeod does not derive solely from his disfigured appearance. He is also rumoured to be a paedophile, and his friendship with Charles is therefore seen by many, including the local police chief, as deeply suspicious. I note that one reviewer actually concludes that McLeod is a paedophile and that another thinks that the film would be more interesting if he were to be portrayed as one. I think both these viewpoints are wrong. It seems quite clear from the film that the relationship between McLeod and Charles is platonic and non-sexual. If it were otherwise McLeod would be a detestable character rather than a pitiable one, and the film's key theme- that of not judging people, particularly those who are in some way different, on the basis of suspicion, rumour and unfounded accusations- would be fatally undermined. Of Gibson's four films as a director I think that "The Man without a Face" is, together with the very different "The Passion of the Christ", the best. It is a well-told human drama, a sensitive exploration of the teacher-pupil relationship and of the corrosive effects of suspicion and prejudice. It is certainly better than the overblown and overrated "Braveheart" for which he won an Oscar. 8/10

    This was truly a heart-warming story; it was a mix of emotions -- sad, cheerful, humorous, and never boring. I can watch this movie a hundred times! Nick Stahl, even at a very young age, was an excellent actor. Every move, every expression added great humor and passion to each scene. At the beginning of the movie, it's fast-paced and energetic, but at the end it's really sad, so you'll need a box of tissue~ I was kind of disappointed at the end because Mel Gibson actually ends up being restrained from seeing Nick Stahl. Very sad. It wasn't lacking any quality at the end, so you cannot stay mad. But overall, you HAVE to watch this movie.

    This is one of my favourite films, Mel Gibson being my favourite actor has proved yet again what he can do with a role. Nick Stahl also does a brilliant job at playing Chuck Norstadt. Mel Gibson also made his Directing debut with this film and made it something special. A beautiful story about Chuck Norstadt (Stahl) who has an urge to get away from his family consisting of his mother (and her many husbands), his younger half sister & his older half sister who he has a bitter feud with. He is seen as a hard learner, this is where Justin McLeod (Gibson) comes in. Chuck in order to get away from his family must pass an exam to get into a Military Academy his father attended. Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck, until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship & judging people under assumptions.

    Mel Gibson both directs and stars in this moving film as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher who was partially disfigured in a car accident ten years previous, and where a student was incinerated. Ever since, he has lived on the edge of town, an object of fear and ridicule, until one young man named Charles 'Chuck' Norstadt(Nick Stahl) befriends him with the aim of being tutored by him, since his grades need improvement, and Chuck is not afraid. However, his family is still suspicious, and Chuck will uncover the truth about McLeod that will change their lives forever. Mel Gibson does a fine job directing and acting, building a believable portrait of this scarred man who needs a second chance from a society that has wrongly judged him, and a young boy who will have his life turned around, leading to a most fitting finale.

    I've not seen more than a handful of Mel's movies. Certainly all the violent money makers, but last night, I watched "TMWaF". I am not a movie critic and don't know how to critique movies, but this movie, I loved from beginning to end. Every actor played their role (large or small) so well it was like I lived in the town and was watching everyday life. I won't go on and on. I recommend the movie to all, even those hooked on the latest zombie movies or those youngsters who crave violent action flicks. Take some time out, watch this one and prepare to see a movie that will keep you thinking. A movie that shows what MOVIES can be. BTW I was left with a question: did all the town shun and despise Justin McLeod? I would have thought at least some of the women would have felt sorry for him seeing the undamaged half of his face and seeing how he would have been the handsomest man any of them could have known and just wondering "ah, what could have been".

    The movie I reviewed was The Man without a Face starring Mel Gibson as Justin McLeod and newcomer Nick Stahl as Chuck Norstad. The movie was set in scenic upper class neighborhood in Cranesport Maine. The movie focuses on a twelve year old boy, Chuck, who has experienced a difficult childhood, never knowing what really happened to his dad, and a mother that was more interested in finding a new husband than raising her son. Chuck's dream was to get into military school but unfortunately he was unable to pass the entrance exam. Through circumstances, he ran into Justin McLeod a passed educator that was disfigured in a car accident that killed one of his students. Because of his close relationship with his past student, it was implied that his relationship may have been improper so he gave up teaching and lived in isolation. The theme of this movie was based on the relationship between Chuck, a struggling youth without a father figure and a teacher who truly cared about educating his students. As their relationship builds to a true friendship through relentless hours of studying and practice test, Chuck prepares for the entrance exam. Eventually rumors in the small community began to swirl, and once again the relationship he has with his student is again in question. While there is no merit to these accusations, it is deemed by the authorities that they should no longer have contact with one another. Chuck goes on to be successful and graduate military school while Justin McLeod stands in the background demonstrating his undying support for his friend. To develop the theme, there are several scenes that demonstrate Chuck's troubled upbringing, through fights with his sister and a lack of assistance from his mother. While other scenes show the town talking about Mr. McLeod and the circumstances that disfigured his face. All of these scenes helped to isolate each of these individuals leading them only to lean on each other. A movie with a similar theme was Gran Torino. While the movie was not based necessarily on a relationship, it focused on an individual and a group of people that their nationality that did not fit in to current society. The two relied on each other and carried each other through the difficult time. The director chose various techniques to demonstrate the relationship between the two friends. First, the camera angles were direct close-ups that helped the audience understand what they were feeling. There expressions on their face made you love them, understand their pain and hoping the relationship would last forever. The setting also helped you to understand their isolation. Often their talks were in beautiful settings, alone with nobody around. The theme of this movie identified the need we all have to be understood and have people that truly care about our success. The relationship they built was based on a true friendship that could not be altered by influence from the outside. I can only imagine how good the world could be if we all could find the person who brought out the best in us.

    This film is underrated, but being underrated can be a good thing because it might mean that behind the low rating hides a movie that isn't given the deserved credit. Here's a prime example of that. 'The Man Without a Face' is a funny, human, sensitive, touching and harsh movie. It is a lesson of life and it deals a lot with life's problems and serious stuff. Besides, there is also a lot of comedy, which is a surprise for such a serious film. But the combination of these different elements is effective. Mel Gibson is someone I tend to find overrated, as an actor and as a director. But with 'The Man Without a Face' he made a great movie and proved that after all he is worth something as a director and as an actor, thanks to his great acting as Justin McLeod. Nick Stahl is brilliant as Chuck Norstadt. I love his acting, he really convinces in whatever he does in this movie, he's truly that expressive. Chuck is so funny: his hilarious lines, his strong personality, his devilish sense of humor and the extremely goofy facial expressions he does when he is completely "in the moon". He is also very inquisitive, determined and stubborn, It's also funny that, although he is 14 years old, his face is very childish, making him look much younger than he is. However, Chuck is also a troubled and enraged boy. I can't blame him: with a father like he had, a mother like that and an older half-sister like that, no wonder he is a little crazy. Only his younger half-sister is decent. The film can also count with the help of a nice soundtrack (with soft instrumental music and a great oldie song - "Born a Woman" by Sandy Posey), as well as the simple fact that it takes place in Maine - which means it has beautiful vistas, all natural. It is also worth for the old cars and those acquaintanceships in family and with neighbors and friends. Like I said before, this movie is a lesson of life. You can actually learn a lot from it. It's interesting what is possible to learn from it. Title in Portugal: 'Um Homem Sem Rosto'.

    This was a well acted movie, nothing to grandeur to be sure but interesting enough. The film has a boy who actually wants to go to a boarding school which is kind of a nice change of pace, but he does not really have the grades to do so. Well lucky for him there is a recluse living nearby, and he just happens to be a teacher. Well he tries to get this guy's help, but the guy is rather hesitant to do so. He is disfigured thanks to an incident in the past and he is frowned upon by the community. He does take the boy in though as you knew he would have to do seeing as there would not be much of a movie if he did not and the two form a bit of a bond. Not really a big one where the guy makes up for the fact the boy is fatherless, but a student teacher one to be sure. Well something happens and the boy is caught at this mans house by some authorities and there is a big court scene and we learn why the man has lost half his face and why he is frowned upon by the community. Usually I would say this movie is trying to say people unjustly accuse people of things based on appearances and such, but it just does not work in this case as there was sufficient evidence and circumstances to believe the man could have done what he was accused of. Still, Mel Gibson turns in a good performance and it was somewhat entertaining to watch, just nothing that would top any favorite movie lists of mine.

    I first watched this film as a child. My imagination was immediately engrossed, and it hasn't since recovered. McLeod was a commanding figure to me. I related to Chuck on almost every level. I think McLeod's character was very well done. I think the story was standard, but that it was the atmosphere and the characters which carried the movie. What I loved most was McLeod's home and yard. The house is filled with nautical themes, books, and various antique collector items. There is an art studio, since he paints for Time Magazine. You hear the constant noise of falling waves and sea-gulls overhead. There is a blue lake in his back yard about an acre from the house, which itself is hugged by green trees in the front and the sides. But he is lonely. His only company is a German Shepherd named Mickey. He's alone because of his painful past. The reason he is 'without a face' is because he has burns over half his body from a car crash in which a boy was killed. The event was surrounded by controversy. People thought McLeod and the boy were having a sexual relationship of sorts, but the charges were dropped. McLeod was deeply hurt by the incident; not only because a boy died who he cared deeply about, but because of everyone's misperceptions and judgmentalism. So, he chooses to live alone in a big house and stay to himself. He preoccupies himself with building a boat, training his dog, reading books, creating models of ships, painting, playing chess, taking care of his horse, and making his usual trip to the grocery store. There is a very touching scene in which McLeod is brooding over his condition. He feels exiled from humanity. He is on a journey, but doesn't know where to go. Dramatic opera plays in the background. He reads the beginning lines of Virgil's Aenied. After reading, he holds a mirror up to his face, placing the edge on his nose, so that only the unscarred part of his face reflects. For a moment, he looks normal; but as he moves the mirror more and more to the left, more and more of the scars are laid bare, and he is disgusted. I think that is such a symbol of the human condition! Chuck is a dreamer, full of hope. His father killed himself in a mental institution; his mother is manipulative; his older half-sister is malicious; his younger half-sister is kind-hearted, but still only a child. He dreams of going to military school! The only problem is that you have to pass the entrance exams. You need to know Latin and some high-level mathematics. He is in need of a teacher. I won't get into all the details. The movie is great because of the growing relationship of McLeod and Chuck. The movie's scenes of their intimacy are truly delicious. For example, McLeod teaches Chuck how to read poetry and perform Shakespeare plays. McLeod takes home the poem 'High Flight' and reads it in his bathroom in a very sublime scene. All in all, a very good movie!
