 <sinopse>
  A Brooklyn smoke shop is the center of neighborhood activity, and the stories of its customers.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The plot of this movie, like smoke itself, drifts and swirls ethereally. Characters and subplots are deftly woven into a tapestry of stories and pictures which only slowly emerges to our view. This film tries to convince us that reality doesn't matter so much as aesthetic satisfaction. In Auggie's New York smoke shop, day by day passes, seemingly unchanging until he teaches us to notice the little details of life. Paul Benjamin, a disheartened and broken writer, has a brush with death that is pivotal and sets up an unlikely series of events that afford him a novel glimpse into the life on the street which he saw, but did not truly perceive, every day. Finally, it's Auggie's turn to spin a tale....

    Smoke deals with some intertwined destinies that, unfortunately, are never really convincing. One wonders, most of the time, where Wayne Wang and his writer wanted to go, what was the message they wanted to deliver trough these story lines, often composed of laborious and contrived dialogues, that hardly combine, that all lack substance and that even sometimes turn out to be frankly uninteresting as Auggie's ex-wife. The latter, embodied by the excellent Harvey Keitel, is, by the way, the most touching and interesting character, behind the best scene in the movie when he tells his unexpected Christmas to his friend Paul. A certain sincerity emerges from Smoke but it is not enough to compensate for the lacks of this pseudo comedy-drama.

    This rambling drama looks at the intertwined stories of a group of New Yorkers, centered around a cigar shop. While it has its moments, the script is ridiculously contrived, a lackluster mixture of forced sentimentality and pretentious dialog. It is billed as a comedy, but there are no laughs to be had here. The relationships among the characters are not at all believable. There are also subplots, such as the one involving Keitel's ex-wife (Channing in a thankless role) and daughter (Judd in an early role), that are pointless. The acting is uneven, ranging from good (Keitel) to bad (Whitaker) to awful (some of the actors in small roles). Keitel is particularly good in relating a Christmas story.

    This was an independent film that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, all I knew about it was that it had some great names in the cast, and that it was recommended by critics, so I looked forward to watching it, from director Wayne Wang (Maid in Manhattan, Last Holiday). Basically the plot revolves around characters associated in some way with each other and a cigar store in New York, all these characters and subplots are woven together and drift and swirl like ethereal smoke from a cigar. Augustus 'Auggie' Wren (Harvey Keitel) is the manager of the store who has developed a "project" where he photographs the same spot outside his store at the same time every day, and nothing in his day to day life changes until past flame Ruby McNutt (Stockard Channing) comes visiting. Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) is a writer suffering from writer's block, and he is introduced to young African American drifter 'Rashid', real name Thomas Cole (Lost's Harold Perrineau) who saves his life, and he allows the young man to stay with him, while at the same time trying to find something to write about. Ruby comes to tell Auggie that she gave birth to a daughter, and that he is the father, and she wants some money, a few thousand, to help her struggling daughter Felicity (Ashley Judd) who is addicted to alcohol and drugs, and after some time he does help her. Rashid hides a package in Paul's apartment, this is money that he stole from criminal The Creeper (Malik Yoba), who does find the apartment and threaten Paul at gunpoint before being arrested, Rashid is trying to better himself, he manages to get a job in the cigar store, and he also hangs around outside the garage of mechanic Cyrus (Forest Whitaker), who lost his left arm in a car crash with his wife. Rashid, aka Thomas, will not reveal to Cyrus that he is his son, so Paul and Auggie go along with him to the garage, and the truth does come out, Cyrus is at first very angry, but the argument settles during a lunch with him and his new family. The final scene sees Auggie with Paul in a caf&eacute; telling him a story that he could use in a new Christmas themed book, and he tells a story of how a young man stole from his store, dropped his wallet, and some time later he tried to return it, an old lady answered and being blind assumed it was the young man, he went along with it and spent Christmas together, before leaving he took a camera from a pile in the bathroom, and when Auggie returned the next year she had died, a silent montage sees that this tale was true. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito as Tommy, Jos&eacute; Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga as Jerry and Stephen Gevedon as Dennis. The cast all do their parts very well, Keitel being cool and collected, Hurt being concerned and suppressed, Perrineau being mysterious and likable, Channing being needy and sporting an eye-patch, and Judd being feisty and nasty. There is no specific story, but the plot is all put together very well, how the characters connect together in some way is clever, the writing is witty and all the dialogue is engaging, it reminded me of something like Clerks, a near one location film where all you need is talking, it is a really interesting a most watchable drama. Very good!

    If you like a real character movie, in which the movie is foremost all about its acting and characters, this movie is a great one to watch! It's a movie that follows multiple different story lines and characters, with each their own thing going on. They are not necessarily connected, other than through the Harvey Keitel character. And remember, this is a 1995 movie, so please don't expect an Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu type of movie, with a frame narrative in it. It's from before that era, so it's not as slick and 'clever' with all of its different story lines and the way they are connect. It's a more slow and subtle done movie, that has a simple concept and takes a simple approach to it. And nothing wrong with that, since it does indeed work out well for the movie. It's great to see the different story lines and characters slowly progress throughout the movie and to see where it's all leading up to. It's about the little things in life really and doesn't attempt to make things bigger or more heavy than they needed to be. It does in a way let this movie feel as a feel good movie, though it's definitely still foremost done as a drama. It's a good thing that it keeps things light and humble, since this definitely improved the movie its entertainment and rewatchability value. As you would expect, the movie gets mostly carried by its actors. And it really has a fine cast in it, with people such as Harvey Keitel, William Hurt and Forest Whitaker all involved. It's always great to see fine actors act, so that alone already makes this movie worthwhile. It's definitely worth watching if this movie sounds like your kind of thing! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    It spoiled two evenings, because I couldn't bear to watch it in one go. A real waste of some good actors. Hurt and Keitel do their best with their trite, boring lines, but they have nothing to work with in plot, story and dialog. Most of the other acting is worth a finger down the throat. Especially awful is the little scene with the aunt. She doesn't even qualify to be an understudy in a high school play. The pacing is supposed to be moody, but it's just slow and boring. The story is a lot of sentimental claptrap -- black/white feel-good. I would be considered a liberal, but I could not stomach the smarmy, sickeningly sweet racial aspects. It's clear that all the time wasted "up in smoke" is meant for the movie atmosphere, but it is just obviously juvenile. The writer and director should be staked out on the ground and covered with syrup like this movie and left for the ants. I have usually found some value with movies having a 7 or better, but this one destroys my faith in the IMDb ratings. I suffered to the end because of the 7.6, but next time I'll know better.

    An inspired script by Paul Auster, directed by Wayne Wang. There are excellent performances by a large ensemble cast that includes Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Forest Whitaker, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd, and other great character actors I've never heard of. The problem with the movie is that it barely hangs together on the thread of a tobacco store. The philosophical issue is whether you think your life has meaning, starts at the beginning, goes to the end, and you get your reward; or whether you think your life is a series of happenstances that may not be related at all to what's gone before and that you don't build on, but go through and learn from. Maybe. Keitel plays Auggie, the owner of the smoke shop, and the cast of characters comes into his store and his life, and they smoke and tell stories. Most of the stories work - some of them are told, but many of them are 'shown' as the character spins the yarn. Some of the stories didn't work for me, but the promise of more kept me hanging in. This is a quiet movie, a thinker's movie. If you've lived a life that's had its ups and downs, you'll fit right in. Who knows - one of the stories they tell may be yours. And Tom Waits's "You're Beautiful When You Dream" will break your heart. Auster wrote, among other screenplays, "Lulu on the Bridge" (which he also directed), and Wang directed "Joy Luck Club" and a number of other quiet movies.

    I don't give 10's. Having said that this gets a 10 for several reasons: 1. Characters: Many different types that are true to their nature with all the weaknesses/strengths/flaws. They evolve/devolve as the movie goes on. The acting is some of the best you've ever seen. 2: Originality: There aren't a lot films like this one. It stands on its own as a completely original work for slice of life that is not boring. 3: Emotion: You are not tricked buy a music into feeling the emotion. The dialogue, acting and stories do that for you. If you are not moved by these people and their lives, struggles their bits of inspiration I don't know would. 4. Scenes that have stuck with me for years since seeing this film. The scene with Augie and Benjamin with the photos at the end is probably one of the most heart wrenching scenes in all of film; When the two are dancing with their women is so simple but so beautiful; Every single story Augie tells; The explanation of the weight of smoke; The end credits. 5. Acting. You have seen most of these actors before, but rarely at this caliber of acting. William Hurt playing a Jewish writer, flawed but fantastic. Harvey Kietel in one of his best roles ever as an every man not a gangster. Forest Whitaker knocking it out of the park. Ashley Judd you won't even recognize. t's not a popcorn movie. It's one to be enjoyed with a glass of Red wine or a dram of scotch, with a nice smoke. - TPK

    In 'Smoke' writer Paul Auster and director Wayne Wang create a slice of life. The film is divided in chapters, each focussing on a different character. It isn't done randomly as all the down to earth characters are part of the story. 'Smoke' has a whimsical touch to it. It looks like a simplistic painting or a photograph that tells the story of one's daily life and their certain unique circumstances. The movie looks authentic. It does not have the typical Hollywood glossy feel to it. It's more like a walk down the lives of these simple yet wonderful characters. Harvey Keitel is terrific as the cigar store owner and amateur photographer. William Hurt is equally remarkable as a writer who hasn't published a novel since the demise of his wife. Harold Perrineau Jr. holds his own as the young Rashid Cole who forms a friendship with Hurt's Paul Benjamin and Keitel's Augie Wren. Forest Whitaker is excellent as Cole's hardworking father with one arm and Stockard Channing is great as Augie's former lover. The cinematography is simplistic and yet it works brilliantly and the soundtrack itself is another huge plus as it gives voice to the mood of the scene. The visuals of the city only add to the charm. Overall 'Smoke' is a charming slice of life and by the end it ends up bringing a smile to the viewer's face. We don't see the characters living happily ever after but we notice their growth and becoming better human beings.

    I agree with all of the reviewers who have praised the work of Harvey Keitel, William Hurt and others in this film. However, I believe special mention is deserved for the actress who plays the part of an elderly woman in the Christmas story at the end of the film. Without revealing any of the plot, the subtle yet dramatic change in her facial expression, without uttering a single word, blew me away. I hope others agree. Years after seeing this film, the haunting song, Innocent in your Dreams, still comes back to me

    The casting for this movie was terrible but would have been fine for a stage production. If viewed that way it's very enjoyable but a no-name cast could have made it fly. Shame on the producers for thinking it needed help. Hurt intermittently affects an inner city accent which is somewhere between south Boston and south Bronx putting it squarely in the Atlantic Ocean. Channing is not slutty enough, probably because she doesn't try to be. Keitel coasts through his role but is never really the guide his character might be. All of the characters come across as more sophisticated than what credibility demands. It is their individual stories and their interaction which should elevate them but the director has taken that step away from us - and it shouldn't have been. I still gave it a 7 because it is a good story.

Harold Perrineau Jr. holds his own as the young Rashid Cole who forms a friendship with Hurt's Paul Benjamin and Keitel's Augie Wren. Forest Whitaker is excellent as Cole's hardworking father with one arm and Stockard Channing is great as Augie's former lover. The cinematography is simplistic and yet it works brilliantly and the soundtrack itself is another huge plus as it gives voice to the mood of the scene. The visuals of the city only add to the charm. Overall 'Smoke' is a charming slice of life and by the end it ends up bringing a smile to the viewer's face. We don't see the characters living happily ever after but we notice their growth and becoming better human beings.

    I agree with all of the reviewers who have praised the work of Harvey Keitel, William Hurt and others in this film. However, I believe special mention is deserved for the actress who plays the part of an elderly woman in the Christmas story at the end of the film. Without revealing any of the plot, the subtle yet dramatic change in her facial expression, without uttering a single word, blew me away. I hope others agree. Years after seeing this film, the haunting song, Innocent in your Dreams, still comes back to me

    The casting for this movie was terrible but would have been fine for a stage production. If viewed that way it's very enjoyable but a no-name cast could have made it fly. Shame on the producers for thinking it needed help. Hurt intermittently affects an inner city accent which is somewhere between south Boston and south Bronx putting it squarely in the Atlantic Ocean. Channing is not slutty enough, probably because she doesn't try to be. Keitel coasts through his role but is never really the guide his character might be. All of the characters come across as more sophisticated than what credibility demands. It is their individual stories and their interaction which should elevate them but the director has taken that step away from us - and it shouldn't have been. I still gave it a 7 because it is a good story.

    Smoke deals with some intertwined destinies that, unfortunately, are never really convincing. One wonders, most of the time, where Wayne Wang and his writer wanted to go, what was the message they wanted to deliver trough these story lines, often composed of laborious and contrived dialogues, that hardly combine, that all lack substance and that even sometimes turn out to be frankly uninteresting as Auggie's ex-wife. The latter, embodied by the excellent Harvey Keitel, is, by the way, the most touching and interesting character, behind the best scene in the movie when he tells his unexpected Christmas to his friend Paul. A certain sincerity emerges from Smoke but it is not enough to compensate for the lacks of this pseudo comedy-drama.

    This rambling drama looks at the intertwined stories of a group of New Yorkers, centered around a cigar shop. While it has its moments, the script is ridiculously contrived, a lackluster mixture of forced sentimentality and pretentious dialog. It is billed as a comedy, but there are no laughs to be had here. The relationships among the characters are not at all believable. There are also subplots, such as the one involving Keitel's ex-wife (Channing in a thankless role) and daughter (Judd in an early role), that are pointless. The acting is uneven, ranging from good (Keitel) to bad (Whitaker) to awful (some of the actors in small roles). Keitel is particularly good in relating a Christmas story.

    This was an independent film that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, all I knew about it was that it had some great names in the cast, and that it was recommended by critics, so I looked forward to watching it, from director Wayne Wang (Maid in Manhattan, Last Holiday). Basically the plot revolves around characters associated in some way with each other and a cigar store in New York, all these characters and subplots are woven together and drift and swirl like ethereal smoke from a cigar. Augustus 'Auggie' Wren (Harvey Keitel) is the manager of the store who has developed a "project" where he photographs the same spot outside his store at the same time every day, and nothing in his day to day life changes until past flame Ruby McNutt (Stockard Channing) comes visiting. Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) is a writer suffering from writer's block, and he is introduced to young African American drifter 'Rashid', real name Thomas Cole (Lost's Harold Perrineau) who saves his life, and he allows the young man to stay with him, while at the same time trying to find something to write about. Ruby comes to tell Auggie that she gave birth to a daughter, and that he is the father, and she wants some money, a few thousand, to help her struggling daughter Felicity (Ashley Judd) who is addicted to alcohol and drugs, and after some time he does help her. Rashid hides a package in Paul's apartment, this is money that he stole from criminal The Creeper (Malik Yoba), who does find the apartment and threaten Paul at gunpoint before being arrested, Rashid is trying to better himself, he manages to get a job in the cigar store, and he also hangs around outside the garage of mechanic Cyrus (Forest Whitaker), who lost his left arm in a car crash with his wife. Rashid, aka Thomas, will not reveal to Cyrus that he is his son, so Paul and Auggie go along with him to the garage, and the truth does come out, Cyrus is at first very angry, but the argument settles during a lunch with him and his new family. The final scene sees Auggie with Paul in a caf&eacute; telling him a story that he could use in a new Christmas themed book, and he tells a story of how a young man stole from his store, dropped his wallet, and some time later he tried to return it, an old lady answered and being blind assumed it was the young man, he went along with it and spent Christmas together, before leaving he took a camera from a pile in the bathroom, and when Auggie returned the next year she had died, a silent montage sees that this tale was true. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito as Tommy, Jos&eacute; Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga as Jerry and Stephen Gevedon as Dennis. The cast all do their parts very well, Keitel being cool and collected, Hurt being concerned and suppressed, Perrineau being mysterious and likable, Channing being needy and sporting an eye-patch, and Judd being feisty and nasty. There is no specific story, but the plot is all put together very well, how the characters connect together in some way is clever, the writing is witty and all the dialogue is engaging, it reminded me of something like Clerks, a near one location film where all you need is talking, it is a really interesting a most watchable drama. Very good!

    If you like a real character movie, in which the movie is foremost all about its acting and characters, this movie is a great one to watch! It's a movie that follows multiple different story lines and characters, with each their own thing going on. They are not necessarily connected, other than through the Harvey Keitel character. And remember, this is a 1995 movie, so please don't expect an Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu type of movie, with a frame narrative in it. It's from before that era, so it's not as slick and 'clever' with all of its different story lines and the way they are connect. It's a more slow and subtle done movie, that has a simple concept and takes a simple approach to it. And nothing wrong with that, since it does indeed work out well for the movie. It's great to see the different story lines and characters slowly progress throughout the movie and to see where it's all leading up to. It's about the little things in life really and doesn't attempt to make things bigger or more heavy than they needed to be. It does in a way let this movie feel as a feel good movie, though it's definitely still foremost done as a drama. It's a good thing that it keeps things light and humble, since this definitely improved the movie its entertainment and rewatchability value. As you would expect, the movie gets mostly carried by its actors. And it really has a fine cast in it, with people such as Harvey Keitel, William Hurt and Forest Whitaker all involved. It's always great to see fine actors act, so that alone already makes this movie worthwhile. It's definitely worth watching if this movie sounds like your kind of thing! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    It spoiled two evenings, because I couldn't bear to watch it in one go. A real waste of some good actors. Hurt and Keitel do their best with their trite, boring lines, but they have nothing to work with in plot, story and dialog. Most of the other acting is worth a finger down the throat. Especially awful is the little scene with the aunt. She doesn't even qualify to be an understudy in a high school play. The pacing is supposed to be moody, but it's just slow and boring. The story is a lot of sentimental claptrap -- black/white feel-good. I would be considered a liberal, but I could not stomach the smarmy, sickeningly sweet racial aspects. It's clear that all the time wasted "up in smoke" is meant for the movie atmosphere, but it is just obviously juvenile. The writer and director should be staked out on the ground and covered with syrup like this movie and left for the ants. I have usually found some value with movies having a 7 or better, but this one destroys my faith in the IMDb ratings. I suffered to the end because of the 7.6, but next time I'll know better.

    An inspired script by Paul Auster, directed by Wayne Wang. There are excellent performances by a large ensemble cast that includes Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Forest Whitaker, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd, and other great character actors I've never heard of. The problem with the movie is that it barely hangs together on the thread of a tobacco store. The philosophical issue is whether you think your life has meaning, starts at the beginning, goes to the end, and you get your reward; or whether you think your life is a series of happenstances that may not be related at all to what's gone before and that you don't build on, but go through and learn from. Maybe. Keitel plays Auggie, the owner of the smoke shop, and the cast of characters comes into his store and his life, and they smoke and tell stories. Most of the stories work - some of them are told, but many of them are 'shown' as the character spins the yarn. Some of the stories didn't work for me, but the promise of more kept me hanging in. This is a quiet movie, a thinker's movie. If you've lived a life that's had its ups and downs, you'll fit right in. Who knows - one of the stories they tell may be yours. And Tom Waits's "You're Beautiful When You Dream" will break your heart. Auster wrote, among other screenplays, "Lulu on the Bridge" (which he also directed), and Wang directed "Joy Luck Club" and a number of other quiet movies.

    I don't give 10's. Having said that this gets a 10 for several reasons: 1. Characters: Many different types that are true to their nature with all the weaknesses/strengths/flaws. They evolve/devolve as the movie goes on. The acting is some of the best you've ever seen. 2: Originality: There aren't a lot films like this one. It stands on its own as a completely original work for slice of life that is not boring. 3: Emotion: You are not tricked buy a music into feeling the emotion. The dialogue, acting and stories do that for you. If you are not moved by these people and their lives, struggles their bits of inspiration I don't know would. 4. Scenes that have stuck with me for years since seeing this film. The scene with Augie and Benjamin with the photos at the end is probably one of the most heart wrenching scenes in all of film; When the two are dancing with their women is so simple but so beautiful; Every single story Augie tells; The explanation of the weight of smoke; The end credits. 5. Acting. You have seen most of these actors before, but rarely at this caliber of acting. William Hurt playing a Jewish writer, flawed but fantastic. Harvey Kietel in one of his best roles ever as an every man not a gangster. Forest Whitaker knocking it out of the park. Ashley Judd you won't even recognize. t's not a popcorn movie. It's one to be enjoyed with a glass of Red wine or a dram of scotch, with a nice smoke. - TPK

    In 'Smoke' writer Paul Auster and director Wayne Wang create a slice of life. The film is divided in chapters, each focussing on a different character. It isn't done randomly as all the down to earth characters are part of the story. 'Smoke' has a whimsical touch to it. It looks like a simplistic painting or a photograph that tells the story of one's daily life and their certain unique circumstances. The movie looks authentic. It does not have the typical Hollywood glossy feel to it. It's more like a walk down the lives of these simple yet wonderful characters. Harvey Keitel is terrific as the cigar store owner and amateur photographer. William Hurt is equally remarkable as a writer who hasn't published a novel since the demise of his wife. Harold Perrineau Jr. holds his own as the young Rashid Cole who forms a friendship with Hurt's Paul Benjamin and Keitel's Augie Wren. Forest Whitaker is excellent as Cole's hardworking father with one arm and Stockard Channing is great as Augie's former lover.

It looks like a simplistic painting or a photograph that tells the story of one's daily life and their certain unique circumstances. The movie looks authentic. It does not have the typical Hollywood glossy feel to it. It's more like a walk down the lives of these simple yet wonderful characters. Harvey Keitel is terrific as the cigar store owner and amateur photographer. William Hurt is equally remarkable as a writer who hasn't published a novel since the demise of his wife. Harold Perrineau Jr. holds his own as the young Rashid Cole who forms a friendship with Hurt's Paul Benjamin and Keitel's Augie Wren. Forest Whitaker is excellent as Cole's hardworking father with one arm and Stockard Channing is great as Augie's former lover. The cinematography is simplistic and yet it works brilliantly and the soundtrack itself is another huge plus as it gives voice to the mood of the scene. The visuals of the city only add to the charm. Overall 'Smoke' is a charming slice of life and by the end it ends up bringing a smile to the viewer's face. We don't see the characters living happily ever after but we notice their growth and becoming better human beings.

    I agree with all of the reviewers who have praised the work of Harvey Keitel, William Hurt and others in this film. However, I believe special mention is deserved for the actress who plays the part of an elderly woman in the Christmas story at the end of the film. Without revealing any of the plot, the subtle yet dramatic change in her facial expression, without uttering a single word, blew me away. I hope others agree. Years after seeing this film, the haunting song, Innocent in your Dreams, still comes back to me

    The casting for this movie was terrible but would have been fine for a stage production. If viewed that way it's very enjoyable but a no-name cast could have made it fly. Shame on the producers for thinking it needed help. Hurt intermittently affects an inner city accent which is somewhere between south Boston and south Bronx putting it squarely in the Atlantic Ocean. Channing is not slutty enough, probably because she doesn't try to be. Keitel coasts through his role but is never really the guide his character might be. All of the characters come across as more sophisticated than what credibility demands. It is their individual stories and their interaction which should elevate them but the director has taken that step away from us - and it shouldn't have been. I still gave it a 7 because it is a good story.

    Smoke deals with some intertwined destinies that, unfortunately, are never really convincing. One wonders, most of the time, where Wayne Wang and his writer wanted to go, what was the message they wanted to deliver trough these story lines, often composed of laborious and contrived dialogues, that hardly combine, that all lack substance and that even sometimes turn out to be frankly uninteresting as Auggie's ex-wife. The latter, embodied by the excellent Harvey Keitel, is, by the way, the most touching and interesting character, behind the best scene in the movie when he tells his unexpected Christmas to his friend Paul. A certain sincerity emerges from Smoke but it is not enough to compensate for the lacks of this pseudo comedy-drama.

    This rambling drama looks at the intertwined stories of a group of New Yorkers, centered around a cigar shop. While it has its moments, the script is ridiculously contrived, a lackluster mixture of forced sentimentality and pretentious dialog. It is billed as a comedy, but there are no laughs to be had here. The relationships among the characters are not at all believable. There are also subplots, such as the one involving Keitel's ex-wife (Channing in a thankless role) and daughter (Judd in an early role), that are pointless. The acting is uneven, ranging from good (Keitel) to bad (Whitaker) to awful (some of the actors in small roles). Keitel is particularly good in relating a Christmas story.

    This was an independent film that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, all I knew about it was that it had some great names in the cast, and that it was recommended by critics, so I looked forward to watching it, from director Wayne Wang (Maid in Manhattan, Last Holiday). Basically the plot revolves around characters associated in some way with each other and a cigar store in New York, all these characters and subplots are woven together and drift and swirl like ethereal smoke from a cigar. Augustus 'Auggie' Wren (Harvey Keitel) is the manager of the store who has developed a "project" where he photographs the same spot outside his store at the same time every day, and nothing in his day to day life changes until past flame Ruby McNutt (Stockard Channing) comes visiting. Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) is a writer suffering from writer's block, and he is introduced to young African American drifter 'Rashid', real name Thomas Cole (Lost's Harold Perrineau) who saves his life, and he allows the young man to stay with him, while at the same time trying to find something to write about. Ruby comes to tell Auggie that she gave birth to a daughter, and that he is the father, and she wants some money, a few thousand, to help her struggling daughter Felicity (Ashley Judd) who is addicted to alcohol and drugs, and after some time he does help her. Rashid hides a package in Paul's apartment, this is money that he stole from criminal The Creeper (Malik Yoba), who does find the apartment and threaten Paul at gunpoint before being arrested, Rashid is trying to better himself, he manages to get a job in the cigar store, and he also hangs around outside the garage of mechanic Cyrus (Forest Whitaker), who lost his left arm in a car crash with his wife. Rashid, aka Thomas, will not reveal to Cyrus that he is his son, so Paul and Auggie go along with him to the garage, and the truth does come out, Cyrus is at first very angry, but the argument settles during a lunch with him and his new family. The final scene sees Auggie with Paul in a caf&eacute; telling him a story that he could use in a new Christmas themed book, and he tells a story of how a young man stole from his store, dropped his wallet, and some time later he tried to return it, an old lady answered and being blind assumed it was the young man, he went along with it and spent Christmas together, before leaving he took a camera from a pile in the bathroom, and when Auggie returned the next year she had died, a silent montage sees that this tale was true. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito as Tommy, Jos&eacute; Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga as Jerry and Stephen Gevedon as Dennis. The cast all do their parts very well, Keitel being cool and collected, Hurt being concerned and suppressed, Perrineau being mysterious and likable, Channing being needy and sporting an eye-patch, and Judd being feisty and nasty. There is no specific story, but the plot is all put together very well, how the characters connect together in some way is clever, the writing is witty and all the dialogue is engaging, it reminded me of something like Clerks, a near one location film where all you need is talking, it is a really interesting a most watchable drama. Very good!

    If you like a real character movie, in which the movie is foremost all about its acting and characters, this movie is a great one to watch! It's a movie that follows multiple different story lines and characters, with each their own thing going on. They are not necessarily connected, other than through the Harvey Keitel character. And remember, this is a 1995 movie, so please don't expect an Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu type of movie, with a frame narrative in it. It's from before that era, so it's not as slick and 'clever' with all of its different story lines and the way they are connect. It's a more slow and subtle done movie, that has a simple concept and takes a simple approach to it. And nothing wrong with that, since it does indeed work out well for the movie. It's great to see the different story lines and characters slowly progress throughout the movie and to see where it's all leading up to. It's about the little things in life really and doesn't attempt to make things bigger or more heavy than they needed to be. It does in a way let this movie feel as a feel good movie, though it's definitely still foremost done as a drama. It's a good thing that it keeps things light and humble, since this definitely improved the movie its entertainment and rewatchability value. As you would expect, the movie gets mostly carried by its actors. And it really has a fine cast in it, with people such as Harvey Keitel, William Hurt and Forest Whitaker all involved. It's always great to see fine actors act, so that alone already makes this movie worthwhile. It's definitely worth watching if this movie sounds like your kind of thing! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    It spoiled two evenings, because I couldn't bear to watch it in one go. A real waste of some good actors. Hurt and Keitel do their best with their trite, boring lines, but they have nothing to work with in plot, story and dialog. Most of the other acting is worth a finger down the throat. Especially awful is the little scene with the aunt. She doesn't even qualify to be an understudy in a high school play. The pacing is supposed to be moody, but it's just slow and boring. The story is a lot of sentimental claptrap -- black/white feel-good. I would be considered a liberal, but I could not stomach the smarmy, sickeningly sweet racial aspects. It's clear that all the time wasted "up in smoke" is meant for the movie atmosphere, but it is just obviously juvenile. The writer and director should be staked out on the ground and covered with syrup like this movie and left for the ants. I have usually found some value with movies having a 7 or better, but this one destroys my faith in the IMDb ratings. I suffered to the end because of the 7.6, but next time I'll know better.

    An inspired script by Paul Auster, directed by Wayne Wang. There are excellent performances by a large ensemble cast that includes Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Forest Whitaker, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd, and other great character actors I've never heard of. The problem with the movie is that it barely hangs together on the thread of a tobacco store. The philosophical issue is whether you think your life has meaning, starts at the beginning, goes to the end, and you get your reward; or whether you think your life is a series of happenstances that may not be related at all to what's gone before and that you don't build on, but go through and learn from. Maybe. Keitel plays Auggie, the owner of the smoke shop, and the cast of characters comes into his store and his life, and they smoke and tell stories. Most of the stories work - some of them are told, but many of them are 'shown' as the character spins the yarn. Some of the stories didn't work for me, but the promise of more kept me hanging in. This is a quiet movie, a thinker's movie. If you've lived a life that's had its ups and downs, you'll fit right in. Who knows - one of the stories they tell may be yours. And Tom Waits's "You're Beautiful When You Dream" will break your heart. Auster wrote, among other screenplays, "Lulu on the Bridge" (which he also directed), and Wang directed "Joy Luck Club" and a number of other quiet movies.

    I don't give 10's. Having said that this gets a 10 for several reasons: 1. Characters: Many different types that are true to their nature with all the weaknesses/strengths/flaws. They evolve/devolve as the movie goes on. The acting is some of the best you've ever seen. 2: Originality: There aren't a lot films like this one. It stands on its own as a completely original work for slice of life that is not boring. 3: Emotion: You are not tricked buy a music into feeling the emotion. The dialogue, acting and stories do that for you. If you are not moved by these people and their lives, struggles their bits of inspiration I don't know would. 4. Scenes that have stuck with me for years since seeing this film. The scene with Augie and Benjamin with the photos at the end is probably one of the most heart wrenching scenes in all of film; When the two are dancing with their women is so simple but so beautiful; Every single story Augie tells; The explanation of the weight of smoke; The end credits. 5. Acting. You have seen most of these actors before, but rarely at this caliber of acting. William Hurt playing a Jewish writer, flawed but fantastic. Harvey Kietel in one of his best roles ever as an every man not a gangster. Forest Whitaker knocking it out of the park. Ashley Judd you won't even recognize. t's not a popcorn movie. It's one to be enjoyed with a glass of Red wine or a dram of scotch, with a nice smoke. - TPK

    In 'Smoke' writer Paul Auster and director Wayne Wang create a slice of life. The film is divided in chapters, each focussing on a different character. It isn't done randomly as all the down to earth characters are part of the story. 'Smoke' has a whimsical touch to it. It looks like a simplistic painting or a photograph that tells the story of one's daily life and their certain unique circumstances. The movie looks authentic. It does not have the typical Hollywood glossy feel to it. It's more like a walk down the lives of these simple yet wonderful characters. Harvey Keitel is terrific as the cigar store owner and amateur photographer. William Hurt is equally remarkable as a writer who hasn't published a novel since the demise of his wife. Harold Perrineau Jr. holds his own as the young Rashid Cole who forms a friendship with Hurt's Paul Benjamin and Keitel's Augie Wren. Forest Whitaker is excellent as Cole's hardworking father with one arm and Stockard Channing is great as Augie's former lover. The cinematography is simplistic and yet it works brilliantly and the soundtrack itself is another huge plus as it gives voice to the mood of the scene. The visuals of the city only add to the charm. Overall 'Smoke' is a charming slice of life and by the end it ends up bringing a smile to the viewer's face. We don't see the characters living happily ever after but we notice their growth and becoming better human beings.

    I agree with all of the reviewers who have praised the work of Harvey Keitel, William Hurt and others in this film. However, I believe special mention is deserved for the actress who plays the part of an elderly woman in the Christmas story at the end of the film. Without revealing any of the plot, the subtle yet dramatic change in her facial expression, without uttering a single word, blew me away. I hope others agree. Years after seeing this film, the haunting song, Innocent in your Dreams, still comes back to me

    The casting for this movie was terrible but would have been fine for a stage production. If viewed that way it's very enjoyable but a no-name cast could have made it fly. Shame on the producers for thinking it needed help. Hurt intermittently affects an inner city accent which is somewhere between south Boston and south Bronx putting it squarely in the Atlantic Ocean. Channing is not slutty enough, probably because she doesn't try to be. Keitel coasts through his role but is never really the guide his character might be. All of the characters come across as more sophisticated than what credibility demands. It is their individual stories and their interaction which should elevate them but the director has taken that step away from us - and it shouldn't have been. I still gave it a 7 because it is a good story.

    Smoke deals with some intertwined destinies that, unfortunately, are never really convincing. One wonders, most of the time, where Wayne Wang and his writer wanted to go, what was the message they wanted to deliver trough these story lines, often composed of laborious and contrived dialogues, that hardly combine, that all lack substance and that even sometimes turn out to be frankly uninteresting as Auggie's ex-wife. The latter, embodied by the excellent Harvey Keitel, is, by the way, the most touching and interesting character, behind the best scene in the movie when he tells his unexpected Christmas to his friend Paul. A certain sincerity emerges from Smoke but it is not enough to compensate for the lacks of this pseudo comedy-drama.

    This rambling drama looks at the intertwined stories of a group of New Yorkers, centered around a cigar shop. While it has its moments, the script is ridiculously contrived, a lackluster mixture of forced sentimentality and pretentious dialog. It is billed as a comedy, but there are no laughs to be had here. The relationships among the characters are not at all believable. There are also subplots, such as the one involving Keitel's ex-wife (Channing in a thankless role) and daughter (Judd in an early role), that are pointless. The acting is uneven, ranging from good (Keitel) to bad (Whitaker) to awful (some of the actors in small roles). Keitel is particularly good in relating a Christmas story.

    This was an independent film that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, all I knew about it was that it had some great names in the cast, and that it was recommended by critics, so I looked forward to watching it, from director Wayne Wang (Maid in Manhattan, Last Holiday). Basically the plot revolves around characters associated in some way with each other and a cigar store in New York, all these characters and subplots are woven together and drift and swirl like ethereal smoke from a cigar. Augustus 'Auggie' Wren (Harvey Keitel) is the manager of the store who has developed a "project" where he photographs the same spot outside his store at the same time every day, and nothing in his day to day life changes until past flame Ruby McNutt (Stockard Channing) comes visiting. Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) is a writer suffering from writer's block, and he is introduced to young African American drifter 'Rashid', real name Thomas Cole (Lost's Harold Perrineau) who saves his life, and he allows the young man to stay with him, while at the same time trying to find something to write about. Ruby comes to tell Auggie that she gave birth to a daughter, and that he is the father, and she wants some money, a few thousand, to help her struggling daughter Felicity (Ashley Judd) who is addicted to alcohol and drugs, and after some time he does help her. Rashid hides a package in Paul's apartment, this is money that he stole from criminal The Creeper (Malik Yoba), who does find the apartment and threaten Paul at gunpoint before being arrested, Rashid is trying to better himself, he manages to get a job in the cigar store, and he also hangs around outside the garage of mechanic Cyrus (Forest Whitaker), who lost his left arm in a car crash with his wife. Rashid, aka Thomas, will not reveal to Cyrus that he is his son, so Paul and Auggie go along with him to the garage, and the truth does come out, Cyrus is at first very angry, but the argument settles during a lunch with him and his new family. The final scene sees Auggie with Paul in a caf&eacute; telling him a story that he could use in a new Christmas themed book, and he tells a story of how a young man stole from his store, dropped his wallet, and some time later he tried to return it, an old lady answered and being blind assumed it was the young man, he went along with it and spent Christmas together, before leaving he took a camera from a pile in the bathroom, and when Auggie returned the next year she had died, a silent montage sees that this tale was true. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito as Tommy, Jos&eacute; Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga as Jerry and Stephen Gevedon as Dennis. The cast all do their parts very well, Keitel being cool and collected, Hurt being concerned and suppressed, Perrineau being mysterious and likable, Channing being needy and sporting an eye-patch, and Judd being feisty and nasty. There is no specific story, but the plot is all put together very well, how the characters connect together in some way is clever, the writing is witty and all the dialogue is engaging, it reminded me of something like Clerks, a near one location film where all you need is talking, it is a really interesting a most watchable drama. Very good!

    If you like a real character movie, in which the movie is foremost all about its acting and characters, this movie is a great one to watch! It's a movie that follows multiple different story lines and characters, with each their own thing going on. They are not necessarily connected, other than through the Harvey Keitel character. And remember, this is a 1995 movie, so please don't expect an Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu type of movie, with a frame narrative in it. It's from before that era, so it's not as slick and 'clever' with all of its different story lines and the way they are connect. It's a more slow and subtle done movie, that has a simple concept and takes a simple approach to it. And nothing wrong with that, since it does indeed work out well for the movie. It's great to see the different story lines and characters slowly progress throughout the movie and to see where it's all leading up to. It's about the little things in life really and doesn't attempt to make things bigger or more heavy than they needed to be. It does in a way let this movie feel as a feel good movie, though it's definitely still foremost done as a drama. It's a good thing that it keeps things light and humble, since this definitely improved the movie its entertainment and rewatchability value. As you would expect, the movie gets mostly carried by its actors. And it really has a fine cast in it, with people such as Harvey Keitel, William Hurt and Forest Whitaker all involved. It's always great to see fine actors act, so that alone already makes this movie worthwhile. It's definitely worth watching if this movie sounds like your kind of thing! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    It spoiled two evenings, because I couldn't bear to watch it in one go. A real waste of some good actors. Hurt and Keitel do their best with their trite, boring lines, but they have nothing to work with in plot, story and dialog. Most of the other acting is worth a finger down the throat. Especially awful is the little scene with the aunt. She doesn't even qualify to be an understudy in a high school play. The pacing is supposed to be moody, but it's just slow and boring. The story is a lot of sentimental claptrap -- black/white feel-good. I would be considered a liberal, but I could not stomach the smarmy, sickeningly sweet racial aspects. It's clear that all the time wasted "up in smoke" is meant for the movie atmosphere, but it is just obviously juvenile. The writer and director should be staked out on the ground and covered with syrup like this movie and left for the ants. I have usually found some value with movies having a 7 or better, but this one destroys my faith in the IMDb ratings. I suffered to the end because of the 7.6, but next time I'll know better.

    An inspired script by Paul Auster, directed by Wayne Wang. There are excellent performances by a large ensemble cast that includes Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Forest Whitaker, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd, and other great character actors I've never heard of. The problem with the movie is that it barely hangs together on the thread of a tobacco store. The philosophical issue is whether you think your life has meaning, starts at the beginning, goes to the end, and you get your reward; or whether you think your life is a series of happenstances that may not be related at all to what's gone before and that you don't build on, but go through and learn from. Maybe. Keitel plays Auggie, the owner of the smoke shop, and the cast of characters comes into his store and his life, and they smoke and tell stories. Most of the stories work - some of them are told, but many of them are 'shown' as the character spins the yarn. Some of the stories didn't work for me, but the promise of more kept me hanging in. This is a quiet movie, a thinker's movie. If you've lived a life that's had its ups and downs, you'll fit right in. Who knows - one of the stories they tell may be yours. And Tom Waits's "You're Beautiful When You Dream" will break your heart. Auster wrote, among other screenplays, "Lulu on the Bridge" (which he also directed), and Wang directed "Joy Luck Club" and a number of other quiet movies.

    I don't give 10's. Having said that this gets a 10 for several reasons: 1. Characters: Many different types that are true to their nature with all the weaknesses/strengths/flaws. They evolve/devolve as the movie goes on. The acting is some of the best you've ever seen. 2: Originality: There aren't a lot films like this one. It stands on its own as a completely original work for slice of life that is not boring. 3: Emotion: You are not tricked buy a music into feeling the emotion. The dialogue, acting and stories do that for you. If you are not moved by these people and their lives, struggles their bits of inspiration I don't know would. 4. Scenes that have stuck with me for years since seeing this film. The scene with Augie and Benjamin with the photos at the end is probably one of the most heart wrenching scenes in all of film; When the two are dancing with their women is so simple but so beautiful; Every single story Augie tells; The explanation of the weight of smoke; The end credits. 5. Acting. You have seen most of these actors before, but rarely at this caliber of acting. William Hurt playing a Jewish writer, flawed but fantastic. Harvey Kietel in one of his best roles ever as an every man not a gangster. Forest Whitaker knocking it out of the park. Ashley Judd you won't even recognize. t's not a popcorn movie. It's one to be enjoyed with a glass of Red wine or a dram of scotch, with a nice smoke. - TPK
