    Opening with a saxophone-punctuated, little jazz/pop ditty (penned by Burt Bacharach) containing lyrics that go like this - "Beware of the blob! It creeps and leaps and glides and slides across the floor...." - You can bet that this super-schlocky, 1950s, teen, Sci-Fi/Horror flick is guaranteed to deliver (in all of its dead-seriousness) a literal score of priceless, unintentional laughs from start to finish. And laughs it certainly does produce - Even before the big-bad blob, in all of its gelatinous, cherry-colored glory, makes its first gooey screen-appearance. From its hilariously dumb dialog, to its totally wooden performances, to its goofy, low-budget special effects - The Blob is sure to please any hardcore fan of 1950s, B-movie junk. You can bet on that. I mean, how can you possibly go wrong with such wacky highlights that include the blob (growing bigger by the minute) attacking a petrified nurse in Dr. Hallen's office and the blob (now even bigger and meaner than you could ever imagine) invading the local movie theater during a midnight movie show, causing the piercing screams of sheer panic and horrified mayhem to prevail at full-throttle.

    The Blob is an average horror film with a good idea that is fun but doesn't go above and beyond to be impressive and make it a sure classic. An alien lifeform lands on Earth and consumes everything and gets bigger and bigger as it eats, causing panic among the towns citizens. Now the local townsfolk must stop this blob from destroying the town before everything there is consumed into a big blob. The film is a simple alien story and a fine story with some very interesting scenes but doesn't keep our interests throughout as it's story is dull with average characters. The film does have some very memorable scenes though like the movie theater scene when the blob enters and everything turns to mayhem and also when it enters the office and eats the man while he pounds violently against the shades and screaming in terror. An alien movie is not a bad idea for the time, but it is not a great idea for an alien as they could have gave it an eerie appearance like in War of the Worlds to make it spooky instead of lame. I found most of the scares to be dull and boring when it is supposed to be shocking and tense. The Blob is not a bad movie, and is fun when it is supposed to be scary, but it is average and not great. A good film. Grade: B

    Two young adults named "Steve Andrews" (Steve McQueen) and "Jane Martin" (Aneta Corsaut) are star-gazing late at night on the outskirts of town when they see what appears to be a meteor hit the earth not far from where they are parked. An old man living out in the woods also hears the meteor impact and goes to investigate. He finds what appears to be a large spoor of some kind and upon further inspection happens to get a gooey substance from the spoor on his hand. As the substance begins to grow the old man runs screaming into the road where Steve and Jane just happen to be driving. Realizing that he is in a great deal of pain they put him into the back of their car and race to the doctor's office in town. But even there the substance continues to grow and has now developed an insatiable appetite which threatens the entire town. Anyway, rather than divulge the entire story, I will just say that this was a movie produced back in the 50's which was tailor-made for the local drive-in on a Saturday night. Obviously, the special effects are extremely primitive by today's standards and the script was a little corny at times. Well, maybe more than a "little" corny. But this is still an entertaining movie all the same and I recommend it to those who are capable of making allowances.

    A young couple out for a night of fun get more than they bargained for when attacked by 'The Blob'. While taking a drive with his girlfriend Jane, Steve see's an old man in the road with something on his hand, begging for help. It all begins when something mysterious lands on Earth, a giant blob which resembles a jelly latches onto an old man's hand. When the couple take the man to the clinic, they think it's all over. But it's only the beginning. The blob completely consumes the man as well as the doctor and therefore grows bigger and bigger. Pretty soon it rolls around the little town, killing anything in sight. It's up to Steve, Jane and the police force to put an end to it's reign of terror before it consumes everyone. Watching 'The Blob' in 2013 made me realize that this 1958 film actually dates pretty well. The fashion and acting isn't all that different (or over the top) than what we see now. It's well acted with Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut leading the way, and I'm sure was genuinely creepy at the time it was released. There are quite a few tense moments in which the giant blob attacks the doctor and nurse at the local clinic, and then goes after movie-goers at a theatre! It was very well done, the director did a great job at creating panic and the sense of fear with the people in the town. It can get a little slow around the middle frame after a strong start, that's probably the film's biggest weakness. However, the ending scenes when it attacks at the theatre and the diner are worth sticking around for. I also liked that the entire movie takes place on one night, it helps it not drag on and on too much. Highly recommended "old time" monster movie. 8/10

    Not all that bad from black and white Colour, it worked better here, then The Night of the living dead (1968), which was better to see in Black and white. I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot of fun and there were some really good decent funny moment in this B-movie and the movie was really paced well, a lot stuff happens and never dull moment to take you off screen., The only think that annoyed me a little boy, it so annoying the way he spoke were so bad, it liked it was forced, Other wises the acting was really good from the whole cast! I really enjoyed this b-,movie I going to give it 7 out of 10

    What started as a cheap b-movie became a cult classic. The Blob reportedly cost as low as 110,000 dollars, a small budget even by 1958 standards. Released by Paramount, it went on to gross four million dollars. The reasons for this were a unique monster, a smart script, and good direction. Due to the low budget, the story takes place in a small town, whereas other monsters of the 1950s were rampaging through big cities like New York and Tokyo. It was filmed in several suburbs of eastern Pennsylvania. For example, the diner was in Downingtown, while the movie theater was in neighboring Phoenixville. The flesh-eating Blob from space has been described as an amoeba, slime, pudding, and even a giant wad of chewing gum. In reality it was silicone gel with purple dye. The special effects were impressive for the time and budget. We see the Blob move and seep through openings. Small at first, it grows larger with each victim it consumes, leaving no evidence. It also changes color from translucent to purplish, almost blood red. Eventually the Blob becomes large enough to send people screaming from a theater (People who saw this film in theaters must have been looking over their shoulders during that scene). By the film's climax, the oozing horror is so large that it envelopes a diner, trapping the people inside. Due to its malleable nature, physical attacks have no effect on the creature. Nor do fire, acid or electricity. Indeed, it seems that nothing on earth can destroy it. The only way to stop the Blob is to freeze it, and even then, it may thaw out eventually. Thus the film ends with a question mark, and leaves the door open for a sequel. There was also good acting from a cast of unknowns, including young Steve McQueen in a star-making performance. The Blob was not the first teen horror film, although it was the first fully in color. AIP's I was a Teenage Werewolf, which launched the career of another young actor named Michael Landon, preceded it by a year. The whole story takes place over one long night. At first the adults will not believe Steve and his girlfriend about the Blob, especially one cop who is prejudiced against teenagers. Luckily Lt. Dave (Earl Rowe) is more sympathetic. The film has flaws, such as the fact that McQueen was clearly not a teenager, and some extras can be seen smiling when they are supposed to be fleeing in terror. Nor was the creature completely original. There already was a similar monster in X the Unknown (1956), but the makers of The Blob went the extra step of filming it in color. There was also the short story Slime by Joseph Payne Brennan, first published in the March 1953 issue of Weird Tales. But Blob seems based on a 1950 newspaper story about a mysterious purple substance found by Philly police. The film had a campy sequel in 1972 and a gory remake in 1988.

    I really had such a great time watching this film. It is very interesting that this is the film debut of Steve McQueen, good old Steve, good old badass. A typical story of 50s SF... a meteor falls down in... America of course, it is actually a protoplasmic blob and it's hungry! And guess what, blob's favorite food is human flesh, wow... Of course, police would not believe a bunch of young kids, so the blob will spread and made a disaster in the small town. I found this film entertaining, funny and unusual. Why is that? Because it is pretty rare, the rare idea for a large jelly mass to spread all over and eats everything in it's path... We usually have monsters, giant insects... all that stuff... but a large jelly blob? No way! It's interesting that the sequel was released in 1971, but, it didn't do any good. This one is better. Go, Steve!

    When a meteorite crash spews forth a ravenous alien blob that devours everything it touches, a group of teens race to warn the disbelieving adults in town about the creature before it's rampage consumes the entire area. Not really all that great as I thought it would be, as there's some pretty big flaws to this one. One of the main ones here is due to the consistently irritating efforts of the film to stay with the teens and their lifestyle that serve almost no entertainment value since I don't enjoy that lifestyle at all, leaving the beginning to feel way too slowed down and convoluted, having to jump back into the plot almost an after-thought the way it's so clumsily handled because they're showcasing the teens rather than keeping the story moving. The attacks, though, are a lot of fun and generate some good suspense and action, particularly the finale in the diner where it seems to spread everywhere and resulting in lots of ways to go at the being, so it does save itself some particular points that way, but it could've had a lot more with a bit of reworking. Today's Rating/PG: Violence

    "The Blob" is chiefly remembered now for launching Steve McQueen's career. Soon after the release of this film, he was offered the role of Josh Randall on the hit TV series "Wanted: Dead or Alive," and super-stardom was only a few years away. Here, billed as "Steven" McQueen, he leads a pack of teenagers who are determined to stop the Blob from devouring their small town. The main problem is that the authorities (i.e. the local police) refuse to believe their story about a "monster" killing people and think it's all a "gag." Hatched from a meteor, the Blob itself (with the help of about $100 worth of Special Effects) is a magnified slab of Jell-O that looks like it's been leftover from yesterday's desert menu. As the film progresses, it gets bigger and bigger and is soon eating up whole buildings. The 28-year-old McQueen, who's supposed to be a teenager himself in the movie, is smart enough to figure out that this evil hunk of space glob can't stand low temperatures. In no time, everyone in town is bombarding it with CO-2 Fire Extinguishers and putting it into the deep freeze. The best scene in the film is when the Blob attacks the downtown theater during a midnight showing of monster movies and the panicking and screaming (actually smiling and laughing) crowd comes running out into the street. "The Blob" was distributed by Paramount Pictures who quite rightly figured it would be a smash hit with teenagers and it certainly was all of that. Broke at the time, McQueen settled for a $3000 flat fee for his services although he was also offered 10% of the gross profits in lieu of any upfront money. That turned out to be a mistake. Also in the cast is Aneta Corsaut who later had a long career in television with co-starring roles on the "Andy Griffith Show" and "Matlock." McQueen, one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars of the 1960s and 1970s, died at the age of 50 in 1980. He was a one-of-a-kind actor and personality who marched to his own beat,to say the least. Late in his career, McQueen was asked about having any regrets and answered "I should have taken the offer for 10% of "The Blob."

    Opening with a saxophone-punctuated, little jazz/pop ditty (penned by Burt Bacharach) containing lyrics that go like this - "Beware of the blob! It creeps and leaps and glides and slides across the floor...." - You can bet that this super-schlocky, 1950s, teen, Sci-Fi/Horror flick is guaranteed to deliver (in all of its dead-seriousness) a literal score of priceless, unintentional laughs from start to finish.

    I really had such a great time watching this film. It is very interesting that this is the film debut of Steve McQueen, good old Steve, good old badass. A typical story of 50s SF... a meteor falls down in... America of course, it is actually a protoplasmic blob and it's hungry! And guess what, blob's favorite food is human flesh, wow... Of course, police would not believe a bunch of young kids, so the blob will spread and made a disaster in the small town. I found this film entertaining, funny and unusual. Why is that? Because it is pretty rare, the rare idea for a large jelly mass to spread all over and eats everything in it's path... We usually have monsters, giant insects... all that stuff... but a large jelly blob? No way! It's interesting that the sequel was released in 1971, but, it didn't do any good. This one is better. Go, Steve!

    When a meteorite crash spews forth a ravenous alien blob that devours everything it touches, a group of teens race to warn the disbelieving adults in town about the creature before it's rampage consumes the entire area. Not really all that great as I thought it would be, as there's some pretty big flaws to this one. One of the main ones here is due to the consistently irritating efforts of the film to stay with the teens and their lifestyle that serve almost no entertainment value since I don't enjoy that lifestyle at all, leaving the beginning to feel way too slowed down and convoluted, having to jump back into the plot almost an after-thought the way it's so clumsily handled because they're showcasing the teens rather than keeping the story moving. The attacks, though, are a lot of fun and generate some good suspense and action, particularly the finale in the diner where it seems to spread everywhere and resulting in lots of ways to go at the being, so it does save itself some particular points that way, but it could've had a lot more with a bit of reworking.

    "The Blob" is chiefly remembered now for launching Steve McQueen's career. Soon after the release of this film, he was offered the role of Josh Randall on the hit TV series "Wanted: Dead or Alive," and super-stardom was only a few years away. Here, billed as "Steven" McQueen, he leads a pack of teenagers who are determined to stop the Blob from devouring their small town. The main problem is that the authorities (i.e. the local police) refuse to believe their story about a "monster" killing people and think it's all a "gag." Hatched from a meteor, the Blob itself (with the help of about $100 worth of Special Effects) is a magnified slab of Jell-O that looks like it's been leftover from yesterday's desert menu. As the film progresses, it gets bigger and bigger and is soon eating up whole buildings. The 28-year-old McQueen, who's supposed to be a teenager himself in the movie, is smart enough to figure out that this evil hunk of space glob can't stand low temperatures. In no time, everyone in town is bombarding it with CO-2 Fire Extinguishers and putting it into the deep freeze. The best scene in the film is when the Blob attacks the downtown theater during a midnight showing of monster movies and the panicking and screaming (actually smiling and laughing) crowd comes running out into the street. "The Blob" was distributed by Paramount Pictures who quite rightly figured it would be a smash hit with teenagers and it certainly was all of that. Broke at the time, McQueen settled for a $3000 flat fee for his services although he was also offered 10% of the gross profits in lieu of any upfront money. That turned out to be a mistake. Also in the cast is Aneta Corsaut who later had a long career in television with co-starring roles on the "Andy Griffith Show" and "Matlock." McQueen, one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars of the 1960s and 1970s, died at the age of 50 in 1980. He was a one-of-a-kind actor and personality who marched to his own beat,to say the least. Late in his career, McQueen was asked about having any regrets and answered "I should have taken the offer for 10% of "The Blob."

    Opening with a saxophone-punctuated, little jazz/pop ditty (penned by Burt Bacharach) containing lyrics that go like this - "Beware of the blob! It creeps and leaps and glides and slides across the floor...." - You can bet that this super-schlocky, 1950s, teen, Sci-Fi/Horror flick is guaranteed to deliver (in all of its dead-seriousness) a literal score of priceless, unintentional laughs from start to finish. And laughs it certainly does produce - Even before the big-bad blob, in all of its gelatinous, cherry-colored glory, makes its first gooey screen-appearance. From its hilariously dumb dialog, to its totally wooden performances, to its goofy, low-budget special effects - The Blob is sure to please any hardcore fan of 1950s, B-movie junk. You can bet on that. I mean, how can you possibly go wrong with such wacky highlights that include the blob (growing bigger by the minute) attacking a petrified nurse in Dr. Hallen's office and the blob (now even bigger and meaner than you could ever imagine) invading the local movie theater during a midnight movie show, causing the piercing screams of sheer panic and horrified mayhem to prevail at full-throttle.

    The Blob is an average horror film with a good idea that is fun but doesn't go above and beyond to be impressive and make it a sure classic. An alien lifeform lands on Earth and consumes everything and gets bigger and bigger as it eats, causing panic among the towns citizens. Now the local townsfolk must stop this blob from destroying the town before everything there is consumed into a big blob. The film is a simple alien story and a fine story with some very interesting scenes but doesn't keep our interests throughout as it's story is dull with average characters. The film does have some very memorable scenes though like the movie theater scene when the blob enters and everything turns to mayhem and also when it enters the office and eats the man while he pounds violently against the shades and screaming in terror. An alien movie is not a bad idea for the time, but it is not a great idea for an alien as they could have gave it an eerie appearance like in War of the Worlds to make it spooky instead of lame. I found most of the scares to be dull and boring when it is supposed to be shocking and tense. The Blob is not a bad movie, and is fun when it is supposed to be scary, but it is average and not great. A good film. Grade: B

    Two young adults named "Steve Andrews" (Steve McQueen) and "Jane Martin" (Aneta Corsaut) are star-gazing late at night on the outskirts of town when they see what appears to be a meteor hit the earth not far from where they are parked. An old man living out in the woods also hears the meteor impact and goes to investigate. He finds what appears to be a large spoor of some kind and upon further inspection happens to get a gooey substance from the spoor on his hand. As the substance begins to grow the old man runs screaming into the road where Steve and Jane just happen to be driving. Realizing that he is in a great deal of pain they put him into the back of their car and race to the doctor's office in town. But even there the substance continues to grow and has now developed an insatiable appetite which threatens the entire town. Anyway, rather than divulge the entire story, I will just say that this was a movie produced back in the 50's which was tailor-made for the local drive-in on a Saturday night. Obviously, the special effects are extremely primitive by today's standards and the script was a little corny at times. Well, maybe more than a "little" corny. But this is still an entertaining movie all the same and I recommend it to those who are capable of making allowances.

    A young couple out for a night of fun get more than they bargained for when attacked by 'The Blob'. While taking a drive with his girlfriend Jane, Steve see's an old man in the road with something on his hand, begging for help. It all begins when something mysterious lands on Earth, a giant blob which resembles a jelly latches onto an old man's hand. When the couple take the man to the clinic, they think it's all over. But it's only the beginning. The blob completely consumes the man as well as the doctor and therefore grows bigger and bigger. Pretty soon it rolls around the little town, killing anything in sight. It's up to Steve, Jane and the police force to put an end to it's reign of terror before it consumes everyone. Watching 'The Blob' in 2013 made me realize that this 1958 film actually dates pretty well. The fashion and acting isn't all that different (or over the top) than what we see now. It's well acted with Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut leading the way, and I'm sure was genuinely creepy at the time it was released. There are quite a few tense moments in which the giant blob attacks the doctor and nurse at the local clinic, and then goes after movie-goers at a theatre! It was very well done, the director did a great job at creating panic and the sense of fear with the people in the town. It can get a little slow around the middle frame after a strong start, that's probably the film's biggest weakness. However, the ending scenes when it attacks at the theatre and the diner are worth sticking around for. I also liked that the entire movie takes place on one night, it helps it not drag on and on too much. Highly recommended "old time" monster movie. 8/10

I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot of fun and there were some really good decent funny moment in this B-movie and the movie was really paced well, a lot stuff happens and never dull moment to take you off screen., The only think that annoyed me a little boy, it so annoying the way he spoke were so bad, it liked it was forced, Other wises the acting was really good from the whole cast!

    What started as a cheap b-movie became a cult classic. The Blob reportedly cost as low as 110,000 dollars, a small budget even by 1958 standards. Released by Paramount, it went on to gross four million dollars. The reasons for this were a unique monster, a smart script, and good direction. Due to the low budget, the story takes place in a small town, whereas other monsters of the 1950s were rampaging through big cities like New York and Tokyo. It was filmed in several suburbs of eastern Pennsylvania. For example, the diner was in Downingtown, while the movie theater was in neighboring Phoenixville. The flesh-eating Blob from space has been described as an amoeba, slime, pudding, and even a giant wad of chewing gum. In reality it was silicone gel with purple dye. The special effects were impressive for the time and budget. We see the Blob move and seep through openings. Small at first, it grows larger with each victim it consumes, leaving no evidence. It also changes color from translucent to purplish, almost blood red. Eventually the Blob becomes large enough to send people screaming from a theater (People who saw this film in theaters must have been looking over their shoulders during that scene). By the film's climax, the oozing horror is so large that it envelopes a diner, trapping the people inside. Due to its malleable nature, physical attacks have no effect on the creature. Nor do fire, acid or electricity. Indeed, it seems that nothing on earth can destroy it. The only way to stop the Blob is to freeze it, and even then, it may thaw out eventually. Thus the film ends with a question mark, and leaves the door open for a sequel. There was also good acting from a cast of unknowns, including young Steve McQueen in a star-making performance. The Blob was not the first teen horror film, although it was the first fully in color. AIP's I was a Teenage Werewolf, which launched the career of another young actor named Michael Landon, preceded it by a year. The whole story takes place over one long night. At first the adults will not believe Steve and his girlfriend about the Blob, especially one cop who is prejudiced against teenagers. Luckily Lt. Dave (Earl Rowe) is more sympathetic. The film has flaws, such as the fact that McQueen was clearly not a teenager, and some extras can be seen smiling when they are supposed to be fleeing in terror. Nor was the creature completely original. There already was a similar monster in X the Unknown (1956), but the makers of The Blob went the extra step of filming it in color. There was also the short story Slime by Joseph Payne Brennan, first published in the March 1953 issue of Weird Tales. But Blob seems based on a 1950 newspaper story about a mysterious purple substance found by Philly police. The film had a campy sequel in 1972 and a gory remake in 1988.

    When a meteorite falls from the sky, a local hobo comes out to investigate unwisely trying to closely observe a glutinous substance dripping from within the rock's exterior. The substance soon covers the old man's hand and quickly starts eating away at his flesh. A teenage couple Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) happen upon the poor man and decide to transport him to the local doctor. Soon however the blubbering mass devours his first prey and readies itself to consume every human being in town! Thrown back into the age of closed sets and inventive, seldom convincing, SFX the original "Blob" movie, struggles with time, leaving it to be more of an oddity with a killer pudding, than a horrifying piece of fiction. Admittedly charming it fails either to intrigue or entice, leaving just tidbits of oddly cheesy social interaction, which truly outlive the movie's expiry date. A movie ultimately destined to be solely admired by aficionados of the era and the logic / technology of the time, but by no means even they can admit this to being a great piece of cinema. Nonetheless its goofy credentials bumped up with some shoddy filmmaking can still make it a fun watch for die hard horror fans, especially those inclined towards the olden times...

    When a meteorite falls from the sky, a local hobo comes out to investigate unwisely trying to closely observe a glutinous substance dripping from within the rock's exterior. The substance soon covers the old man's hand and quickly starts eating away at his flesh. A teenage couple Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) happen upon the poor man and decide to transport him to the local doctor. Soon however the blubbering mass devours his first prey and readies itself to consume every human being in town! Thrown back into the age of closed sets and inventive, seldom convincing, SFX the original "Blob" movie, struggles with time, leaving it to be more of an oddity with a killer pudding, than a horrifying piece of fiction. Admittedly charming it fails either to intrigue or entice, leaving just tidbits of oddly cheesy social interaction, which truly outlive the movie's expiry date. A movie ultimately destined to be solely admired by aficionados of the era and the logic / technology of the time, but by no means even they can admit this to being a great piece of cinema. Nonetheless its goofy credentials bumped up with some shoddy filmmaking can still make it a fun watch for die hard horror fans, especially those inclined towards the olden times...

    I really had such a great time watching this film. It is very interesting that this is the film debut of Steve McQueen, good old Steve, good old badass. A typical story of 50s SF... a meteor falls down in... America of course, it is actually a protoplasmic blob and it's hungry! And guess what, blob's favorite food is human flesh, wow... Of course, police would not believe a bunch of young kids, so the blob will spread and made a disaster in the small town. I found this film entertaining, funny and unusual. Why is that? Because it is pretty rare, the rare idea for a large jelly mass to spread all over and eats everything in it's path... We usually have monsters, giant insects... all that stuff... but a large jelly blob? No way! It's interesting that the sequel was released in 1971, but, it didn't do any good. This one is better. Go, Steve!

    When a meteorite crash spews forth a ravenous alien blob that devours everything it touches, a group of teens race to warn the disbelieving adults in town about the creature before it's rampage consumes the entire area. Not really all that great as I thought it would be, as there's some pretty big flaws to this one. One of the main ones here is due to the consistently irritating efforts of the film to stay with the teens and their lifestyle that serve almost no entertainment value since I don't enjoy that lifestyle at all, leaving the beginning to feel way too slowed down and convoluted, having to jump back into the plot almost an after-thought the way it's so clumsily handled because they're showcasing the teens rather than keeping the story moving. The attacks, though, are a lot of fun and generate some good suspense and action, particularly the finale in the diner where it seems to spread everywhere and resulting in lots of ways to go at the being, so it does save itself some particular points that way, but it could've had a lot more with a bit of reworking.

    "The Blob" is chiefly remembered now for launching Steve McQueen's career. Soon after the release of this film, he was offered the role of Josh Randall on the hit TV series "Wanted: Dead or Alive," and super-stardom was only a few years away. Here, billed as "Steven" McQueen, he leads a pack of teenagers who are determined to stop the Blob from devouring their small town. The main problem is that the authorities (i.e. the local police) refuse to believe their story about a "monster" killing people and think it's all a "gag." Hatched from a meteor, the Blob itself (with the help of about $100 worth of Special Effects) is a magnified slab of Jell-O that looks like it's been leftover from yesterday's desert menu. As the film progresses, it gets bigger and bigger and is soon eating up whole buildings. The 28-year-old McQueen, who's supposed to be a teenager himself in the movie, is smart enough to figure out that this evil hunk of space glob can't stand low temperatures. In no time, everyone in town is bombarding it with CO-2 Fire Extinguishers and putting it into the deep freeze. The best scene in the film is when the Blob attacks the downtown theater during a midnight showing of monster movies and the panicking and screaming (actually smiling and laughing) crowd comes running out into the street. "The Blob" was distributed by Paramount Pictures who quite rightly figured it would be a smash hit with teenagers and it certainly was all of that. Broke at the time, McQueen settled for a $3000 flat fee for his services although he was also offered 10% of the gross profits in lieu of any upfront money. That turned out to be a mistake. Also in the cast is Aneta Corsaut who later had a long career in television with co-starring roles on the "Andy Griffith Show" and "Matlock." McQueen, one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars of the 1960s and 1970s, died at the age of 50 in 1980. He was a one-of-a-kind actor and personality who marched to his own beat,to say the least. Late in his career, McQueen was asked about having any regrets and answered "I should have taken the offer for 10% of "The Blob."

    Opening with a saxophone-punctuated, little jazz/pop ditty (penned by Burt Bacharach) containing lyrics that go like this - "Beware of the blob! It creeps and leaps and glides and slides across the floor...." - You can bet that this super-schlocky, 1950s, teen, Sci-Fi/Horror flick is guaranteed to deliver (in all of its dead-seriousness) a literal score of priceless, unintentional laughs from start to finish. And laughs it certainly does produce - Even before the big-bad blob, in all of its gelatinous, cherry-colored glory, makes its first gooey screen-appearance. From its hilariously dumb dialog, to its totally wooden performances, to its goofy, low-budget special effects - The Blob is sure to please any hardcore fan of 1950s, B-movie junk. You can bet on that. I mean, how can you possibly go wrong with such wacky highlights that include the blob (growing bigger by the minute) attacking a petrified nurse in Dr. Hallen's office and the blob (now even bigger and meaner than you could ever imagine) invading the local movie theater during a midnight movie show, causing the piercing screams of sheer panic and horrified mayhem to prevail at full-throttle.

    The Blob is an average horror film with a good idea that is fun but doesn't go above and beyond to be impressive and make it a sure classic. An alien lifeform lands on Earth and consumes everything and gets bigger and bigger as it eats, causing panic among the towns citizens. Now the local townsfolk must stop this blob from destroying the town before everything there is consumed into a big blob. The film is a simple alien story and a fine story with some very interesting scenes but doesn't keep our interests throughout as it's story is dull with average characters. The film does have some very memorable scenes though like the movie theater scene when the blob enters and everything turns to mayhem and also when it enters the office and eats the man while he pounds violently against the shades and screaming in terror. An alien movie is not a bad idea for the time, but it is not a great idea for an alien as they could have gave it an eerie appearance like in War of the Worlds to make it spooky instead of lame. I found most of the scares to be dull and boring when it is supposed to be shocking and tense. The Blob is not a bad movie, and is fun when it is supposed to be scary, but it is average and not great. A good film. Grade: B

    Two young adults named "Steve Andrews" (Steve McQueen) and "Jane Martin" (Aneta Corsaut) are star-gazing late at night on the outskirts of town when they see what appears to be a meteor hit the earth not far from where they are parked. An old man living out in the woods also hears the meteor impact and goes to investigate. He finds what appears to be a large spoor of some kind and upon further inspection happens to get a gooey substance from the spoor on his hand. As the substance begins to grow the old man runs screaming into the road where Steve and Jane just happen to be driving. Realizing that he is in a great deal of pain they put him into the back of their car and race to the doctor's office in town. But even there the substance continues to grow and has now developed an insatiable appetite which threatens the entire town. Anyway, rather than divulge the entire story, I will just say that this was a movie produced back in the 50's which was tailor-made for the local drive-in on a Saturday night. Obviously, the special effects are extremely primitive by today's standards and the script was a little corny at times. Well, maybe more than a "little" corny. But this is still an entertaining movie all the same and I recommend it to those who are capable of making allowances.

    A young couple out for a night of fun get more than they bargained for when attacked by 'The Blob'. While taking a drive with his girlfriend Jane, Steve see's an old man in the road with something on his hand, begging for help. It all begins when something mysterious lands on Earth, a giant blob which resembles a jelly latches onto an old man's hand. When the couple take the man to the clinic, they think it's all over. But it's only the beginning. The blob completely consumes the man as well as the doctor and therefore grows bigger and bigger. Pretty soon it rolls around the little town, killing anything in sight. It's up to Steve, Jane and the police force to put an end to it's reign of terror before it consumes everyone. Watching 'The Blob' in 2013 made me realize that this 1958 film actually dates pretty well. The fashion and acting isn't all that different (or over the top) than what we see now. It's well acted with Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut leading the way, and I'm sure was genuinely creepy at the time it was released. There are quite a few tense moments in which the giant blob attacks the doctor and nurse at the local clinic, and then goes after movie-goers at a theatre! It was very well done, the director did a great job at creating panic and the sense of fear with the people in the town. It can get a little slow around the middle frame after a strong start, that's probably the film's biggest weakness. However, the ending scenes when it attacks at the theatre and the diner are worth sticking around for. I also liked that the entire movie takes place on one night, it helps it not drag on and on too much. Highly recommended "old time" monster movie. 8/10

    Not all that bad from black and white Colour, it worked better here, then The Night of the living dead (1968), which was better to see in Black and white. I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot of fun and there were some really good decent funny moment in this B-movie and the movie was really paced well, a lot stuff happens and never dull moment to take you off screen., The only think that annoyed me a little boy, it so annoying the way he spoke were so bad, it liked it was forced, Other wises the acting was really good from the whole cast! I really enjoyed this b-,movie I going to give it 7 out of 10

    What started as a cheap b-movie became a cult classic. The Blob reportedly cost as low as 110,000 dollars, a small budget even by 1958 standards. Released by Paramount, it went on to gross four million dollars. The reasons for this were a unique monster, a smart script, and good direction. Due to the low budget, the story takes place in a small town, whereas other monsters of the 1950s were rampaging through big cities like New York and Tokyo. It was filmed in several suburbs of eastern Pennsylvania. For example, the diner was in Downingtown, while the movie theater was in neighboring Phoenixville. The flesh-eating Blob from space has been described as an amoeba, slime, pudding, and even a giant wad of chewing gum. In reality it was silicone gel with purple dye. The special effects were impressive for the time and budget. We see the Blob move and seep through openings. Small at first, it grows larger with each victim it consumes, leaving no evidence. It also changes color from translucent to purplish, almost blood red. Eventually the Blob becomes large enough to send people screaming from a theater (People who saw this film in theaters must have been looking over their shoulders during that scene). By the film's climax, the oozing horror is so large that it envelopes a diner, trapping the people inside. Due to its malleable nature, physical attacks have no effect on the creature. Nor do fire, acid or electricity. Indeed, it seems that nothing on earth can destroy it. The only way to stop the Blob is to freeze it, and even then, it may thaw out eventually. Thus the film ends with a question mark, and leaves the door open for a sequel. There was also good acting from a cast of unknowns, including young Steve McQueen in a star-making performance. The Blob was not the first teen horror film, although it was the first fully in color. AIP's I was a Teenage Werewolf, which launched the career of another young actor named Michael Landon, preceded it by a year. The whole story takes place over one long night. At first the adults will not believe Steve and his girlfriend about the Blob, especially one cop who is prejudiced against teenagers. Luckily Lt. Dave (Earl Rowe) is more sympathetic. The film has flaws, such as the fact that McQueen was clearly not a teenager, and some extras can be seen smiling when they are supposed to be fleeing in terror. Nor was the creature completely original. There already was a similar monster in X the Unknown (1956), but the makers of The Blob went the extra step of filming it in color. There was also the short story Slime by Joseph Payne Brennan, first published in the March 1953 issue of Weird Tales. But Blob seems based on a 1950 newspaper story about a mysterious purple substance found by Philly police. The film had a campy sequel in 1972 and a gory remake in 1988.

    Not all that bad from black and white Colour, it worked better here, then The Night of the living dead (1968), which was better to see in Black and white. I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot of fun and there were some really good decent funny moment in this B-movie and the movie was really paced well, a lot stuff happens and never dull moment to take you off screen., The only think that annoyed me a little boy, it so annoying the way he spoke were so bad, it liked it was forced, Other wises the acting was really good from the whole cast! I really enjoyed this b-,movie I going to give it 7 out of 10

    What started as a cheap b-movie became a cult classic. The Blob reportedly cost as low as 110,000 dollars, a small budget even by 1958 standards. Released by Paramount, it went on to gross four million dollars. The reasons for this were a unique monster, a smart script, and good direction. Due to the low budget, the story takes place in a small town, whereas other monsters of the 1950s were rampaging through big cities like New York and Tokyo. It was filmed in several suburbs of eastern Pennsylvania. For example, the diner was in Downingtown, while the movie theater was in neighboring Phoenixville. The flesh-eating Blob from space has been described as an amoeba, slime, pudding, and even a giant wad of chewing gum. In reality it was silicone gel with purple dye. The special effects were impressive for the time and budget. We see the Blob move and seep through openings. Small at first, it grows larger with each victim it consumes, leaving no evidence. It also changes color from translucent to purplish, almost blood red. Eventually the Blob becomes large enough to send people screaming from a theater (People who saw this film in theaters must have been looking over their shoulders during that scene). By the film's climax, the oozing horror is so large that it envelopes a diner, trapping the people inside. Due to its malleable nature, physical attacks have no effect on the creature. Nor do fire, acid or electricity. Indeed, it seems that nothing on earth can destroy it. The only way to stop the Blob is to freeze it, and even then, it may thaw out eventually. Thus the film ends with a question mark, and leaves the door open for a sequel. There was also good acting from a cast of unknowns, including young Steve McQueen in a star-making performance. The Blob was not the first teen horror film, although it was the first fully in color. AIP's I was a Teenage Werewolf, which launched the career of another young actor named Michael Landon, preceded it by a year. The whole story takes place over one long night. At first the adults will not believe Steve and his girlfriend about the Blob, especially one cop who is prejudiced against teenagers. Luckily Lt. Dave (Earl Rowe) is more sympathetic. The film has flaws, such as the fact that McQueen was clearly not a teenager, and some extras can be seen smiling when they are supposed to be fleeing in terror. Nor was the creature completely original. There already was a similar monster in X the Unknown (1956), but the makers of The Blob went the extra step of filming it in color. There was also the short story Slime by Joseph Payne Brennan, first published in the March 1953 issue of Weird Tales. But Blob seems based on a 1950 newspaper story about a mysterious purple substance found by Philly police. The film had a campy sequel in 1972 and a gory remake in 1988.

    When a meteorite falls from the sky, a local hobo comes out to investigate unwisely trying to closely observe a glutinous substance dripping from within the rock's exterior. The substance soon covers the old man's hand and quickly starts eating away at his flesh. A teenage couple Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) happen upon the poor man and decide to transport him to the local doctor. Soon however the blubbering mass devours his first prey and readies itself to consume every human being in town! Thrown back into the age of closed sets and inventive, seldom convincing, SFX the original "Blob" movie, struggles with time, leaving it to be more of an oddity with a killer pudding, than a horrifying piece of fiction. Admittedly charming it fails either to intrigue or entice, leaving just tidbits of oddly cheesy social interaction, which truly outlive the movie's expiry date. A movie ultimately destined to be solely admired by aficionados of the era and the logic / technology of the time, but by no means even they can admit this to being a great piece of cinema. Nonetheless its goofy credentials bumped up with some shoddy filmmaking can still make it a fun watch for die hard horror fans, especially those inclined towards the olden times...

    I really had such a great time watching this film. It is very interesting that this is the film debut of Steve McQueen, good old Steve, good old badass. A typical story of 50s SF... a meteor falls down in... America of course, it is actually a protoplasmic blob and it's hungry! And guess what, blob's favorite food is human flesh, wow... Of course, police would not believe a bunch of young kids, so the blob will spread and made a disaster in the small town. I found this film entertaining, funny and unusual. Why is that? Because it is pretty rare, the rare idea for a large jelly mass to spread all over and eats everything in it's path... We usually have monsters, giant insects... all that stuff... but a large jelly blob? No way! It's interesting that the sequel was released in 1971, but, it didn't do any good. This one is better. Go, Steve!

    When a meteorite crash spews forth a ravenous alien blob that devours everything it touches, a group of teens race to warn the disbelieving adults in town about the creature before it's rampage consumes the entire area. Not really all that great as I thought it would be, as there's some pretty big flaws to this one. One of the main ones here is due to the consistently irritating efforts of the film to stay with the teens and their lifestyle that serve almost no entertainment value since I don't enjoy that lifestyle at all, leaving the beginning to feel way too slowed down and convoluted, having to jump back into the plot almost an after-thought the way it's so clumsily handled because they're showcasing the teens rather than keeping the story moving. The attacks, though, are a lot of fun and generate some good suspense and action, particularly the finale in the diner where it seems to spread everywhere and resulting in lots of ways to go at the being, so it does save itself some particular points that way, but it could've had a lot more with a bit of reworking.

    "The Blob" is chiefly remembered now for launching Steve McQueen's career. Soon after the release of this film, he was offered the role of Josh Randall on the hit TV series "Wanted: Dead or Alive," and super-stardom was only a few years away. Here, billed as "Steven" McQueen, he leads a pack of teenagers who are determined to stop the Blob from devouring their small town. The main problem is that the authorities (i.e. the local police) refuse to believe their story about a "monster" killing people and think it's all a "gag." Hatched from a meteor, the Blob itself (with the help of about $100 worth of Special Effects) is a magnified slab of Jell-O that looks like it's been leftover from yesterday's desert menu. As the film progresses, it gets bigger and bigger and is soon eating up whole buildings. The 28-year-old McQueen, who's supposed to be a teenager himself in the movie, is smart enough to figure out that this evil hunk of space glob can't stand low temperatures. In no time, everyone in town is bombarding it with CO-2 Fire Extinguishers and putting it into the deep freeze. The best scene in the film is when the Blob attacks the downtown theater during a midnight showing of monster movies and the panicking and screaming (actually smiling and laughing) crowd comes running out into the street. "The Blob" was distributed by Paramount Pictures who quite rightly figured it would be a smash hit with teenagers and it certainly was all of that. Broke at the time, McQueen settled for a $3000 flat fee for his services although he was also offered 10% of the gross profits in lieu of any upfront money. That turned out to be a mistake. Also in the cast is Aneta Corsaut who later had a long career in television with co-starring roles on the "Andy Griffith Show" and "Matlock." McQueen, one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars of the 1960s and 1970s, died at the age of 50 in 1980. He was a one-of-a-kind actor and personality who marched to his own beat,to say the least. Late in his career, McQueen was asked about having any regrets and answered "I should have taken the offer for 10% of "The Blob."

    Opening with a saxophone-punctuated, little jazz/pop ditty (penned by Burt Bacharach) containing lyrics that go like this - "Beware of the blob! It creeps and leaps and glides and slides across the floor...." - You can bet that this super-schlocky, 1950s, teen, Sci-Fi/Horror flick is guaranteed to deliver (in all of its dead-seriousness) a literal score of priceless, unintentional laughs from start to finish. And laughs it certainly does produce - Even before the big-bad blob, in all of its gelatinous, cherry-colored glory, makes its first gooey screen-appearance. From its hilariously dumb dialog, to its totally wooden performances, to its goofy, low-budget special effects - The Blob is sure to please any hardcore fan of 1950s, B-movie junk. You can bet on that. I mean, how can you possibly go wrong with such wacky highlights that include the blob (growing bigger by the minute) attacking a petrified nurse in Dr. Hallen's office and the blob (now even bigger and meaner than you could ever imagine) invading the local movie theater during a midnight movie show, causing the piercing screams of sheer panic and horrified mayhem to prevail at full-throttle.

    The Blob is an average horror film with a good idea that is fun but doesn't go above and beyond to be impressive and make it a sure classic. An alien lifeform lands on Earth and consumes everything and gets bigger and bigger as it eats, causing panic among the towns citizens. Now the local townsfolk must stop this blob from destroying the town before everything there is consumed into a big blob. The film is a simple alien story and a fine story with some very interesting scenes but doesn't keep our interests throughout as it's story is dull with average characters. The film does have some very memorable scenes though like the movie theater scene when the blob enters and everything turns to mayhem and also when it enters the office and eats the man while he pounds violently against the shades and screaming in terror. An alien movie is not a bad idea for the time, but it is not a great idea for an alien as they could have gave it an eerie appearance like in War of the Worlds to make it spooky instead of lame. I found most of the scares to be dull and boring when it is supposed to be shocking and tense. The Blob is not a bad movie, and is fun when it is supposed to be scary, but it is average and not great. A good film. Grade: B

    Two young adults named "Steve Andrews" (Steve McQueen) and "Jane Martin" (Aneta Corsaut) are star-gazing late at night on the outskirts of town when they see what appears to be a meteor hit the earth not far from where they are parked. An old man living out in the woods also hears the meteor impact and goes to investigate. He finds what appears to be a large spoor of some kind and upon further inspection happens to get a gooey substance from the spoor on his hand. As the substance begins to grow the old man runs screaming into the road where Steve and Jane just happen to be driving. Realizing that he is in a great deal of pain they put him into the back of their car and race to the doctor's office in town. But even there the substance continues to grow and has now developed an insatiable appetite which threatens the entire town. Anyway, rather than divulge the entire story, I will just say that this was a movie produced back in the 50's which was tailor-made for the local drive-in on a Saturday night. Obviously, the special effects are extremely primitive by today's standards and the script was a little corny at times. Well, maybe more than a "little" corny. But this is still an entertaining movie all the same and I recommend it to those who are capable of making allowances.

    A young couple out for a night of fun get more than they bargained for when attacked by 'The Blob'. While taking a drive with his girlfriend Jane, Steve see's an old man in the road with something on his hand, begging for help. It all begins when something mysterious lands on Earth, a giant blob which resembles a jelly latches onto an old man's hand. When the couple take the man to the clinic, they think it's all over. But it's only the beginning. The blob completely consumes the man as well as the doctor and therefore grows bigger and bigger. Pretty soon it rolls around the little town, killing anything in sight. It's up to Steve, Jane and the police force to put an end to it's reign of terror before it consumes everyone. Watching 'The Blob' in 2013 made me realize that this 1958 film actually dates pretty well. The fashion and acting isn't all that different (or over the top) than what we see now. It's well acted with Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut leading the way, and I'm sure was genuinely creepy at the time it was released. There are quite a few tense moments in which the giant blob attacks the doctor and nurse at the local clinic, and then goes after movie-goers at a theatre! It was very well done, the director did a great job at creating panic and the sense of fear with the people in the town. It can get a little slow around the middle frame after a strong start, that's probably the film's biggest weakness. However, the ending scenes when it attacks at the theatre and the diner are worth sticking around for. I also liked that the entire movie takes place on one night, it helps it not drag on and on too much. Highly recommended "old time" monster movie. 8/10

There was also the short story Slime by Joseph Payne Brennan, first published in the March 1953 issue of Weird Tales.

As the substance begins to grow the old man runs screaming into the road where Steve and Jane just happen to be driving. Realizing that he is in a great deal of pain they put him into the back of their car and race to the doctor's office in town. But even there the substance continues to grow and has now developed an insatiable appetite which threatens the entire town. Anyway, rather than divulge the entire story, I will just say that this was a movie produced back in the 50's which was tailor-made for the local drive-in on a Saturday night. Obviously, the special effects are extremely primitive by today's standards and the script was a little corny at times. Well, maybe more than a "little" corny. But this is still an entertaining movie all the same and I recommend it to those who are capable of making allowances.

    A young couple out for a night of fun get more than they bargained for when attacked by 'The Blob'. While taking a drive with his girlfriend Jane, Steve see's an old man in the road with something on his hand, begging for help. It all begins when something mysterious lands on Earth, a giant blob which resembles a jelly latches onto an old man's hand. When the couple take the man to the clinic, they think it's all over. But it's only the beginning. The blob completely consumes the man as well as the doctor and therefore grows bigger and bigger. Pretty soon it rolls around the little town, killing anything in sight. It's up to Steve, Jane and the police force to put an end to it's reign of terror before it consumes everyone. Watching 'The Blob' in 2013 made me realize that this 1958 film actually dates pretty well. The fashion and acting isn't all that different (or over the top) than what we see now. It's well acted with Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut leading the way, and I'm sure was genuinely creepy at the time it was released. There are quite a few tense moments in which the giant blob attacks the doctor and nurse at the local clinic, and then goes after movie-goers at a theatre! It was very well done, the director did a great job at creating panic and the sense of fear with the people in the town. It can get a little slow around the middle frame after a strong start, that's probably the film's biggest weakness. However, the ending scenes when it attacks at the theatre and the diner are worth sticking around for. I also liked that the entire movie takes place on one night, it helps it not drag on and on too much. Highly recommended "old time" monster movie. 8/10

    Not all that bad from black and white Colour, it worked better here, then The Night of the living dead (1968), which was better to see in Black and white. I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot of fun and there were some really good decent funny moment in this B-movie and the movie was really paced well, a lot stuff happens and never dull moment to take you off screen., The only think that annoyed me a little boy, it so annoying the way he spoke were so bad, it liked it was forced, Other wises the acting was really good from the whole cast! I really enjoyed this b-,movie I going to give it 7 out of 10

    What started as a cheap b-movie became a cult classic. The Blob reportedly cost as low as 110,000 dollars, a small budget even by 1958 standards. Released by Paramount, it went on to gross four million dollars. The reasons for this were a unique monster, a smart script, and good direction. Due to the low budget, the story takes place in a small town, whereas other monsters of the 1950s were rampaging through big cities like New York and Tokyo. It was filmed in several suburbs of eastern Pennsylvania. For example, the diner was in Downingtown, while the movie theater was in neighboring Phoenixville. The flesh-eating Blob from space has been described as an amoeba, slime, pudding, and even a giant wad of chewing gum. In reality it was silicone gel with purple dye. The special effects were impressive for the time and budget. We see the Blob move and seep through openings. Small at first, it grows larger with each victim it consumes, leaving no evidence. It also changes color from translucent to purplish, almost blood red. Eventually the Blob becomes large enough to send people screaming from a theater (People who saw this film in theaters must have been looking over their shoulders during that scene). By the film's climax, the oozing horror is so large that it envelopes a diner, trapping the people inside. Due to its malleable nature, physical attacks have no effect on the creature. Nor do fire, acid or electricity. Indeed, it seems that nothing on earth can destroy it. The only way to stop the Blob is to freeze it, and even then, it may thaw out eventually. Thus the film ends with a question mark, and leaves the door open for a sequel. There was also good acting from a cast of unknowns, including young Steve McQueen in a star-making performance. The Blob was not the first teen horror film, although it was the first fully in color. AIP's I was a Teenage Werewolf, which launched the career of another young actor named Michael Landon, preceded it by a year. The whole story takes place over one long night. At first the adults will not believe Steve and his girlfriend about the Blob, especially one cop who is prejudiced against teenagers. Luckily Lt. Dave (Earl Rowe) is more sympathetic. The film has flaws, such as the fact that McQueen was clearly not a teenager, and some extras can be seen smiling when they are supposed to be fleeing in terror. Nor was the creature completely original. There already was a similar monster in X the Unknown (1956), but the makers of The Blob went the extra step of filming it in color. There was also the short story Slime by Joseph Payne Brennan, first published in the March 1953 issue of Weird Tales. But Blob seems based on a 1950 newspaper story about a mysterious purple substance found by Philly police. The film had a campy sequel in 1972 and a gory remake in 1988.

    When a meteorite falls from the sky, a local hobo comes out to investigate unwisely trying to closely observe a glutinous substance dripping from within the rock's exterior. The substance soon covers the old man's hand and quickly starts eating away at his flesh. A teenage couple Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) happen upon the poor man and decide to transport him to the local doctor. Soon however the blubbering mass devours his first prey and readies itself to consume every human being in town! Thrown back into the age of closed sets and inventive, seldom convincing, SFX the original "Blob" movie, struggles with time, leaving it to be more of an oddity with a killer pudding, than a horrifying piece of fiction. Admittedly charming it fails either to intrigue or entice, leaving just tidbits of oddly cheesy social interaction, which truly outlive the movie's expiry date. A movie ultimately destined to be solely admired by aficionados of the era and the logic / technology of the time, but by no means even they can admit this to being a great piece of cinema.

    I really had such a great time watching this film. It is very interesting that this is the film debut of Steve McQueen, good old Steve, good old badass. A typical story of 50s SF... a meteor falls down in... America of course, it is actually a protoplasmic blob and it's hungry! And guess what, blob's favorite food is human flesh, wow... Of course, police would not believe a bunch of young kids, so the blob will spread and made a disaster in the small town. I found this film entertaining, funny and unusual. Why is that? Because it is pretty rare, the rare idea for a large jelly mass to spread all over and eats everything in it's path... We usually have monsters, giant insects... all that stuff... but a large jelly blob? No way! It's interesting that the sequel was released in 1971, but, it didn't do any good. This one is better. Go, Steve!

    When a meteorite crash spews forth a ravenous alien blob that devours everything it touches, a group of teens race to warn the disbelieving adults in town about the creature before it's rampage consumes the entire area. Not really all that great as I thought it would be, as there's some pretty big flaws to this one. One of the main ones here is due to the consistently irritating efforts of the film to stay with the teens and their lifestyle that serve almost no entertainment value since I don't enjoy that lifestyle at all, leaving the beginning to feel way too slowed down and convoluted, having to jump back into the plot almost an after-thought the way it's so clumsily handled because they're showcasing the teens rather than keeping the story moving. The attacks, though, are a lot of fun and generate some good suspense and action, particularly the finale in the diner where it seems to spread everywhere and resulting in lots of ways to go at the being, so it does save itself some particular points that way, but it could've had a lot more with a bit of reworking.

    "The Blob" is chiefly remembered now for launching Steve McQueen's career. Soon after the release of this film, he was offered the role of Josh Randall on the hit TV series "Wanted: Dead or Alive," and super-stardom was only a few years away. Here, billed as "Steven" McQueen, he leads a pack of teenagers who are determined to stop the Blob from devouring their small town. The main problem is that the authorities (i.e. the local police) refuse to believe their story about a "monster" killing people and think it's all a "gag." Hatched from a meteor, the Blob itself (with the help of about $100 worth of Special Effects) is a magnified slab of Jell-O that looks like it's been leftover from yesterday's desert menu. As the film progresses, it gets bigger and bigger and is soon eating up whole buildings. The 28-year-old McQueen, who's supposed to be a teenager himself in the movie, is smart enough to figure out that this evil hunk of space glob can't stand low temperatures. In no time, everyone in town is bombarding it with CO-2 Fire Extinguishers and putting it into the deep freeze. The best scene in the film is when the Blob attacks the downtown theater during a midnight showing of monster movies and the panicking and screaming (actually smiling and laughing) crowd comes running out into the street. "The Blob" was distributed by Paramount Pictures who quite rightly figured it would be a smash hit with teenagers and it certainly was all of that. Broke at the time, McQueen settled for a $3000 flat fee for his services although he was also offered 10% of the gross profits in lieu of any upfront money. That turned out to be a mistake. Also in the cast is Aneta Corsaut who later had a long career in television with co-starring roles on the "Andy Griffith Show" and "Matlock." McQueen, one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars of the 1960s and 1970s, died at the age of 50 in 1980. He was a one-of-a-kind actor and personality who marched to his own beat,to say the least. Late in his career, McQueen was asked about having any regrets and answered "I should have taken the offer for 10% of "The Blob."

    Opening with a saxophone-punctuated, little jazz/pop ditty (penned by Burt Bacharach) containing lyrics that go like this - "Beware of the blob! It creeps and leaps and glides and slides across the floor...." - You can bet that this super-schlocky, 1950s, teen, Sci-Fi/Horror flick is guaranteed to deliver (in all of its dead-seriousness) a literal score of priceless, unintentional laughs from start to finish. And laughs it certainly does produce - Even before the big-bad blob, in all of its gelatinous, cherry-colored glory, makes its first gooey screen-appearance. From its hilariously dumb dialog, to its totally wooden performances, to its goofy, low-budget special effects - The Blob is sure to please any hardcore fan of 1950s, B-movie junk. You can bet on that. I mean, how can you possibly go wrong with such wacky highlights that include the blob (growing bigger by the minute) attacking a petrified nurse in Dr. Hallen's office and the blob (now even bigger and meaner than you could ever imagine) invading the local movie theater during a midnight movie show, causing the piercing screams of sheer panic and horrified mayhem to prevail at full-throttle.

    The Blob is an average horror film with a good idea that is fun but doesn't go above and beyond to be impressive and make it a sure classic. An alien lifeform lands on Earth and consumes everything and gets bigger and bigger as it eats, causing panic among the towns citizens. Now the local townsfolk must stop this blob from destroying the town before everything there is consumed into a big blob. The film is a simple alien story and a fine story with some very interesting scenes but doesn't keep our interests throughout as it's story is dull with average characters. The film does have some very memorable scenes though like the movie theater scene when the blob enters and everything turns to mayhem and also when it enters the office and eats the man while he pounds violently against the shades and screaming in terror. An alien movie is not a bad idea for the time, but it is not a great idea for an alien as they could have gave it an eerie appearance like in War of the Worlds to make it spooky instead of lame. I found most of the scares to be dull and boring when it is supposed to be shocking and tense. The Blob is not a bad movie, and is fun when it is supposed to be scary, but it is average and not great. A good film. Grade: B

    Two young adults named "Steve Andrews" (Steve McQueen) and "Jane Martin" (Aneta Corsaut) are star-gazing late at night on the outskirts of town when they see what appears to be a meteor hit the earth not far from where they are parked. An old man living out in the woods also hears the meteor impact and goes to investigate. He finds what appears to be a large spoor of some kind and upon further inspection happens to get a gooey substance from the spoor on his hand. As the substance begins to grow the old man runs screaming into the road where Steve and Jane just happen to be driving. Realizing that he is in a great deal of pain they put him into the back of their car and race to the doctor's office in town. But even there the substance continues to grow and has now developed an insatiable appetite which threatens the entire town. Anyway, rather than divulge the entire story, I will just say that this was a movie produced back in the 50's which was tailor-made for the local drive-in on a Saturday night. Obviously, the special effects are extremely primitive by today's standards and the script was a little corny at times. Well, maybe more than a "little" corny. But this is still an entertaining movie all the same and I recommend it to those who are capable of making allowances.

And laughs it certainly does produce - Even before the big-bad blob, in all of its gelatinous, cherry-colored glory, makes its first gooey screen-appearance. From its hilariously dumb dialog, to its totally wooden performances, to its goofy, low-budget special effects - The Blob is sure to please any hardcore fan of 1950s, B-movie junk. You can bet on that. I mean, how can you possibly go wrong with such wacky highlights that include the blob (growing bigger by the minute) attacking a petrified nurse in Dr. Hallen's office and the blob (now even bigger and meaner than you could ever imagine) invading the local movie theater during a midnight movie show, causing the piercing screams of sheer panic and horrified mayhem to prevail at full-throttle.

    The Blob is an average horror film with a good idea that is fun but doesn't go above and beyond to be impressive and make it a sure classic. An alien lifeform lands on Earth and consumes everything and gets bigger and bigger as it eats, causing panic among the towns citizens. Now the local townsfolk must stop this blob from destroying the town before everything there is consumed into a big blob. The film is a simple alien story and a fine story with some very interesting scenes but doesn't keep our interests throughout as it's story is dull with average characters. The film does have some very memorable scenes though like the movie theater scene when the blob enters and everything turns to mayhem and also when it enters the office and eats the man while he pounds violently against the shades and screaming in terror. An alien movie is not a bad idea for the time, but it is not a great idea for an alien as they could have gave it an eerie appearance like in War of the Worlds to make it spooky instead of lame. I found most of the scares to be dull and boring when it is supposed to be shocking and tense. The Blob is not a bad movie, and is fun when it is supposed to be scary, but it is average and not great. A good film. Grade: B

    Two young adults named "Steve Andrews" (Steve McQueen) and "Jane Martin" (Aneta Corsaut) are star-gazing late at night on the outskirts of town when they see what appears to be a meteor hit the earth not far from where they are parked. An old man living out in the woods also hears the meteor impact and goes to investigate. He finds what appears to be a large spoor of some kind and upon further inspection happens to get a gooey substance from the spoor on his hand. As the substance begins to grow the old man runs screaming into the road where Steve and Jane just happen to be driving. Realizing that he is in a great deal of pain they put him into the back of their car and race to the doctor's office in town. But even there the substance continues to grow and has now developed an insatiable appetite which threatens the entire town. Anyway, rather than divulge the entire story, I will just say that this was a movie produced back in the 50's which was tailor-made for the local drive-in on a Saturday night. Obviously, the special effects are extremely primitive by today's standards and the script was a little corny at times. Well, maybe more than a "little" corny. But this is still an entertaining movie all the same and I recommend it to those who are capable of making allowances.

    A young couple out for a night of fun get more than they bargained for when attacked by 'The Blob'. While taking a drive with his girlfriend Jane, Steve see's an old man in the road with something on his hand, begging for help. It all begins when something mysterious lands on Earth, a giant blob which resembles a jelly latches onto an old man's hand. When the couple take the man to the clinic, they think it's all over. But it's only the beginning. The blob completely consumes the man as well as the doctor and therefore grows bigger and bigger. Pretty soon it rolls around the little town, killing anything in sight. It's up to Steve, Jane and the police force to put an end to it's reign of terror before it consumes everyone. Watching 'The Blob' in 2013 made me realize that this 1958 film actually dates pretty well. The fashion and acting isn't all that different (or over the top) than what we see now. It's well acted with Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut leading the way, and I'm sure was genuinely creepy at the time it was released. There are quite a few tense moments in which the giant blob attacks the doctor and nurse at the local clinic, and then goes after movie-goers at a theatre! It was very well done, the director did a great job at creating panic and the sense of fear with the people in the town. It can get a little slow around the middle frame after a strong start, that's probably the film's biggest weakness. However, the ending scenes when it attacks at the theatre and the diner are worth sticking around for. I also liked that the entire movie takes place on one night, it helps it not drag on and on too much. Highly recommended "old time" monster movie. 8/10

    Not all that bad from black and white Colour, it worked better here, then The Night of the living dead (1968), which was better to see in Black and white. I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot of fun and there were some really good decent funny moment in this B-movie and the movie was really paced well, a lot stuff happens and never dull moment to take you off screen., The only think that annoyed me a little boy, it so annoying the way he spoke were so bad, it liked it was forced, Other wises the acting was really good from the whole cast! I really enjoyed this b-,movie I going to give it 7 out of 10

    What started as a cheap b-movie became a cult classic. The Blob reportedly cost as low as 110,000 dollars, a small budget even by 1958 standards. Released by Paramount, it went on to gross four million dollars. The reasons for this were a unique monster, a smart script, and good direction. Due to the low budget, the story takes place in a small town, whereas other monsters of the 1950s were rampaging through big cities like New York and Tokyo. It was filmed in several suburbs of eastern Pennsylvania. For example, the diner was in Downingtown, while the movie theater was in neighboring Phoenixville. The flesh-eating Blob from space has been described as an amoeba, slime, pudding, and even a giant wad of chewing gum. In reality it was silicone gel with purple dye. The special effects were impressive for the time and budget. We see the Blob move and seep through openings. Small at first, it grows larger with each victim it consumes, leaving no evidence. It also changes color from translucent to purplish, almost blood red. Eventually the Blob becomes large enough to send people screaming from a theater (People who saw this film in theaters must have been looking over their shoulders during that scene). By the film's climax, the oozing horror is so large that it envelopes a diner, trapping the people inside. Due to its malleable nature, physical attacks have no effect on the creature. Nor do fire, acid or electricity. Indeed, it seems that nothing on earth can destroy it. The only way to stop the Blob is to freeze it, and even then, it may thaw out eventually. Thus the film ends with a question mark, and leaves the door open for a sequel. There was also good acting from a cast of unknowns, including young Steve McQueen in a star-making performance. The Blob was not the first teen horror film, although it was the first fully in color. AIP's I was a Teenage Werewolf, which launched the career of another young actor named Michael Landon, preceded it by a year. The whole story takes place over one long night. At first the adults will not believe Steve and his girlfriend about the Blob, especially one cop who is prejudiced against teenagers. Luckily Lt. Dave (Earl Rowe) is more sympathetic. The film has flaws, such as the fact that McQueen was clearly not a teenager, and some extras can be seen smiling when they are supposed to be fleeing in terror. Nor was the creature completely original. There already was a similar monster in X the Unknown (1956), but the makers of The Blob went the extra step of filming it in color. There was also the short story Slime by Joseph Payne Brennan, first published in the March 1953 issue of Weird Tales. But Blob seems based on a 1950 newspaper story about a mysterious purple substance found by Philly police. The film had a campy sequel in 1972 and a gory remake in 1988.

    When a meteorite falls from the sky, a local hobo comes out to investigate unwisely trying to closely observe a glutinous substance dripping from within the rock's exterior. The substance soon covers the old man's hand and quickly starts eating away at his flesh. A teenage couple Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) happen upon the poor man and decide to transport him to the local doctor. Soon however the blubbering mass devours his first prey and readies itself to consume every human being in town! Thrown back into the age of closed sets and inventive, seldom convincing, SFX the original "Blob" movie, struggles with time, leaving it to be more of an oddity with a killer pudding, than a horrifying piece of fiction. Admittedly charming it fails either to intrigue or entice, leaving just tidbits of oddly cheesy social interaction, which truly outlive the movie's expiry date. A movie ultimately destined to be solely admired by aficionados of the era and the logic / technology of the time, but by no means even they can admit this to being a great piece of cinema. Nonetheless its goofy credentials bumped up with some shoddy filmmaking can still make it a fun watch for die hard horror fans, especially those inclined towards the olden times...

    I really had such a great time watching this film. It is very interesting that this is the film debut of Steve McQueen, good old Steve, good old badass. A typical story of 50s SF... a meteor falls down in... America of course, it is actually a protoplasmic blob and it's hungry! And guess what, blob's favorite food is human flesh, wow... Of course, police would not believe a bunch of young kids, so the blob will spread and made a disaster in the small town. I found this film entertaining, funny and unusual. Why is that? Because it is pretty rare, the rare idea for a large jelly mass to spread all over and eats everything in it's path... We usually have monsters, giant insects... all that stuff... but a large jelly blob? No way! It's interesting that the sequel was released in 1971, but, it didn't do any good. This one is better. Go, Steve!

    When a meteorite crash spews forth a ravenous alien blob that devours everything it touches, a group of teens race to warn the disbelieving adults in town about the creature before it's rampage consumes the entire area. Not really all that great as I thought it would be, as there's some pretty big flaws to this one. One of the main ones here is due to the consistently irritating efforts of the film to stay with the teens and their lifestyle that serve almost no entertainment value since I don't enjoy that lifestyle at all, leaving the beginning to feel way too slowed down and convoluted, having to jump back into the plot almost an after-thought the way it's so clumsily handled because they're showcasing the teens rather than keeping the story moving. The attacks, though, are a lot of fun and generate some good suspense and action, particularly the finale in the diner where it seems to spread everywhere and resulting in lots of ways to go at the being, so it does save itself some particular points that way, but it could've had a lot more with a bit of reworking. Today's Rating/PG: Violence

    "The Blob" is chiefly remembered now for launching Steve McQueen's career. Soon after the release of this film, he was offered the role of Josh Randall on the hit TV series "Wanted: Dead or Alive," and super-stardom was only a few years away. Here, billed as "Steven" McQueen, he leads a pack of teenagers who are determined to stop the Blob from devouring their small town. The main problem is that the authorities (i.e. the local police) refuse to believe their story about a "monster" killing people and think it's all a "gag." Hatched from a meteor, the Blob itself (with the help of about $100 worth of Special Effects) is a magnified slab of Jell-O that looks like it's been leftover from yesterday's desert menu. As the film progresses, it gets bigger and bigger and is soon eating up whole buildings. The 28-year-old McQueen, who's supposed to be a teenager himself in the movie, is smart enough to figure out that this evil hunk of space glob can't stand low temperatures. In no time, everyone in town is bombarding it with CO-2 Fire Extinguishers and putting it into the deep freeze. The best scene in the film is when the Blob attacks the downtown theater during a midnight showing of monster movies and the panicking and screaming (actually smiling and laughing) crowd comes running out into the street. "The Blob" was distributed by Paramount Pictures who quite rightly figured it would be a smash hit with teenagers and it certainly was all of that. Broke at the time, McQueen settled for a $3000 flat fee for his services although he was also offered 10% of the gross profits in lieu of any upfront money. That turned out to be a mistake. Also in the cast is Aneta Corsaut who later had a long career in television with co-starring roles on the "Andy Griffith Show" and "Matlock." McQueen, one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars of the 1960s and 1970s, died at the age of 50 in 1980. He was a one-of-a-kind actor and personality who marched to his own beat,to say the least. Late in his career, McQueen was asked about having any regrets and answered "I should have taken the offer for 10% of "The Blob."
