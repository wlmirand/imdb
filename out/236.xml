 <sinopse>
  An irresponsible, drug-addicted, recently impregnated woman finds herself in the middle of an abortion debate when both parties attempt to sway her to their respective sides.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Ruth Stoops is a poor indigent drug-user (a huffer - inhaling glue and paint for a high) whose down and out existence is complicated once more by becoming pregnant (she has had and lost four children already). When a judge orders that she gets an abortion or face a felony charge, she is befriended by Gail Stoney, a pro-lifer whose husband is president of the local "Babysavers" group. Suddenly Ruth is thrust into the middle of the pro-choice/pro-life struggle, with each side wanting her to take their side as a "message" to others - and the situation escalates...

    Alexander Payne's debut feature film, and it's right on the money. Big kudos to the extraordinary performance of the wonderful Laura Dern, which really lifts 'Citizen Ruth' to a higher plan; how she puts both humor and drama into the role of an often deliriously haphazard, but also very headstrong junkie is pure craftsmanship. There are plenty of other actors that make great contributions as well, such as Kurtwood Smith and M.C. Gainey, while other roles are mostly pretty decent to simply adequate. The other main character (beside Dern) in this film is actually really the simple, but no less brilliant baring of a thorny issue, wherein two parties - pro and con - are ruthlessly portrayed. It's a bold choice to choose such an approach, but with the clever way of building up the plot and keeping drama and humor tightly tugging at both ends of it, Payne makes a truly clean getaway. Kudos (again, see my recent review for 'Election')! And finally, it's worth mentioning that the Nebraska settings, the clothing, and the overall (mostly bleak) look of the film really put in an extra ingredient to make this so much more true to life than your average movie. And watch out for those weird little shots, like the one where Laura Dern is checking out her leg in the bathtub, each time with the other eye closed. Cinematographic details of pure beauty!

    Before writer/director Alexander Payne was making deep, intimate pictures centered around eccentric humans playing a little game called "Life," he was concocting explosive satires, bursting at the seams with originality and charm. His directorial debut, Citizen Ruth, is a little stroll through the eclectic-side of his days. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern) is a rather despicable woman. She has had multiple kids and has been addicted to inhaling substances from glue to patio sealant for years now. When she discovers she is pregnant again, she tosses around the idea of having an abortion, so as not to give birth to another unfortunate, helpless soul. Having no family and no one to turn to for advice, she finds herself intrusively manipulated by pro-life and pro-choice groups from all walks of life, and his taken in by a well-meaning couple, played by Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place. They will provide her with everything she could need, including protection from the media, so long as she doesn't give into the abortion. The remainder of the film centers around the asinine attention the media pays to Ruth and her "family," and how she may be forcefully committed to one side because of their obnoxious manipulation. What is truly amazing, however, is how Citizen Ruth manages to perfectly keep a centrist viewpoint, showing both sides at their utmost ridiculous. Never does the film show a direct bias. From watching this, we can sort of believe that Payne's view on the entire abortion issue is simplified to something along the lines of, "both sides are equally right and equally bizarre." Dern here is spectacularly, embodying a character void of any likability traits and sophistication as a whole. She is an unkempt, sorry mess of a woman and Payne portrays her exactly as that. While it may not be the most complete film out there, or even one of the funniest satires (especially when you put to along side Election, Payne's sophomore effort), it still is a reasonable compliment to say that Citizen Ruth does a splendid job of keeping a film about a controversial issue neutral and viable throughout its runtime. Starring: Laura Dern, Kurtwood Smith, and Mary Kay Place. Directed by: Alexander Payne.

    This was supposed to be a comedy, but I really did not find it funny. It wasn't really black comedy as we were not laughing at death, and Ruth's situation was so appalling and stuffed up that we felt put off by her as opposed to seeing it funny. The movie opens with Ruth having sex with a guy and she isn't even enjoying it, so she is booted out. She is not allowed to see her kids, and everybody seems to hate her, and she is hooked on inhaling paint fumes. She lands up in gaol, and is charged with the crime of endangering a fetus, but can get off by having an abortion. This is where the comedy is supposed to come out for two groups, the pro and anti-abortionists. They make the anti-abortionists right wing fundamental Christians, and the pro-abortionists are bizarre, moon worshiping lesbians with huge Vietnam vets protecting them. Both are trying to force Ruth to follow their lead, but in the end she manages to escape. The one good thing about the movie, is they leave her walking away. She has not changed, nor has she redeemed herself - she simply has a choice now. She can choose whether to have the baby or not. Personally, she is probably going to abort it because she still has the charge hanging over her head. As I said, this is a disturbing movie in the way they try to make it a comedy about a person you really don't want to laugh about. She is alone, selfish, and addicted to drugs, and in the end, you really don't want to get to know any more about her.

    I know the best Idea for a new Trailer would be to feature the Actors like Red from That 70's Show and Adeline From Big Love and you know the rest. The comedy is hidden in the fact that this movie was before the kind of comedy that is out today. I just watched it again the other day cause I remember this movie from long time ago and I felt like it should of been made last year. It has some flaws but it old what do you expect! I like this movie, and had to share it with my friends and family. I also like that it's a crazy story and pushes boundaries. would like to see more opinions about this movie cause some people don't like that kind of thing.

    Pitiful, bedraggled Ruth is a forlorn specimen of hopelessness with more than a dozen arrests for illegal inhalation. She has just been kicked out by her one-night boyfriend and turned away by her fed-up brother-in-law. The arresting cops already know her name. Now she's told she is pregnant. "You've been found to be an unfit mother four times!" a flabbergasted judge tells her. "Uh-uh," Ruth says. "Two times." The judge charges her with "felony criminal endangerment of a fetus," though submits in candor to drop the charges if she'll have an abortion. The displaced good intentions there are nothing compared to the ideological thicket that Ruth wanders into after her case becomes a national battleground for pro- and anti-abortion groups. Citizen Ruth, the feature debut of definitive contemporary film wit Alexander Payne, a filmmaker of rare intelligence who's on the short list of American directors with final cut rights for their films, is a satire with the reckless courage to take on both sides in the abortion debate. There are no positive characters in the film, certainly not Ruth, whose preferred state is oblivion, and who perks up only when both sides start making cash offers. Whereas almost every film has a market in mind, here is a movie with a little something to offend anyone who has a strong opinion on abortion. Who's left to market this movie to? Perhaps those diminishing figures who have a high regard for movies with audacity and sharpness, and do not demand to be gratified and bolstered by the characters on the screen. Some may find it too delineative to compensate more than a single viewing, but nevertheless a stimulating one-time wonder. Others see more ironic fine points upon multiple viewings. This makes it all the more valuable because what satire must do in order to work is take effective shots at both sides of whatever issue it holds to censure. The movie is an arcade of finely honed satiric sketches. Thrown into jail, Ruth finds herself sharing the same cell with hymn-singing "Baby Savers" who have been jailed after a protest at an abortion clinic. She is promptly taken under the wings of Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place, who bring her home to an innocent milieu, innocent, i.e., until she finds their son's airplane glue. Gail oscillates between worship of life and acid disputes with her teenage daughter, who sooner or later helps Ruth slip away to a party. One of the Baby Savers is Swoozie Kurtz, who uncovers herself as a mole for the pro-choice side, and whisks Ruth off to the wilderness retreat she shares with her lesbian lover, Rachel, who sings to the moon. They organize for Ruth to have an abortion, however already the Baby Savers have issued a national alert, the network crews are camped out in the parking lot, and the national leaders for both sides have flown into Tulsa to make their stands. Shot in Nebraska just like Payne's exceedingly brilliant subsequent films Election and About Schmidt, Payne has a good eye for the character qualities of fanatics with the compulsion to control other people's lives. The leader of the pro-choice side, played by Tippi Hedren, is rendered as so hip and shrewd that you know it's a disguise for indescribable skeletons in the closet. And the leader of the pro-lifers is played by Burt Reynolds as a sloganeering fraud who glorifies the "American family values" crap while retaining a boy toy on his payroll. There is nerve in the determination to make Ruth an unredeemed dope-head whose sole impulse is to go for the cash. Though unjustifiably careless and ignorant as Ruth is, she becomes extremely funny via Payne's fitting of her into such incongruous surroundings as much as Laura Dern's hysterical performance. Attesting herself as a superb physical comedian, the in-shape and gangly Dern lashes and yells her way through the catastrophe that explodes over her quandary. And yet with momentous satirical elegance, this definitive sleeper watches how both sides exploit this oblivious nonentity's soul, or lack thereof, in a variety of endeavors to forcibly convey their stance to the American public. I have misgivings that the two sides in the debate would in reality undertake a bidding war, but that's what satire is for: To take reality and broaden it into farce. The movie sheds light on the ways in which mainstream films condition us to count on formula endings. Most movies are made with the credence that no one in the audience can be counted on to think about more than one concept at a time, at the very most. I'm happily bowled over when it arises that there will be no "good side" and "bad side" in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e over Ruth, and astonished when it seems that the movie will not turn up securely with a resolution to satisfy everyone. Some states of affairs, Payne appear to be contending, just cannot be reconciled to everyone's liking. Perhaps, for some viewers, that will make this not a comedy at all.

    I have to applaud this movie for being so neutral on the issue and showing us the hypocrisy and the cheap tricks and the inner contradictions present on both sides of the issue. Being what I call "a sane pro-lifer in pursuit of a consistent body of bioethics", at first I was somewhat upset by the fact that the movie only portrayed the two prevailing opposite camps regarding the issue of abortion, with presumably atheist lesbians (who, of course, turn out to be goddess adoring pseudo-pagans) with their snobby and self-righteous rhetoric about freedom to choose all the while they try to control Ruth's body on the one hand, and the apparently prudish, sexually repressed, and oh, of course, hypocritical born-again Christians on the other. But then I figured, even though Ruth was the not so intelligent, politically incorrect, irresponsible, glue-huffing character who didn't seem to have any self-declared ethical concern for the issue, it was really through her naive outbursts that the movie seemed to point to a need for a more honest and human approach. What I loved the most, however, was the end scene where Ruth escaped the abortion clinic with all the money in the bag and no one even noticed. It really summed up the whole point of the movie for me - that no one really saw her - not just then, not ever at all. Everyone was so caught up in their own hysteria that it had never been about Ruth at all. You won't get bored with this movie. It's funny, it's honest, and the pace is consistent throughout.

    I have seen Laura Dern in a few movies, but none that really showed her ability as this one. The was an outrageously funny abortion satire and she really shined as the huffer that gets pregnant and is the pawn of both sides in the fight over a fetus. Both sides - pro-choice and anti-abortion - were made fun of in this film. They were people that you would really not want to know. Mary Kay Place is a "Baby Saver" that hasn't got a clue. Her daughter is sneaking out at night, and her "righteous" husband is just a letch. She takes in Ruth (Dern) and gets her to those so-called counseling centers so they can work her over. Swoosie Kurtz rescues her, but Ruth soon finds that the other side is just as bad. The druggie and unfit mother soon scams them all in a very satisfactory ending. Dern plays a perfect white-trash Barbie that is out for herself. She really gives a great performance as she switches from booze to bathroom-cleaning fluid, and back to booze. Ruth is just out for Ruth and she manages to take care of herself. She sees money as a solution to all her problems, and Dern plays up her ignorance in a manner that is well worth watching. Burt Reynolds and Tippi Hedren play the national leaders on both sides of the abortion war. It really doesn't matter which side you are one, but you will definitely be pro-Laura Dern after seeing this.

    This is a hard movie to interpret. Not the story, but the intended message, because surely there is one. The story is straightforward enough. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern)is a drug-abusing, loud-mouthed, selfish girl who has had a couple of illegitimate kids and is now pregnant again. She's been in and out of jail and rehab programs so often she can't remember how many times. Now she's picked up for sniffing glue again and the court puts her back in the slams and advises her, strongly, to abort this new child. But she is bailed out by a devout working-class family (Kurtwood Smith, Mary Kay Place) who want to save her and her baby. They're sincere enough. They have a tough time scraping together the $400 bail. The home they take her to is a stifling nest of conventional religiosity and hypocrisy. They don't smoke, don't drink, don't swear, say grace before each meal, and their teen-age daughter sneaks out at night to get drunk and party. And hubby can't stop himself from eying Dern's nubile figure when she's careless with her garb. ("You know, I used to be quite a sinner," he tells her while they lie side by side in his old bed.) The family introduce her to a "counseling agency" who do their best to talk her into saving her baby. The medical staff congratulate her on her pregnancy and show her a doll about the size of the fetus she's now carrying. ("It's even got a little thing on it," she says. "Sure, because it's a boy doll!") They show her a movie of dead, aborted children, which compares abortion to Buchenwald and Auschwitz, and she winds up changing her mind. "Gee, I slept on dumpsters. Maybe I slept on some babies." But she's spirited away by a pro-abortion spy (Swoozie Kurtz) who has been undercover in The Baby Savers movement, and she's taken home to be brainwashed by Kurtz and her girlfriend, who apparently worship Selene, the moon, because they keen a kind of folk song at the night sky. They massage the acupuncture points in her bare feet while they propagandize her and Dern loves it. "Do my spleen again." So she decides to abort. But then The Baby Savers come up with a $15,000 check if she decides to save the baby. So she decides to have the baby. And then a Vietnam vet among the pro-choicers matches the reward, so she decides to abort. By this time the issue has become nation-wide and has drawn in the leader of the Baby Savers, Burt Reynolds, who ups the ante to $27,000 if Dern will save the baby. So she decides to save the baby. (During all this, she's been swilling and sniffing everything in sight.) I won't give away the ending except to say that Ruth steals some money and makes off with it before anyone notices. Final shot: Dern marching off alone into the distance, accompanied by a triumphant theme, strong-willed, street savvy, a bag full of cash slung over her determined shoulder, still lacking in the frontal lobes that might allow her to plan for a future. It's a satirical look at the abortion debate, and more black than comedic, although it has its laugh lines. Nobody comes off at all well, except maybe the Vietnam amputee who sees through Ruth and offers his $15,000 anyway. That is, she's been planning on how she might spend the windfall. She'll make a down payment on a new house, then buy a new car, then maybe travel to Europe. The vet listens to this then tells her it's baloney, that both of them know the $15,000 will last her about three days. The cast is littered with familiar names, none of whom do an outstanding job but all of whom are competent enough. As a stimulus-hungry, self-destructive, mentally challenged teen-ager, Laura Dern is an attractive and sexy young woman but not a teen-ager. Burt Reynolds brings his usual role distance to the job. He proudly introduces the first boy he ever saved by adopting, the boy who's now about fifteen, the boy who fetches the ice for Reynolds' drinks, the boy who now massages Reynolds' tanned and muscular shoulders on command. But where is the movie headed? I was all in favor of the pro-abortionist lesbians but I don't think that's what was intended. Most black comedies at least give you someone to root for, even if he's not victorious. "Dr. Strangelove" was a black comedy, too, but President Merkin Muffley at least was sane and rational. Here, the Vietnam vet's role is far too minor for us to identify with him in any way. This reminds me more of Tom Wolf's "Bonfire of the Vanities." Everybody in it is stupid and/or rotten. And the intentions of the producers is ambiguous, along the lines of one of Randy Newman's songs -- "I Love L.A." or "Short People". Is Newman really defiantly saying he loves Los Angeles, or is he kidding? Maybe the message is that of the Buddha, who was a very practical man. All things in moderation. Avoid zealotry. An excess of passion always leads to disappointment and pain in one form or another.

    This movie seemed so realistic, it was almost like being involved in it. After watching it over 20 times I still see small real things, like when the Judge asked to see Ruth in his office, he pushed to door shut, and immediately, for his own protection, opened it a crack before telling her "If you want to see a doctor while in jail...you can go". He didn't want that to get out but it did. I can sympathize with the Judge, he wanted to save the state a million dollars over the next 18 years. Mr. Payne really had it together and didn't miss a beat. He was slick too, for at the end he made Ruth the "bad guy" and was able to keep the pro-choice and baby savers evenly balanced, not giving way to either. Norm worked in a hardware store, and like Harlan, was very realistic. Every person seemed so real...and I think some of the cops WERE real. I first saw this movie on TV by accident, nothing else on. The second time I taped it. This movie made me go and rent or buy every Laura Dern movie I could find. This is my favorite movie.

    Citizen Ruth is a poignant, thought-provoking and at times harrowing drama which is well-written and enjoyable to watch. Which is why I was confused when it was marketed on the VHS and DVD releases as a comedy, with comments branding it "hilarious". There were humorous moments within the film thanks to the witty scriptwriting, but this serves as added depth to the characters of a film which is otherwise much more important than a simple story, but instead highlights the socio-economic problems facing us in the modern world, and for the most part does so with grim reality. Rent this out on DVD expecting laughs or a straightforward story and you're likely to be disappointed - instead watch the film for what it is - a superbly acted drama provoking discussions on important issues.

    Pitiful, bedraggled Ruth is a forlorn specimen of hopelessness with more than a dozen arrests for illegal inhalation. She has just been kicked out by her one-night boyfriend and turned away by her fed-up brother-in-law. The arresting cops already know her name. Now she's told she is pregnant. "You've been found to be an unfit mother four times!" a flabbergasted judge tells her. "Uh-uh," Ruth says. "Two times." The judge charges her with "felony criminal endangerment of a fetus," though submits in candor to drop the charges if she'll have an abortion. The displaced good intentions there are nothing compared to the ideological thicket that Ruth wanders into after her case becomes a national battleground for pro- and anti-abortion groups. Citizen Ruth, the feature debut of definitive contemporary film wit Alexander Payne, a filmmaker of rare intelligence who's on the short list of American directors with final cut rights for their films, is a satire with the reckless courage to take on both sides in the abortion debate. There are no positive characters in the film, certainly not Ruth, whose preferred state is oblivion, and who perks up only when both sides start making cash offers. Whereas almost every film has a market in mind, here is a movie with a little something to offend anyone who has a strong opinion on abortion. Who's left to market this movie to? Perhaps those diminishing figures who have a high regard for movies with audacity and sharpness, and do not demand to be gratified and bolstered by the characters on the screen. Some may find it too delineative to compensate more than a single viewing, but nevertheless a stimulating one-time wonder. Others see more ironic fine points upon multiple viewings. This makes it all the more valuable because what satire must do in order to work is take effective shots at both sides of whatever issue it holds to censure. The movie is an arcade of finely honed satiric sketches. Thrown into jail, Ruth finds herself sharing the same cell with hymn-singing "Baby Savers" who have been jailed after a protest at an abortion clinic. She is promptly taken under the wings of Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place, who bring her home to an innocent milieu, innocent, i.e., until she finds their son's airplane glue. Gail oscillates between worship of life and acid disputes with her teenage daughter, who sooner or later helps Ruth slip away to a party. One of the Baby Savers is Swoozie Kurtz, who uncovers herself as a mole for the pro-choice side, and whisks Ruth off to the wilderness retreat she shares with her lesbian lover, Rachel, who sings to the moon. They organize for Ruth to have an abortion, however already the Baby Savers have issued a national alert, the network crews are camped out in the parking lot, and the national leaders for both sides have flown into Tulsa to make their stands. Shot in Nebraska just like Payne's exceedingly brilliant subsequent films Election and About Schmidt, Payne has a good eye for the character qualities of fanatics with the compulsion to control other people's lives. The leader of the pro-choice side, played by Tippi Hedren, is rendered as so hip and shrewd that you know it's a disguise for indescribable skeletons in the closet. And the leader of the pro-lifers is played by Burt Reynolds as a sloganeering fraud who glorifies the "American family values" crap while retaining a boy toy on his payroll. There is nerve in the determination to make Ruth an unredeemed dope-head whose sole impulse is to go for the cash. Though unjustifiably careless and ignorant as Ruth is, she becomes extremely funny via Payne's fitting of her into such incongruous surroundings as much as Laura Dern's hysterical performance. Attesting herself as a superb physical comedian, the in-shape and gangly Dern lashes and yells her way through the catastrophe that explodes over her quandary. And yet with momentous satirical elegance, this definitive sleeper watches how both sides exploit this oblivious nonentity's soul, or lack thereof, in a variety of endeavors to forcibly convey their stance to the American public. I have misgivings that the two sides in the debate would in reality undertake a bidding war, but that's what satire is for: To take reality and broaden it into farce. The movie sheds light on the ways in which mainstream films condition us to count on formula endings. Most movies are made with the credence that no one in the audience can be counted on to think about more than one concept at a time, at the very most. I'm happily bowled over when it arises that there will be no "good side" and "bad side" in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e over Ruth, and astonished when it seems that the movie will not turn up securely with a resolution to satisfy everyone. Some states of affairs, Payne appear to be contending, just cannot be reconciled to everyone's liking. Perhaps, for some viewers, that will make this not a comedy at all.

    I have to applaud this movie for being so neutral on the issue and showing us the hypocrisy and the cheap tricks and the inner contradictions present on both sides of the issue. Being what I call "a sane pro-lifer in pursuit of a consistent body of bioethics", at first I was somewhat upset by the fact that the movie only portrayed the two prevailing opposite camps regarding the issue of abortion, with presumably atheist lesbians (who, of course, turn out to be goddess adoring pseudo-pagans) with their snobby and self-righteous rhetoric about freedom to choose all the while they try to control Ruth's body on the one hand, and the apparently prudish, sexually repressed, and oh, of course, hypocritical born-again Christians on the other. But then I figured, even though Ruth was the not so intelligent, politically incorrect, irresponsible, glue-huffing character who didn't seem to have any self-declared ethical concern for the issue, it was really through her naive outbursts that the movie seemed to point to a need for a more honest and human approach. What I loved the most, however, was the end scene where Ruth escaped the abortion clinic with all the money in the bag and no one even noticed. It really summed up the whole point of the movie for me - that no one really saw her - not just then, not ever at all. Everyone was so caught up in their own hysteria that it had never been about Ruth at all. You won't get bored with this movie. It's funny, it's honest, and the pace is consistent throughout.

    I have seen Laura Dern in a few movies, but none that really showed her ability as this one. The was an outrageously funny abortion satire and she really shined as the huffer that gets pregnant and is the pawn of both sides in the fight over a fetus. Both sides - pro-choice and anti-abortion - were made fun of in this film. They were people that you would really not want to know. Mary Kay Place is a "Baby Saver" that hasn't got a clue. Her daughter is sneaking out at night, and her "righteous" husband is just a letch. She takes in Ruth (Dern) and gets her to those so-called counseling centers so they can work her over. Swoosie Kurtz rescues her, but Ruth soon finds that the other side is just as bad. The druggie and unfit mother soon scams them all in a very satisfactory ending. Dern plays a perfect white-trash Barbie that is out for herself. She really gives a great performance as she switches from booze to bathroom-cleaning fluid, and back to booze. Ruth is just out for Ruth and she manages to take care of herself. She sees money as a solution to all her problems, and Dern plays up her ignorance in a manner that is well worth watching. Burt Reynolds and Tippi Hedren play the national leaders on both sides of the abortion war. It really doesn't matter which side you are one, but you will definitely be pro-Laura Dern after seeing this.

    This is a hard movie to interpret. Not the story, but the intended message, because surely there is one. The story is straightforward enough. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern)is a drug-abusing, loud-mouthed, selfish girl who has had a couple of illegitimate kids and is now pregnant again. She's been in and out of jail and rehab programs so often she can't remember how many times. Now she's picked up for sniffing glue again and the court puts her back in the slams and advises her, strongly, to abort this new child. But she is bailed out by a devout working-class family (Kurtwood Smith, Mary Kay Place) who want to save her and her baby. They're sincere enough. They have a tough time scraping together the $400 bail. The home they take her to is a stifling nest of conventional religiosity and hypocrisy. They don't smoke, don't drink, don't swear, say grace before each meal, and their teen-age daughter sneaks out at night to get drunk and party. And hubby can't stop himself from eying Dern's nubile figure when she's careless with her garb. ("You know, I used to be quite a sinner," he tells her while they lie side by side in his old bed.) The family introduce her to a "counseling agency" who do their best to talk her into saving her baby. The medical staff congratulate her on her pregnancy and show her a doll about the size of the fetus she's now carrying. ("It's even got a little thing on it," she says. "Sure, because it's a boy doll!") They show her a movie of dead, aborted children, which compares abortion to Buchenwald and Auschwitz, and she winds up changing her mind. "Gee, I slept on dumpsters. Maybe I slept on some babies." But she's spirited away by a pro-abortion spy (Swoozie Kurtz) who has been undercover in The Baby Savers movement, and she's taken home to be brainwashed by Kurtz and her girlfriend, who apparently worship Selene, the moon, because they keen a kind of folk song at the night sky. They massage the acupuncture points in her bare feet while they propagandize her and Dern loves it. "Do my spleen again." So she decides to abort. But then The Baby Savers come up with a $15,000 check if she decides to save the baby. So she decides to have the baby. And then a Vietnam vet among the pro-choicers matches the reward, so she decides to abort. By this time the issue has become nation-wide and has drawn in the leader of the Baby Savers, Burt Reynolds, who ups the ante to $27,000 if Dern will save the baby. So she decides to save the baby. (During all this, she's been swilling and sniffing everything in sight.) I won't give away the ending except to say that Ruth steals some money and makes off with it before anyone notices. Final shot: Dern marching off alone into the distance, accompanied by a triumphant theme, strong-willed, street savvy, a bag full of cash slung over her determined shoulder, still lacking in the frontal lobes that might allow her to plan for a future. It's a satirical look at the abortion debate, and more black than comedic, although it has its laugh lines. Nobody comes off at all well, except maybe the Vietnam amputee who sees through Ruth and offers his $15,000 anyway. That is, she's been planning on how she might spend the windfall. She'll make a down payment on a new house, then buy a new car, then maybe travel to Europe. The vet listens to this then tells her it's baloney, that both of them know the $15,000 will last her about three days. The cast is littered with familiar names, none of whom do an outstanding job but all of whom are competent enough. As a stimulus-hungry, self-destructive, mentally challenged teen-ager, Laura Dern is an attractive and sexy young woman but not a teen-ager. Burt Reynolds brings his usual role distance to the job. He proudly introduces the first boy he ever saved by adopting, the boy who's now about fifteen, the boy who fetches the ice for Reynolds' drinks, the boy who now massages Reynolds' tanned and muscular shoulders on command. But where is the movie headed? I was all in favor of the pro-abortionist lesbians but I don't think that's what was intended. Most black comedies at least give you someone to root for, even if he's not victorious. "Dr. Strangelove" was a black comedy, too, but President Merkin Muffley at least was sane and rational. Here, the Vietnam vet's role is far too minor for us to identify with him in any way. This reminds me more of Tom Wolf's "Bonfire of the Vanities." Everybody in it is stupid and/or rotten. And the intentions of the producers is ambiguous, along the lines of one of Randy Newman's songs -- "I Love L.A." or "Short People". Is Newman really defiantly saying he loves Los Angeles, or is he kidding? Maybe the message is that of the Buddha, who was a very practical man. All things in moderation. Avoid zealotry. An excess of passion always leads to disappointment and pain in one form or another.

    This movie seemed so realistic, it was almost like being involved in it. After watching it over 20 times I still see small real things, like when the Judge asked to see Ruth in his office, he pushed to door shut, and immediately, for his own protection, opened it a crack before telling her "If you want to see a doctor while in jail...you can go". He didn't want that to get out but it did. I can sympathize with the Judge, he wanted to save the state a million dollars over the next 18 years. Mr. Payne really had it together and didn't miss a beat. He was slick too, for at the end he made Ruth the "bad guy" and was able to keep the pro-choice and baby savers evenly balanced, not giving way to either. Norm worked in a hardware store, and like Harlan, was very realistic. Every person seemed so real...and I think some of the cops WERE real. I first saw this movie on TV by accident, nothing else on. The second time I taped it. This movie made me go and rent or buy every Laura Dern movie I could find. This is my favorite movie.

    Citizen Ruth is a poignant, thought-provoking and at times harrowing drama which is well-written and enjoyable to watch. Which is why I was confused when it was marketed on the VHS and DVD releases as a comedy, with comments branding it "hilarious". There were humorous moments within the film thanks to the witty scriptwriting, but this serves as added depth to the characters of a film which is otherwise much more important than a simple story, but instead highlights the socio-economic problems facing us in the modern world, and for the most part does so with grim reality. Rent this out on DVD expecting laughs or a straightforward story and you're likely to be disappointed - instead watch the film for what it is - a superbly acted drama provoking discussions on important issues.

    Alexander Payne's debut feature film, and it's right on the money. Big kudos to the extraordinary performance of the wonderful Laura Dern, which really lifts 'Citizen Ruth' to a higher plan; how she puts both humor and drama into the role of an often deliriously haphazard, but also very headstrong junkie is pure craftsmanship. There are plenty of other actors that make great contributions as well, such as Kurtwood Smith and M.C. Gainey, while other roles are mostly pretty decent to simply adequate. The other main character (beside Dern) in this film is actually really the simple, but no less brilliant baring of a thorny issue, wherein two parties - pro and con - are ruthlessly portrayed. It's a bold choice to choose such an approach, but with the clever way of building up the plot and keeping drama and humor tightly tugging at both ends of it, Payne makes a truly clean getaway. Kudos (again, see my recent review for 'Election')! And finally, it's worth mentioning that the Nebraska settings, the clothing, and the overall (mostly bleak) look of the film really put in an extra ingredient to make this so much more true to life than your average movie. And watch out for those weird little shots, like the one where Laura Dern is checking out her leg in the bathtub, each time with the other eye closed. Cinematographic details of pure beauty!

    Before writer/director Alexander Payne was making deep, intimate pictures centered around eccentric humans playing a little game called "Life," he was concocting explosive satires, bursting at the seams with originality and charm. His directorial debut, Citizen Ruth, is a little stroll through the eclectic-side of his days. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern) is a rather despicable woman. She has had multiple kids and has been addicted to inhaling substances from glue to patio sealant for years now. When she discovers she is pregnant again, she tosses around the idea of having an abortion, so as not to give birth to another unfortunate, helpless soul. Having no family and no one to turn to for advice, she finds herself intrusively manipulated by pro-life and pro-choice groups from all walks of life, and his taken in by a well-meaning couple, played by Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place. They will provide her with everything she could need, including protection from the media, so long as she doesn't give into the abortion. The remainder of the film centers around the asinine attention the media pays to Ruth and her "family," and how she may be forcefully committed to one side because of their obnoxious manipulation. What is truly amazing, however, is how Citizen Ruth manages to perfectly keep a centrist viewpoint, showing both sides at their utmost ridiculous. Never does the film show a direct bias. From watching this, we can sort of believe that Payne's view on the entire abortion issue is simplified to something along the lines of, "both sides are equally right and equally bizarre." Dern here is spectacularly, embodying a character void of any likability traits and sophistication as a whole. She is an unkempt, sorry mess of a woman and Payne portrays her exactly as that. While it may not be the most complete film out there, or even one of the funniest satires (especially when you put to along side Election, Payne's sophomore effort), it still is a reasonable compliment to say that Citizen Ruth does a splendid job of keeping a film about a controversial issue neutral and viable throughout its runtime. Starring: Laura Dern, Kurtwood Smith, and Mary Kay Place. Directed by: Alexander Payne.

    This was supposed to be a comedy, but I really did not find it funny. It wasn't really black comedy as we were not laughing at death, and Ruth's situation was so appalling and stuffed up that we felt put off by her as opposed to seeing it funny. The movie opens with Ruth having sex with a guy and she isn't even enjoying it, so she is booted out. She is not allowed to see her kids, and everybody seems to hate her, and she is hooked on inhaling paint fumes. She lands up in gaol, and is charged with the crime of endangering a fetus, but can get off by having an abortion. This is where the comedy is supposed to come out for two groups, the pro and anti-abortionists. They make the anti-abortionists right wing fundamental Christians, and the pro-abortionists are bizarre, moon worshiping lesbians with huge Vietnam vets protecting them. Both are trying to force Ruth to follow their lead, but in the end she manages to escape. The one good thing about the movie, is they leave her walking away. She has not changed, nor has she redeemed herself - she simply has a choice now. She can choose whether to have the baby or not. Personally, she is probably going to abort it because she still has the charge hanging over her head. As I said, this is a disturbing movie in the way they try to make it a comedy about a person you really don't want to laugh about. She is alone, selfish, and addicted to drugs, and in the end, you really don't want to get to know any more about her.

    I know the best Idea for a new Trailer would be to feature the Actors like Red from That 70's Show and Adeline From Big Love and you know the rest. The comedy is hidden in the fact that this movie was before the kind of comedy that is out today. I just watched it again the other day cause I remember this movie from long time ago and I felt like it should of been made last year. It has some flaws but it old what do you expect! I like this movie, and had to share it with my friends and family. I also like that it's a crazy story and pushes boundaries. would like to see more opinions about this movie cause some people don't like that kind of thing.

They have a tough time scraping together the $400 bail. The home they take her to is a stifling nest of conventional religiosity and hypocrisy. They don't smoke, don't drink, don't swear, say grace before each meal, and their teen-age daughter sneaks out at night to get drunk and party. And hubby can't stop himself from eying Dern's nubile figure when she's careless with her garb. ("You know, I used to be quite a sinner," he tells her while they lie side by side in his old bed.) The family introduce her to a "counseling agency" who do their best to talk her into saving her baby. The medical staff congratulate her on her pregnancy and show her a doll about the size of the fetus she's now carrying. ("It's even got a little thing on it," she says. "Sure, because it's a boy doll!") They show her a movie of dead, aborted children, which compares abortion to Buchenwald and Auschwitz, and she winds up changing her mind. "Gee, I slept on dumpsters. Maybe I slept on some babies." But she's spirited away by a pro-abortion spy (Swoozie Kurtz) who has been undercover in The Baby Savers movement, and she's taken home to be brainwashed by Kurtz and her girlfriend, who apparently worship Selene, the moon, because they keen a kind of folk song at the night sky. They massage the acupuncture points in her bare feet while they propagandize her and Dern loves it. "Do my spleen again." So she decides to abort. But then The Baby Savers come up with a $15,000 check if she decides to save the baby. So she decides to have the baby. And then a Vietnam vet among the pro-choicers matches the reward, so she decides to abort. By this time the issue has become nation-wide and has drawn in the leader of the Baby Savers, Burt Reynolds, who ups the ante to $27,000 if Dern will save the baby. So she decides to save the baby. (During all this, she's been swilling and sniffing everything in sight.) I won't give away the ending except to say that Ruth steals some money and makes off with it before anyone notices. Final shot: Dern marching off alone into the distance, accompanied by a triumphant theme, strong-willed, street savvy, a bag full of cash slung over her determined shoulder, still lacking in the frontal lobes that might allow her to plan for a future. It's a satirical look at the abortion debate, and more black than comedic, although it has its laugh lines. Nobody comes off at all well, except maybe the Vietnam amputee who sees through Ruth and offers his $15,000 anyway. That is, she's been planning on how she might spend the windfall. She'll make a down payment on a new house, then buy a new car, then maybe travel to Europe. The vet listens to this then tells her it's baloney, that both of them know the $15,000 will last her about three days. The cast is littered with familiar names, none of whom do an outstanding job but all of whom are competent enough. As a stimulus-hungry, self-destructive, mentally challenged teen-ager, Laura Dern is an attractive and sexy young woman but not a teen-ager. Burt Reynolds brings his usual role distance to the job. He proudly introduces the first boy he ever saved by adopting, the boy who's now about fifteen, the boy who fetches the ice for Reynolds' drinks, the boy who now massages Reynolds' tanned and muscular shoulders on command. But where is the movie headed? I was all in favor of the pro-abortionist lesbians but I don't think that's what was intended. Most black comedies at least give you someone to root for, even if he's not victorious. "Dr. Strangelove" was a black comedy, too, but President Merkin Muffley at least was sane and rational. Here, the Vietnam vet's role is far too minor for us to identify with him in any way. This reminds me more of Tom Wolf's "Bonfire of the Vanities." Everybody in it is stupid and/or rotten. And the intentions of the producers is ambiguous, along the lines of one of Randy Newman's songs -- "I Love L.A." or "Short People". Is Newman really defiantly saying he loves Los Angeles, or is he kidding? Maybe the message is that of the Buddha, who was a very practical man. All things in moderation. Avoid zealotry. An excess of passion always leads to disappointment and pain in one form or another.

    This movie seemed so realistic, it was almost like being involved in it. After watching it over 20 times I still see small real things, like when the Judge asked to see Ruth in his office, he pushed to door shut, and immediately, for his own protection, opened it a crack before telling her "If you want to see a doctor while in jail...you can go". He didn't want that to get out but it did. I can sympathize with the Judge, he wanted to save the state a million dollars over the next 18 years. Mr. Payne really had it together and didn't miss a beat. He was slick too, for at the end he made Ruth the "bad guy" and was able to keep the pro-choice and baby savers evenly balanced, not giving way to either. Norm worked in a hardware store, and like Harlan, was very realistic. Every person seemed so real...and I think some of the cops WERE real. I first saw this movie on TV by accident, nothing else on. The second time I taped it. This movie made me go and rent or buy every Laura Dern movie I could find. This is my favorite movie.

    Citizen Ruth is a poignant, thought-provoking and at times harrowing drama which is well-written and enjoyable to watch. Which is why I was confused when it was marketed on the VHS and DVD releases as a comedy, with comments branding it "hilarious". There were humorous moments within the film thanks to the witty scriptwriting, but this serves as added depth to the characters of a film which is otherwise much more important than a simple story, but instead highlights the socio-economic problems facing us in the modern world, and for the most part does so with grim reality. Rent this out on DVD expecting laughs or a straightforward story and you're likely to be disappointed - instead watch the film for what it is - a superbly acted drama provoking discussions on important issues.

    Alexander Payne's debut feature film, and it's right on the money. Big kudos to the extraordinary performance of the wonderful Laura Dern, which really lifts 'Citizen Ruth' to a higher plan; how she puts both humor and drama into the role of an often deliriously haphazard, but also very headstrong junkie is pure craftsmanship. There are plenty of other actors that make great contributions as well, such as Kurtwood Smith and M.C. Gainey, while other roles are mostly pretty decent to simply adequate. The other main character (beside Dern) in this film is actually really the simple, but no less brilliant baring of a thorny issue, wherein two parties - pro and con - are ruthlessly portrayed. It's a bold choice to choose such an approach, but with the clever way of building up the plot and keeping drama and humor tightly tugging at both ends of it, Payne makes a truly clean getaway. Kudos (again, see my recent review for 'Election')! And finally, it's worth mentioning that the Nebraska settings, the clothing, and the overall (mostly bleak) look of the film really put in an extra ingredient to make this so much more true to life than your average movie. And watch out for those weird little shots, like the one where Laura Dern is checking out her leg in the bathtub, each time with the other eye closed. Cinematographic details of pure beauty!

    Before writer/director Alexander Payne was making deep, intimate pictures centered around eccentric humans playing a little game called "Life," he was concocting explosive satires, bursting at the seams with originality and charm. His directorial debut, Citizen Ruth, is a little stroll through the eclectic-side of his days. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern) is a rather despicable woman. She has had multiple kids and has been addicted to inhaling substances from glue to patio sealant for years now. When she discovers she is pregnant again, she tosses around the idea of having an abortion, so as not to give birth to another unfortunate, helpless soul. Having no family and no one to turn to for advice, she finds herself intrusively manipulated by pro-life and pro-choice groups from all walks of life, and his taken in by a well-meaning couple, played by Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place. They will provide her with everything she could need, including protection from the media, so long as she doesn't give into the abortion. The remainder of the film centers around the asinine attention the media pays to Ruth and her "family," and how she may be forcefully committed to one side because of their obnoxious manipulation. What is truly amazing, however, is how Citizen Ruth manages to perfectly keep a centrist viewpoint, showing both sides at their utmost ridiculous. Never does the film show a direct bias. From watching this, we can sort of believe that Payne's view on the entire abortion issue is simplified to something along the lines of, "both sides are equally right and equally bizarre." Dern here is spectacularly, embodying a character void of any likability traits and sophistication as a whole. She is an unkempt, sorry mess of a woman and Payne portrays her exactly as that. While it may not be the most complete film out there, or even one of the funniest satires (especially when you put to along side Election, Payne's sophomore effort), it still is a reasonable compliment to say that Citizen Ruth does a splendid job of keeping a film about a controversial issue neutral and viable throughout its runtime. Starring: Laura Dern, Kurtwood Smith, and Mary Kay Place. Directed by: Alexander Payne.

    This was supposed to be a comedy, but I really did not find it funny. It wasn't really black comedy as we were not laughing at death, and Ruth's situation was so appalling and stuffed up that we felt put off by her as opposed to seeing it funny. The movie opens with Ruth having sex with a guy and she isn't even enjoying it, so she is booted out. She is not allowed to see her kids, and everybody seems to hate her, and she is hooked on inhaling paint fumes. She lands up in gaol, and is charged with the crime of endangering a fetus, but can get off by having an abortion. This is where the comedy is supposed to come out for two groups, the pro and anti-abortionists. They make the anti-abortionists right wing fundamental Christians, and the pro-abortionists are bizarre, moon worshiping lesbians with huge Vietnam vets protecting them. Both are trying to force Ruth to follow their lead, but in the end she manages to escape. The one good thing about the movie, is they leave her walking away. She has not changed, nor has she redeemed herself - she simply has a choice now. She can choose whether to have the baby or not. Personally, she is probably going to abort it because she still has the charge hanging over her head. As I said, this is a disturbing movie in the way they try to make it a comedy about a person you really don't want to laugh about. She is alone, selfish, and addicted to drugs, and in the end, you really don't want to get to know any more about her.

    I know the best Idea for a new Trailer would be to feature the Actors like Red from That 70's Show and Adeline From Big Love and you know the rest. The comedy is hidden in the fact that this movie was before the kind of comedy that is out today. I just watched it again the other day cause I remember this movie from long time ago and I felt like it should of been made last year. It has some flaws but it old what do you expect! I like this movie, and had to share it with my friends and family. I also like that it's a crazy story and pushes boundaries. would like to see more opinions about this movie cause some people don't like that kind of thing.

    Pitiful, bedraggled Ruth is a forlorn specimen of hopelessness with more than a dozen arrests for illegal inhalation. She has just been kicked out by her one-night boyfriend and turned away by her fed-up brother-in-law. The arresting cops already know her name. Now she's told she is pregnant. "You've been found to be an unfit mother four times!" a flabbergasted judge tells her. "Uh-uh," Ruth says. "Two times." The judge charges her with "felony criminal endangerment of a fetus," though submits in candor to drop the charges if she'll have an abortion. The displaced good intentions there are nothing compared to the ideological thicket that Ruth wanders into after her case becomes a national battleground for pro- and anti-abortion groups. Citizen Ruth, the feature debut of definitive contemporary film wit Alexander Payne, a filmmaker of rare intelligence who's on the short list of American directors with final cut rights for their films, is a satire with the reckless courage to take on both sides in the abortion debate. There are no positive characters in the film, certainly not Ruth, whose preferred state is oblivion, and who perks up only when both sides start making cash offers. Whereas almost every film has a market in mind, here is a movie with a little something to offend anyone who has a strong opinion on abortion. Who's left to market this movie to? Perhaps those diminishing figures who have a high regard for movies with audacity and sharpness, and do not demand to be gratified and bolstered by the characters on the screen. Some may find it too delineative to compensate more than a single viewing, but nevertheless a stimulating one-time wonder. Others see more ironic fine points upon multiple viewings. This makes it all the more valuable because what satire must do in order to work is take effective shots at both sides of whatever issue it holds to censure. The movie is an arcade of finely honed satiric sketches. Thrown into jail, Ruth finds herself sharing the same cell with hymn-singing "Baby Savers" who have been jailed after a protest at an abortion clinic. She is promptly taken under the wings of Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place, who bring her home to an innocent milieu, innocent, i.e., until she finds their son's airplane glue. Gail oscillates between worship of life and acid disputes with her teenage daughter, who sooner or later helps Ruth slip away to a party. One of the Baby Savers is Swoozie Kurtz, who uncovers herself as a mole for the pro-choice side, and whisks Ruth off to the wilderness retreat she shares with her lesbian lover, Rachel, who sings to the moon. They organize for Ruth to have an abortion, however already the Baby Savers have issued a national alert, the network crews are camped out in the parking lot, and the national leaders for both sides have flown into Tulsa to make their stands. Shot in Nebraska just like Payne's exceedingly brilliant subsequent films Election and About Schmidt, Payne has a good eye for the character qualities of fanatics with the compulsion to control other people's lives. The leader of the pro-choice side, played by Tippi Hedren, is rendered as so hip and shrewd that you know it's a disguise for indescribable skeletons in the closet. And the leader of the pro-lifers is played by Burt Reynolds as a sloganeering fraud who glorifies the "American family values" crap while retaining a boy toy on his payroll. There is nerve in the determination to make Ruth an unredeemed dope-head whose sole impulse is to go for the cash. Though unjustifiably careless and ignorant as Ruth is, she becomes extremely funny via Payne's fitting of her into such incongruous surroundings as much as Laura Dern's hysterical performance. Attesting herself as a superb physical comedian, the in-shape and gangly Dern lashes and yells her way through the catastrophe that explodes over her quandary. And yet with momentous satirical elegance, this definitive sleeper watches how both sides exploit this oblivious nonentity's soul, or lack thereof, in a variety of endeavors to forcibly convey their stance to the American public. I have misgivings that the two sides in the debate would in reality undertake a bidding war, but that's what satire is for: To take reality and broaden it into farce. The movie sheds light on the ways in which mainstream films condition us to count on formula endings. Most movies are made with the credence that no one in the audience can be counted on to think about more than one concept at a time, at the very most. I'm happily bowled over when it arises that there will be no "good side" and "bad side" in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e over Ruth, and astonished when it seems that the movie will not turn up securely with a resolution to satisfy everyone. Some states of affairs, Payne appear to be contending, just cannot be reconciled to everyone's liking. Perhaps, for some viewers, that will make this not a comedy at all.

    I have to applaud this movie for being so neutral on the issue and showing us the hypocrisy and the cheap tricks and the inner contradictions present on both sides of the issue. Being what I call "a sane pro-lifer in pursuit of a consistent body of bioethics", at first I was somewhat upset by the fact that the movie only portrayed the two prevailing opposite camps regarding the issue of abortion, with presumably atheist lesbians (who, of course, turn out to be goddess adoring pseudo-pagans) with their snobby and self-righteous rhetoric about freedom to choose all the while they try to control Ruth's body on the one hand, and the apparently prudish, sexually repressed, and oh, of course, hypocritical born-again Christians on the other. But then I figured, even though Ruth was the not so intelligent, politically incorrect, irresponsible, glue-huffing character who didn't seem to have any self-declared ethical concern for the issue, it was really through her naive outbursts that the movie seemed to point to a need for a more honest and human approach. What I loved the most, however, was the end scene where Ruth escaped the abortion clinic with all the money in the bag and no one even noticed. It really summed up the whole point of the movie for me - that no one really saw her - not just then, not ever at all. Everyone was so caught up in their own hysteria that it had never been about Ruth at all. You won't get bored with this movie. It's funny, it's honest, and the pace is consistent throughout.

    I have seen Laura Dern in a few movies, but none that really showed her ability as this one. The was an outrageously funny abortion satire and she really shined as the huffer that gets pregnant and is the pawn of both sides in the fight over a fetus. Both sides - pro-choice and anti-abortion - were made fun of in this film. They were people that you would really not want to know. Mary Kay Place is a "Baby Saver" that hasn't got a clue. Her daughter is sneaking out at night, and her "righteous" husband is just a letch. She takes in Ruth (Dern) and gets her to those so-called counseling centers so they can work her over. Swoosie Kurtz rescues her, but Ruth soon finds that the other side is just as bad. The druggie and unfit mother soon scams them all in a very satisfactory ending. Dern plays a perfect white-trash Barbie that is out for herself. She really gives a great performance as she switches from booze to bathroom-cleaning fluid, and back to booze. Ruth is just out for Ruth and she manages to take care of herself. She sees money as a solution to all her problems, and Dern plays up her ignorance in a manner that is well worth watching. Burt Reynolds and Tippi Hedren play the national leaders on both sides of the abortion war. It really doesn't matter which side you are one, but you will definitely be pro-Laura Dern after seeing this.

    This is a hard movie to interpret. Not the story, but the intended message, because surely there is one. The story is straightforward enough. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern)is a drug-abusing, loud-mouthed, selfish girl who has had a couple of illegitimate kids and is now pregnant again. She's been in and out of jail and rehab programs so often she can't remember how many times. Now she's picked up for sniffing glue again and the court puts her back in the slams and advises her, strongly, to abort this new child. But she is bailed out by a devout working-class family (Kurtwood Smith, Mary Kay Place) who want to save her and her baby. They're sincere enough. They have a tough time scraping together the $400 bail. The home they take her to is a stifling nest of conventional religiosity and hypocrisy. They don't smoke, don't drink, don't swear, say grace before each meal, and their teen-age daughter sneaks out at night to get drunk and party. And hubby can't stop himself from eying Dern's nubile figure when she's careless with her garb. ("You know, I used to be quite a sinner," he tells her while they lie side by side in his old bed.) The family introduce her to a "counseling agency" who do their best to talk her into saving her baby. The medical staff congratulate her on her pregnancy and show her a doll about the size of the fetus she's now carrying. ("It's even got a little thing on it," she says. "Sure, because it's a boy doll!") They show her a movie of dead, aborted children, which compares abortion to Buchenwald and Auschwitz, and she winds up changing her mind. "Gee, I slept on dumpsters. Maybe I slept on some babies." But she's spirited away by a pro-abortion spy (Swoozie Kurtz) who has been undercover in The Baby Savers movement, and she's taken home to be brainwashed by Kurtz and her girlfriend, who apparently worship Selene, the moon, because they keen a kind of folk song at the night sky. They massage the acupuncture points in her bare feet while they propagandize her and Dern loves it. "Do my spleen again." So she decides to abort. But then The Baby Savers come up with a $15,000 check if she decides to save the baby. So she decides to have the baby. And then a Vietnam vet among the pro-choicers matches the reward, so she decides to abort. By this time the issue has become nation-wide and has drawn in the leader of the Baby Savers, Burt Reynolds, who ups the ante to $27,000 if Dern will save the baby. So she decides to save the baby. (During all this, she's been swilling and sniffing everything in sight.) I won't give away the ending except to say that Ruth steals some money and makes off with it before anyone notices. Final shot: Dern marching off alone into the distance, accompanied by a triumphant theme, strong-willed, street savvy, a bag full of cash slung over her determined shoulder, still lacking in the frontal lobes that might allow her to plan for a future. It's a satirical look at the abortion debate, and more black than comedic, although it has its laugh lines. Nobody comes off at all well, except maybe the Vietnam amputee who sees through Ruth and offers his $15,000 anyway. That is, she's been planning on how she might spend the windfall. She'll make a down payment on a new house, then buy a new car, then maybe travel to Europe. The vet listens to this then tells her it's baloney, that both of them know the $15,000 will last her about three days. The cast is littered with familiar names, none of whom do an outstanding job but all of whom are competent enough. As a stimulus-hungry, self-destructive, mentally challenged teen-ager, Laura Dern is an attractive and sexy young woman but not a teen-ager. Burt Reynolds brings his usual role distance to the job. He proudly introduces the first boy he ever saved by adopting, the boy who's now about fifteen, the boy who fetches the ice for Reynolds' drinks, the boy who now massages Reynolds' tanned and muscular shoulders on command. But where is the movie headed? I was all in favor of the pro-abortionist lesbians but I don't think that's what was intended.

His directorial debut, Citizen Ruth, is a little stroll through the eclectic-side of his days. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern) is a rather despicable woman. She has had multiple kids and has been addicted to inhaling substances from glue to patio sealant for years now. When she discovers she is pregnant again, she tosses around the idea of having an abortion, so as not to give birth to another unfortunate, helpless soul. Having no family and no one to turn to for advice, she finds herself intrusively manipulated by pro-life and pro-choice groups from all walks of life, and his taken in by a well-meaning couple, played by Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place. They will provide her with everything she could need, including protection from the media, so long as she doesn't give into the abortion. The remainder of the film centers around the asinine attention the media pays to Ruth and her "family," and how she may be forcefully committed to one side because of their obnoxious manipulation. What is truly amazing, however, is how Citizen Ruth manages to perfectly keep a centrist viewpoint, showing both sides at their utmost ridiculous. Never does the film show a direct bias. From watching this, we can sort of believe that Payne's view on the entire abortion issue is simplified to something along the lines of, "both sides are equally right and equally bizarre." Dern here is spectacularly, embodying a character void of any likability traits and sophistication as a whole. She is an unkempt, sorry mess of a woman and Payne portrays her exactly as that. While it may not be the most complete film out there, or even one of the funniest satires (especially when you put to along side Election, Payne's sophomore effort), it still is a reasonable compliment to say that Citizen Ruth does a splendid job of keeping a film about a controversial issue neutral and viable throughout its runtime. Starring: Laura Dern, Kurtwood Smith, and Mary Kay Place. Directed by: Alexander Payne.

    This was supposed to be a comedy, but I really did not find it funny. It wasn't really black comedy as we were not laughing at death, and Ruth's situation was so appalling and stuffed up that we felt put off by her as opposed to seeing it funny. The movie opens with Ruth having sex with a guy and she isn't even enjoying it, so she is booted out. She is not allowed to see her kids, and everybody seems to hate her, and she is hooked on inhaling paint fumes. She lands up in gaol, and is charged with the crime of endangering a fetus, but can get off by having an abortion. This is where the comedy is supposed to come out for two groups, the pro and anti-abortionists. They make the anti-abortionists right wing fundamental Christians, and the pro-abortionists are bizarre, moon worshiping lesbians with huge Vietnam vets protecting them. Both are trying to force Ruth to follow their lead, but in the end she manages to escape. The one good thing about the movie, is they leave her walking away. She has not changed, nor has she redeemed herself - she simply has a choice now. She can choose whether to have the baby or not. Personally, she is probably going to abort it because she still has the charge hanging over her head. As I said, this is a disturbing movie in the way they try to make it a comedy about a person you really don't want to laugh about. She is alone, selfish, and addicted to drugs, and in the end, you really don't want to get to know any more about her.

    I know the best Idea for a new Trailer would be to feature the Actors like Red from That 70's Show and Adeline From Big Love and you know the rest. The comedy is hidden in the fact that this movie was before the kind of comedy that is out today. I just watched it again the other day cause I remember this movie from long time ago and I felt like it should of been made last year. It has some flaws but it old what do you expect! I like this movie, and had to share it with my friends and family. I also like that it's a crazy story and pushes boundaries. would like to see more opinions about this movie cause some people don't like that kind of thing.

    Pitiful, bedraggled Ruth is a forlorn specimen of hopelessness with more than a dozen arrests for illegal inhalation. She has just been kicked out by her one-night boyfriend and turned away by her fed-up brother-in-law. The arresting cops already know her name. Now she's told she is pregnant. "You've been found to be an unfit mother four times!" a flabbergasted judge tells her. "Uh-uh," Ruth says. "Two times." The judge charges her with "felony criminal endangerment of a fetus," though submits in candor to drop the charges if she'll have an abortion. The displaced good intentions there are nothing compared to the ideological thicket that Ruth wanders into after her case becomes a national battleground for pro- and anti-abortion groups. Citizen Ruth, the feature debut of definitive contemporary film wit Alexander Payne, a filmmaker of rare intelligence who's on the short list of American directors with final cut rights for their films, is a satire with the reckless courage to take on both sides in the abortion debate. There are no positive characters in the film, certainly not Ruth, whose preferred state is oblivion, and who perks up only when both sides start making cash offers. Whereas almost every film has a market in mind, here is a movie with a little something to offend anyone who has a strong opinion on abortion. Who's left to market this movie to? Perhaps those diminishing figures who have a high regard for movies with audacity and sharpness, and do not demand to be gratified and bolstered by the characters on the screen. Some may find it too delineative to compensate more than a single viewing, but nevertheless a stimulating one-time wonder. Others see more ironic fine points upon multiple viewings. This makes it all the more valuable because what satire must do in order to work is take effective shots at both sides of whatever issue it holds to censure. The movie is an arcade of finely honed satiric sketches. Thrown into jail, Ruth finds herself sharing the same cell with hymn-singing "Baby Savers" who have been jailed after a protest at an abortion clinic. She is promptly taken under the wings of Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place, who bring her home to an innocent milieu, innocent, i.e., until she finds their son's airplane glue. Gail oscillates between worship of life and acid disputes with her teenage daughter, who sooner or later helps Ruth slip away to a party. One of the Baby Savers is Swoozie Kurtz, who uncovers herself as a mole for the pro-choice side, and whisks Ruth off to the wilderness retreat she shares with her lesbian lover, Rachel, who sings to the moon. They organize for Ruth to have an abortion, however already the Baby Savers have issued a national alert, the network crews are camped out in the parking lot, and the national leaders for both sides have flown into Tulsa to make their stands. Shot in Nebraska just like Payne's exceedingly brilliant subsequent films Election and About Schmidt, Payne has a good eye for the character qualities of fanatics with the compulsion to control other people's lives. The leader of the pro-choice side, played by Tippi Hedren, is rendered as so hip and shrewd that you know it's a disguise for indescribable skeletons in the closet. And the leader of the pro-lifers is played by Burt Reynolds as a sloganeering fraud who glorifies the "American family values" crap while retaining a boy toy on his payroll. There is nerve in the determination to make Ruth an unredeemed dope-head whose sole impulse is to go for the cash. Though unjustifiably careless and ignorant as Ruth is, she becomes extremely funny via Payne's fitting of her into such incongruous surroundings as much as Laura Dern's hysterical performance. Attesting herself as a superb physical comedian, the in-shape and gangly Dern lashes and yells her way through the catastrophe that explodes over her quandary. And yet with momentous satirical elegance, this definitive sleeper watches how both sides exploit this oblivious nonentity's soul, or lack thereof, in a variety of endeavors to forcibly convey their stance to the American public. I have misgivings that the two sides in the debate would in reality undertake a bidding war, but that's what satire is for: To take reality and broaden it into farce. The movie sheds light on the ways in which mainstream films condition us to count on formula endings. Most movies are made with the credence that no one in the audience can be counted on to think about more than one concept at a time, at the very most. I'm happily bowled over when it arises that there will be no "good side" and "bad side" in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e over Ruth, and astonished when it seems that the movie will not turn up securely with a resolution to satisfy everyone. Some states of affairs, Payne appear to be contending, just cannot be reconciled to everyone's liking. Perhaps, for some viewers, that will make this not a comedy at all.

    I have to applaud this movie for being so neutral on the issue and showing us the hypocrisy and the cheap tricks and the inner contradictions present on both sides of the issue. Being what I call "a sane pro-lifer in pursuit of a consistent body of bioethics", at first I was somewhat upset by the fact that the movie only portrayed the two prevailing opposite camps regarding the issue of abortion, with presumably atheist lesbians (who, of course, turn out to be goddess adoring pseudo-pagans) with their snobby and self-righteous rhetoric about freedom to choose all the while they try to control Ruth's body on the one hand, and the apparently prudish, sexually repressed, and oh, of course, hypocritical born-again Christians on the other. But then I figured, even though Ruth was the not so intelligent, politically incorrect, irresponsible, glue-huffing character who didn't seem to have any self-declared ethical concern for the issue, it was really through her naive outbursts that the movie seemed to point to a need for a more honest and human approach. What I loved the most, however, was the end scene where Ruth escaped the abortion clinic with all the money in the bag and no one even noticed. It really summed up the whole point of the movie for me - that no one really saw her - not just then, not ever at all. Everyone was so caught up in their own hysteria that it had never been about Ruth at all. You won't get bored with this movie. It's funny, it's honest, and the pace is consistent throughout.

    I have seen Laura Dern in a few movies, but none that really showed her ability as this one. The was an outrageously funny abortion satire and she really shined as the huffer that gets pregnant and is the pawn of both sides in the fight over a fetus. Both sides - pro-choice and anti-abortion - were made fun of in this film. They were people that you would really not want to know. Mary Kay Place is a "Baby Saver" that hasn't got a clue. Her daughter is sneaking out at night, and her "righteous" husband is just a letch. She takes in Ruth (Dern) and gets her to those so-called counseling centers so they can work her over. Swoosie Kurtz rescues her, but Ruth soon finds that the other side is just as bad. The druggie and unfit mother soon scams them all in a very satisfactory ending. Dern plays a perfect white-trash Barbie that is out for herself. She really gives a great performance as she switches from booze to bathroom-cleaning fluid, and back to booze. Ruth is just out for Ruth and she manages to take care of herself. She sees money as a solution to all her problems, and Dern plays up her ignorance in a manner that is well worth watching. Burt Reynolds and Tippi Hedren play the national leaders on both sides of the abortion war. It really doesn't matter which side you are one, but you will definitely be pro-Laura Dern after seeing this.

    This is a hard movie to interpret. Not the story, but the intended message, because surely there is one. The story is straightforward enough. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern)is a drug-abusing, loud-mouthed, selfish girl who has had a couple of illegitimate kids and is now pregnant again. She's been in and out of jail and rehab programs so often she can't remember how many times. Now she's picked up for sniffing glue again and the court puts her back in the slams and advises her, strongly, to abort this new child. But she is bailed out by a devout working-class family (Kurtwood Smith, Mary Kay Place) who want to save her and her baby. They're sincere enough. They have a tough time scraping together the $400 bail. The home they take her to is a stifling nest of conventional religiosity and hypocrisy. They don't smoke, don't drink, don't swear, say grace before each meal, and their teen-age daughter sneaks out at night to get drunk and party. And hubby can't stop himself from eying Dern's nubile figure when she's careless with her garb. ("You know, I used to be quite a sinner," he tells her while they lie side by side in his old bed.) The family introduce her to a "counseling agency" who do their best to talk her into saving her baby. The medical staff congratulate her on her pregnancy and show her a doll about the size of the fetus she's now carrying. ("It's even got a little thing on it," she says. "Sure, because it's a boy doll!") They show her a movie of dead, aborted children, which compares abortion to Buchenwald and Auschwitz, and she winds up changing her mind. "Gee, I slept on dumpsters. Maybe I slept on some babies." But she's spirited away by a pro-abortion spy (Swoozie Kurtz) who has been undercover in The Baby Savers movement, and she's taken home to be brainwashed by Kurtz and her girlfriend, who apparently worship Selene, the moon, because they keen a kind of folk song at the night sky. They massage the acupuncture points in her bare feet while they propagandize her and Dern loves it. "Do my spleen again." So she decides to abort. But then The Baby Savers come up with a $15,000 check if she decides to save the baby. So she decides to have the baby. And then a Vietnam vet among the pro-choicers matches the reward, so she decides to abort. By this time the issue has become nation-wide and has drawn in the leader of the Baby Savers, Burt Reynolds, who ups the ante to $27,000 if Dern will save the baby. So she decides to save the baby. (During all this, she's been swilling and sniffing everything in sight.) I won't give away the ending except to say that Ruth steals some money and makes off with it before anyone notices. Final shot: Dern marching off alone into the distance, accompanied by a triumphant theme, strong-willed, street savvy, a bag full of cash slung over her determined shoulder, still lacking in the frontal lobes that might allow her to plan for a future. It's a satirical look at the abortion debate, and more black than comedic, although it has its laugh lines. Nobody comes off at all well, except maybe the Vietnam amputee who sees through Ruth and offers his $15,000 anyway. That is, she's been planning on how she might spend the windfall. She'll make a down payment on a new house, then buy a new car, then maybe travel to Europe. The vet listens to this then tells her it's baloney, that both of them know the $15,000 will last her about three days. The cast is littered with familiar names, none of whom do an outstanding job but all of whom are competent enough. As a stimulus-hungry, self-destructive, mentally challenged teen-ager, Laura Dern is an attractive and sexy young woman but not a teen-ager. Burt Reynolds brings his usual role distance to the job. He proudly introduces the first boy he ever saved by adopting, the boy who's now about fifteen, the boy who fetches the ice for Reynolds' drinks, the boy who now massages Reynolds' tanned and muscular shoulders on command. But where is the movie headed? I was all in favor of the pro-abortionist lesbians but I don't think that's what was intended. Most black comedies at least give you someone to root for, even if he's not victorious. "Dr. Strangelove" was a black comedy, too, but President Merkin Muffley at least was sane and rational. Here, the Vietnam vet's role is far too minor for us to identify with him in any way. This reminds me more of Tom Wolf's "Bonfire of the Vanities." Everybody in it is stupid and/or rotten. And the intentions of the producers is ambiguous, along the lines of one of Randy Newman's songs -- "I Love L.A." or "Short People". Is Newman really defiantly saying he loves Los Angeles, or is he kidding? Maybe the message is that of the Buddha, who was a very practical man. All things in moderation. Avoid zealotry. An excess of passion always leads to disappointment and pain in one form or another.

    This movie seemed so realistic, it was almost like being involved in it. After watching it over 20 times I still see small real things, like when the Judge asked to see Ruth in his office, he pushed to door shut, and immediately, for his own protection, opened it a crack before telling her "If you want to see a doctor while in jail...you can go". He didn't want that to get out but it did. I can sympathize with the Judge, he wanted to save the state a million dollars over the next 18 years. Mr. Payne really had it together and didn't miss a beat. He was slick too, for at the end he made Ruth the "bad guy" and was able to keep the pro-choice and baby savers evenly balanced, not giving way to either. Norm worked in a hardware store, and like Harlan, was very realistic. Every person seemed so real...and I think some of the cops WERE real. I first saw this movie on TV by accident, nothing else on. The second time I taped it. This movie made me go and rent or buy every Laura Dern movie I could find. This is my favorite movie.

    Citizen Ruth is a poignant, thought-provoking and at times harrowing drama which is well-written and enjoyable to watch. Which is why I was confused when it was marketed on the VHS and DVD releases as a comedy, with comments branding it "hilarious". There were humorous moments within the film thanks to the witty scriptwriting, but this serves as added depth to the characters of a film which is otherwise much more important than a simple story, but instead highlights the socio-economic problems facing us in the modern world, and for the most part does so with grim reality. Rent this out on DVD expecting laughs or a straightforward story and you're likely to be disappointed - instead watch the film for what it is - a superbly acted drama provoking discussions on important issues.
