 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Chile, second half of the 20th century. The poor Esteban marries Clara and they get a daughter, Blanca. Esteban works hard and eventually gets money to buy a hacienda, eventually to become a local patriarch. He becomes very conservative and is feared by his workers. When Blanca grows up, she falls in love with a young revolutionary, Pedro, who urges the workers to fight for socialism. It is unavoidable that Pedro and Esteban are pitted against each other. Esteban tries to stop the love affair between Pedro and his daughter by all means possible but soon Blanca becomes pregnant and has a daughter. The void between father and daughter seems unbridgeable when Blanca moves in with Pedro.

    For whatever The House Of The Spirits draws in criticism, it has one overriding virtue. Among the many things that Americans are deficient in knowledge about is South America. This film and the book by Isabel Allende give us an insight into Chile and their society. Not something that in news, literature, or cinema that we deal with all the time. Unlike many South American countries Chile had a long democratic tradition until the coup that toppled President Allende in 1973. As a society it was not a series of military dictatorships as other countries. It was also a prosperous country. But one where prosperity was reserved for a few. This film is the story of the rags to riches rise of Ernesto Trueba as played by Jeremy Irons. He does it like so many in America do, he marries it and in this case it's Meryl Streep, a woman who has psychic powers which she has contained since childhood lest she be regarded as a freak. Irons marries her and they have a daughter that grows up to be Winona Ryder. Irons is our central character and like many who rise from poverty even in this country they want to make sure that even the hint of it never touches their person or their families. He's one nasty Padrone and makes sure everyone knows he's not one of them any more. And like a medieval lord he takes his pleasures wherever while always maintaining a respectable married front. One of those 'pleasures' gives him a nasty surprise in the end. And of course he doesn't want daughter Ryder mixing with any of the peasant kids. When she has an affair with Antonio Banderas who has been radicalized it's not something that Irons can abide. The period of Chilean history takes us from the 30s right through the right wing coup against Allende and its aftermath with Pinochet military dictatorship. Irons becomes a Chilean Senator of their Conservative party. But while his party approves of the coup Irons survives to learn that old maxim about being careful what you wish for. He finds being a Senator carries very little wait among the members of the Pinochet junta. Meryl Streep turns in a fine performance as his wife and her talents for clairvoyance and levitation seem kind of superfluous to the main story. This film clearly belongs to Jeremy Irons. The House Of The Spirits is a well constructed film with some moving performances and is recommended highly for those who want some insights into Chilean history and culture.

    This film was a bomb, losing millions of dollars. And I'm not surprised. It's a very serious film which would be likely to attract a very specific and small audience. Thank goodness films like this occasionally get made. I know it sounds as if I just contradicted myself, but just because it was a bomb, didn't mean that it's not a fine film. And the strength of this film are the performances. The strongest of the performances is by Glenn Close, who plays the lead male's sister who has lesbian inclinations. She's been treated unfairly her whole life and suffers for most of it. A strong, strong performance. Next is Meryl Streep. Just about as good as always as the psychic wife of the male lead. Then we come to Jeremy Irons. Hmmmmm. I have mixed feelings here. Irons' character here is so despicable that you know he will get his comeuppance before the movie ends. Is it wise to be that obvious? To play it that "hard"? I think not. So I'll reserve judgment here simply because, typically, Irons is a wonderful actor. In supporting roles, the most notable are those of Winona Ryder as the daughter and Antonio Banderas as her poor lover. Both do great jobs. I enjoyed seeing Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl as the parents of Streep, but they didn't get enough screen time. Now as to the script. It's good...perhaps a tad slow in a few places. But character development is rather thorough. The story is of a relatively poor young man who falls in love, but works to strike gold in order to marry a relatively rich girl. He does, but she dies. So, eventually he marries her sister (Streep), who doesn't talk...by her own choice. She does talk with him, however, and for a while they have a happy life. But he is a bitter shell of a man who has become a patrone who treats pretty much everyone harshly, always insisting he is boss. You know, as I mentioned earlier, that he will get his comeuppance, but it's cleverly done here in a way that combines personal tragedy with the history of so many South American countries. Although it's never made clear in the film, the country depicted is Chile. A special note should be made of the makeup used to age the main characters. It's done very well here...a much better job than in a lot of films. I recommend this film IF you like serious movies. Otherwise, it may bore you. I found it rather compelling.

    The House Of The Spirits would be be for the 18 crowd. I found this movie to be a tedious and rather pointless movie. To me, I saw little purpose in this movie. There are many actors and actresses which I love to see are in this movie. Stars such as Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave and Antonio Banderas are in this flick. The House Of Spirits is a long movie. I believe that 20 minutes could have been edited out. Yes, The House of the Spirits movie does give one insight as to how people in Chile live. I was disappointed to have so many of my favorite stars in a pointless film. This is definitely a movie to have on TV and play cards to or have another activity going on. If you don't have anything else to do but relax, watch it. I give The House Of the Spirits three thumbs up.

    2013 - and I have never even heard of this movie !!!! What a surprise ! The Book must have been fantastic because the movie is such a journey through the lives of this Chilean family. Jeromy Irons is extremely good, Wynona Ryder plays her part well, Meryl Streep as always is excellent and to think she was only 50 at the time, she plays an excellent Matriarc, Antonia Banderas's part is limited perhaps Melanie Griffiths didn't want him too close to Wynona ???????? I thought the had great on screen appeal as a couple. all in all it is a movie I will recommend to others - simply can't believe I had not heard of it before now. If this is a true interpretation of the era in Chile, I am so glad I live in Australia.

    I have always been a fan of Jeremy Irons and I am yet to find anybody who is not one of Meryl Streep.. They particularly excel if the roles are of serious tone and have a touch of melancholy.. the characters they play in this movie, are exactly that.. The stand out performance in the movie is that of Glenn Close , who has made the character come alive.. Winona Ryder looking stunning and could have been given more screen-time along with Antonio Banderas, both being versatile actors.. The story moves though three generation in just above two hours and you feel it..

    First this movie is a biased interpretation of the history of Chile (based on a book by Isadora Allende---yes related to the communist president who was assassinated). The Allende government like all far left governments quickly shut down the productive economy impoverishing everyone in the process (it had nothing to do with a plot by United Fruit or the evil market economies as suggested in the movie). The movie---I am finally getting there--is lavishly filmed and entertaining I got some amusement by seeing the bad guys win. The novel has some more entertaining subplots like the one involving the "aristocratic" Frenchman who marries the daughter in the book. Look all in all it is entertaining has wonderful actors and if you love Chile you will enjoy it--just ignore the pounding political correctness.

    I had the pleasure of catching this movie on Netflix after almost 13+ years. I was only 14 the last time my cousin, sister and I had sat together one warm summer afternoon and watched this on HBO. After that I didn't remember the name of the movie, just knew enough to know that Meryl Streep was in it. The movie made a mark on my childhood, I was deeply engrossed by the mystical capabilities on Streep. Her poignance and courage in the movie paved the way for much of the artsy feeling I enjoyed. Years later I still love the movie, frankly because it brought back memories of my childhood and I got a chance to relive it all.

    To capture the rich complexity and the intensity of a novel by Isabel Allende is not an easy task; however, it is one that Bille August attempts to do with the film version of Allende's "The House of Spirits." Jam-packed with a stunning cast, including Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and Winona Ryder, the film covers a span of around 70 years, giving us a glimpse of the different aspects of the family's life that shapes who they become as the film progresses. Although the acting is well done and the storyline enticing, I sometimes felt lost between the large jumps in time, as well as the various side stories that were only surfaced upon, such as that with the other son. I feel that in order to truly capture the complexity of Allende's novel, the film would have to be long enough to delve into each character and their respective stories with much more detail.

    Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words:"The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint, the tainted sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers, cognitive and mediumistic, this hardened woman, loyal to his blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., the bastard child of Senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. The film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.

    For whatever The House Of The Spirits draws in criticism, it has one overriding virtue. Among the many things that Americans are deficient in knowledge about is South America. This film and the book by Isabel Allende give us an insight into Chile and their society. Not something that in news, literature, or cinema that we deal with all the time. Unlike many South American countries Chile had a long democratic tradition until the coup that toppled President Allende in 1973. As a society it was not a series of military dictatorships as other countries. It was also a prosperous country. But one where prosperity was reserved for a few. This film is the story of the rags to riches rise of Ernesto Trueba as played by Jeremy Irons. He does it like so many in America do, he marries it and in this case it's Meryl Streep, a woman who has psychic powers which she has contained since childhood lest she be regarded as a freak. Irons marries her and they have a daughter that grows up to be Winona Ryder. Irons is our central character and like many who rise from poverty even in this country they want to make sure that even the hint of it never touches their person or their families. He's one nasty Padrone and makes sure everyone knows he's not one of them any more. And like a medieval lord he takes his pleasures wherever while always maintaining a respectable married front. One of those 'pleasures' gives him a nasty surprise in the end. And of course he doesn't want daughter Ryder mixing with any of the peasant kids. When she has an affair with Antonio Banderas who has been radicalized it's not something that Irons can abide. The period of Chilean history takes us from the 30s right through the right wing coup against Allende and its aftermath with Pinochet military dictatorship. Irons becomes a Chilean Senator of their Conservative party. But while his party approves of the coup Irons survives to learn that old maxim about being careful what you wish for. He finds being a Senator carries very little wait among the members of the Pinochet junta. Meryl Streep turns in a fine performance as his wife and her talents for clairvoyance and levitation seem kind of superfluous to the main story. This film clearly belongs to Jeremy Irons. The House Of The Spirits is a well constructed film with some moving performances and is recommended highly for those who want some insights into Chilean history and culture.

    This film was a bomb, losing millions of dollars. And I'm not surprised. It's a very serious film which would be likely to attract a very specific and small audience. Thank goodness films like this occasionally get made. I know it sounds as if I just contradicted myself, but just because it was a bomb, didn't mean that it's not a fine film. And the strength of this film are the performances. The strongest of the performances is by Glenn Close, who plays the lead male's sister who has lesbian inclinations. She's been treated unfairly her whole life and suffers for most of it. A strong, strong performance. Next is Meryl Streep. Just about as good as always as the psychic wife of the male lead. Then we come to Jeremy Irons. Hmmmmm. I have mixed feelings here. Irons' character here is so despicable that you know he will get his comeuppance before the movie ends. Is it wise to be that obvious? To play it that "hard"? I think not. So I'll reserve judgment here simply because, typically, Irons is a wonderful actor. In supporting roles, the most notable are those of Winona Ryder as the daughter and Antonio Banderas as her poor lover. Both do great jobs. I enjoyed seeing Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl as the parents of Streep, but they didn't get enough screen time. Now as to the script. It's good...perhaps a tad slow in a few places. But character development is rather thorough. The story is of a relatively poor young man who falls in love, but works to strike gold in order to marry a relatively rich girl. He does, but she dies. So, eventually he marries her sister (Streep), who doesn't talk...by her own choice. She does talk with him, however, and for a while they have a happy life. But he is a bitter shell of a man who has become a patrone who treats pretty much everyone harshly, always insisting he is boss. You know, as I mentioned earlier, that he will get his comeuppance, but it's cleverly done here in a way that combines personal tragedy with the history of so many South American countries. Although it's never made clear in the film, the country depicted is Chile. A special note should be made of the makeup used to age the main characters. It's done very well here...a much better job than in a lot of films. I recommend this film IF you like serious movies. Otherwise, it may bore you. I found it rather compelling.

    The House Of The Spirits would be be for the 18 crowd. I found this movie to be a tedious and rather pointless movie. To me, I saw little purpose in this movie. There are many actors and actresses which I love to see are in this movie. Stars such as Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave and Antonio Banderas are in this flick. The House Of Spirits is a long movie. I believe that 20 minutes could have been edited out. Yes, The House of the Spirits movie does give one insight as to how people in Chile live. I was disappointed to have so many of my favorite stars in a pointless film. This is definitely a movie to have on TV and play cards to or have another activity going on. If you don't have anything else to do but relax, watch it. I give The House Of the Spirits three thumbs up.

    2013 - and I have never even heard of this movie !!!! What a surprise ! The Book must have been fantastic because the movie is such a journey through the lives of this Chilean family. Jeromy Irons is extremely good, Wynona Ryder plays her part well, Meryl Streep as always is excellent and to think she was only 50 at the time, she plays an excellent Matriarc, Antonia Banderas's part is limited perhaps Melanie Griffiths didn't want him too close to Wynona ???????? I thought the had great on screen appeal as a couple. all in all it is a movie I will recommend to others - simply can't believe I had not heard of it before now. If this is a true interpretation of the era in Chile, I am so glad I live in Australia.

    I have always been a fan of Jeremy Irons and I am yet to find anybody who is not one of Meryl Streep.. They particularly excel if the roles are of serious tone and have a touch of melancholy.. the characters they play in this movie, are exactly that.. The stand out performance in the movie is that of Glenn Close , who has made the character come alive.. Winona Ryder looking stunning and could have been given more screen-time along with Antonio Banderas, both being versatile actors.. The story moves though three generation in just above two hours and you feel it..

    First this movie is a biased interpretation of the history of Chile (based on a book by Isadora Allende---yes related to the communist president who was assassinated). The Allende government like all far left governments quickly shut down the productive economy impoverishing everyone in the process (it had nothing to do with a plot by United Fruit or the evil market economies as suggested in the movie). The movie---I am finally getting there--is lavishly filmed and entertaining I got some amusement by seeing the bad guys win. The novel has some more entertaining subplots like the one involving the "aristocratic" Frenchman who marries the daughter in the book. Look all in all it is entertaining has wonderful actors and if you love Chile you will enjoy it--just ignore the pounding political correctness.

    I had the pleasure of catching this movie on Netflix after almost 13+ years. I was only 14 the last time my cousin, sister and I had sat together one warm summer afternoon and watched this on HBO. After that I didn't remember the name of the movie, just knew enough to know that Meryl Streep was in it. The movie made a mark on my childhood, I was deeply engrossed by the mystical capabilities on Streep. Her poignance and courage in the movie paved the way for much of the artsy feeling I enjoyed. Years later I still love the movie, frankly because it brought back memories of my childhood and I got a chance to relive it all.

    To capture the rich complexity and the intensity of a novel by Isabel Allende is not an easy task; however, it is one that Bille August attempts to do with the film version of Allende's "The House of Spirits." Jam-packed with a stunning cast, including Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and Winona Ryder, the film covers a span of around 70 years, giving us a glimpse of the different aspects of the family's life that shapes who they become as the film progresses. Although the acting is well done and the storyline enticing, I sometimes felt lost between the large jumps in time, as well as the various side stories that were only surfaced upon, such as that with the other son. I feel that in order to truly capture the complexity of Allende's novel, the film would have to be long enough to delve into each character and their respective stories with much more detail.

    Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words:"The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint, the tainted sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers, cognitive and mediumistic, this hardened woman, loyal to his blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., the bastard child of Senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. The film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.

Thank goodness films like this occasionally get made. I know it sounds as if I just contradicted myself, but just because it was a bomb, didn't mean that it's not a fine film. And the strength of this film are the performances. The strongest of the performances is by Glenn Close, who plays the lead male's sister who has lesbian inclinations. She's been treated unfairly her whole life and suffers for most of it. A strong, strong performance. Next is Meryl Streep. Just about as good as always as the psychic wife of the male lead. Then we come to Jeremy Irons. Hmmmmm. I have mixed feelings here. Irons' character here is so despicable that you know he will get his comeuppance before the movie ends. Is it wise to be that obvious? To play it that "hard"? I think not. So I'll reserve judgment here simply because, typically, Irons is a wonderful actor. In supporting roles, the most notable are those of Winona Ryder as the daughter and Antonio Banderas as her poor lover. Both do great jobs. I enjoyed seeing Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl as the parents of Streep, but they didn't get enough screen time. Now as to the script. It's good...perhaps a tad slow in a few places. But character development is rather thorough. The story is of a relatively poor young man who falls in love, but works to strike gold in order to marry a relatively rich girl. He does, but she dies. So, eventually he marries her sister (Streep), who doesn't talk...by her own choice. She does talk with him, however, and for a while they have a happy life. But he is a bitter shell of a man who has become a patrone who treats pretty much everyone harshly, always insisting he is boss. You know, as I mentioned earlier, that he will get his comeuppance, but it's cleverly done here in a way that combines personal tragedy with the history of so many South American countries. Although it's never made clear in the film, the country depicted is Chile. A special note should be made of the makeup used to age the main characters. It's done very well here...a much better job than in a lot of films. I recommend this film IF you like serious movies. Otherwise, it may bore you. I found it rather compelling.

    The House Of The Spirits would be be for the 18 crowd. I found this movie to be a tedious and rather pointless movie. To me, I saw little purpose in this movie. There are many actors and actresses which I love to see are in this movie. Stars such as Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave and Antonio Banderas are in this flick. The House Of Spirits is a long movie. I believe that 20 minutes could have been edited out. Yes, The House of the Spirits movie does give one insight as to how people in Chile live. I was disappointed to have so many of my favorite stars in a pointless film. This is definitely a movie to have on TV and play cards to or have another activity going on. If you don't have anything else to do but relax, watch it. I give The House Of the Spirits three thumbs up.

    2013 - and I have never even heard of this movie !!!! What a surprise ! The Book must have been fantastic because the movie is such a journey through the lives of this Chilean family. Jeromy Irons is extremely good, Wynona Ryder plays her part well, Meryl Streep as always is excellent and to think she was only 50 at the time, she plays an excellent Matriarc, Antonia Banderas's part is limited perhaps Melanie Griffiths didn't want him too close to Wynona ???????? I thought the had great on screen appeal as a couple. all in all it is a movie I will recommend to others - simply can't believe I had not heard of it before now. If this is a true interpretation of the era in Chile, I am so glad I live in Australia.

    I have always been a fan of Jeremy Irons and I am yet to find anybody who is not one of Meryl Streep.. They particularly excel if the roles are of serious tone and have a touch of melancholy.. the characters they play in this movie, are exactly that.. The stand out performance in the movie is that of Glenn Close , who has made the character come alive.. Winona Ryder looking stunning and could have been given more screen-time along with Antonio Banderas, both being versatile actors.. The story moves though three generation in just above two hours and you feel it..

    First this movie is a biased interpretation of the history of Chile (based on a book by Isadora Allende---yes related to the communist president who was assassinated). The Allende government like all far left governments quickly shut down the productive economy impoverishing everyone in the process (it had nothing to do with a plot by United Fruit or the evil market economies as suggested in the movie). The movie---I am finally getting there--is lavishly filmed and entertaining I got some amusement by seeing the bad guys win. The novel has some more entertaining subplots like the one involving the "aristocratic" Frenchman who marries the daughter in the book. Look all in all it is entertaining has wonderful actors and if you love Chile you will enjoy it--just ignore the pounding political correctness.

    I had the pleasure of catching this movie on Netflix after almost 13+ years. I was only 14 the last time my cousin, sister and I had sat together one warm summer afternoon and watched this on HBO. After that I didn't remember the name of the movie, just knew enough to know that Meryl Streep was in it. The movie made a mark on my childhood, I was deeply engrossed by the mystical capabilities on Streep. Her poignance and courage in the movie paved the way for much of the artsy feeling I enjoyed. Years later I still love the movie, frankly because it brought back memories of my childhood and I got a chance to relive it all.

    To capture the rich complexity and the intensity of a novel by Isabel Allende is not an easy task; however, it is one that Bille August attempts to do with the film version of Allende's "The House of Spirits." Jam-packed with a stunning cast, including Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and Winona Ryder, the film covers a span of around 70 years, giving us a glimpse of the different aspects of the family's life that shapes who they become as the film progresses. Although the acting is well done and the storyline enticing, I sometimes felt lost between the large jumps in time, as well as the various side stories that were only surfaced upon, such as that with the other son. I feel that in order to truly capture the complexity of Allende's novel, the film would have to be long enough to delve into each character and their respective stories with much more detail.

    Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words:"The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint, the tainted sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers, cognitive and mediumistic, this hardened woman, loyal to his blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., the bastard child of Senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. The film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.

    For whatever The House Of The Spirits draws in criticism, it has one overriding virtue. Among the many things that Americans are deficient in knowledge about is South America. This film and the book by Isabel Allende give us an insight into Chile and their society. Not something that in news, literature, or cinema that we deal with all the time. Unlike many South American countries Chile had a long democratic tradition until the coup that toppled President Allende in 1973. As a society it was not a series of military dictatorships as other countries. It was also a prosperous country. But one where prosperity was reserved for a few. This film is the story of the rags to riches rise of Ernesto Trueba as played by Jeremy Irons. He does it like so many in America do, he marries it and in this case it's Meryl Streep, a woman who has psychic powers which she has contained since childhood lest she be regarded as a freak. Irons marries her and they have a daughter that grows up to be Winona Ryder. Irons is our central character and like many who rise from poverty even in this country they want to make sure that even the hint of it never touches their person or their families. He's one nasty Padrone and makes sure everyone knows he's not one of them any more. And like a medieval lord he takes his pleasures wherever while always maintaining a respectable married front. One of those 'pleasures' gives him a nasty surprise in the end. And of course he doesn't want daughter Ryder mixing with any of the peasant kids. When she has an affair with Antonio Banderas who has been radicalized it's not something that Irons can abide. The period of Chilean history takes us from the 30s right through the right wing coup against Allende and its aftermath with Pinochet military dictatorship. Irons becomes a Chilean Senator of their Conservative party. But while his party approves of the coup Irons survives to learn that old maxim about being careful what you wish for. He finds being a Senator carries very little wait among the members of the Pinochet junta. Meryl Streep turns in a fine performance as his wife and her talents for clairvoyance and levitation seem kind of superfluous to the main story. This film clearly belongs to Jeremy Irons. The House Of The Spirits is a well constructed film with some moving performances and is recommended highly for those who want some insights into Chilean history and culture.

    The House Of The Spirits would be be for the 18 crowd. I found this movie to be a tedious and rather pointless movie. To me, I saw little purpose in this movie. There are many actors and actresses which I love to see are in this movie. Stars such as Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave and Antonio Banderas are in this flick. The House Of Spirits is a long movie. I believe that 20 minutes could have been edited out. Yes, The House of the Spirits movie does give one insight as to how people in Chile live. I was disappointed to have so many of my favorite stars in a pointless film. This is definitely a movie to have on TV and play cards to or have another activity going on. If you don't have anything else to do but relax, watch it. I give The House Of the Spirits three thumbs up.

    2013 - and I have never even heard of this movie !!!! What a surprise ! The Book must have been fantastic because the movie is such a journey through the lives of this Chilean family. Jeromy Irons is extremely good, Wynona Ryder plays her part well, Meryl Streep as always is excellent and to think she was only 50 at the time, she plays an excellent Matriarc, Antonia Banderas's part is limited perhaps Melanie Griffiths didn't want him too close to Wynona ???????? I thought the had great on screen appeal as a couple. all in all it is a movie I will recommend to others - simply can't believe I had not heard of it before now. If this is a true interpretation of the era in Chile, I am so glad I live in Australia.

    I have always been a fan of Jeremy Irons and I am yet to find anybody who is not one of Meryl Streep.. They particularly excel if the roles are of serious tone and have a touch of melancholy.. the characters they play in this movie, are exactly that.. The stand out performance in the movie is that of Glenn Close , who has made the character come alive.. Winona Ryder looking stunning and could have been given more screen-time along with Antonio Banderas, both being versatile actors.. The story moves though three generation in just above two hours and you feel it..

    First this movie is a biased interpretation of the history of Chile (based on a book by Isadora Allende---yes related to the communist president who was assassinated). The Allende government like all far left governments quickly shut down the productive economy impoverishing everyone in the process (it had nothing to do with a plot by United Fruit or the evil market economies as suggested in the movie). The movie---I am finally getting there--is lavishly filmed and entertaining I got some amusement by seeing the bad guys win. The novel has some more entertaining subplots like the one involving the "aristocratic" Frenchman who marries the daughter in the book. Look all in all it is entertaining has wonderful actors and if you love Chile you will enjoy it--just ignore the pounding political correctness.

    I had the pleasure of catching this movie on Netflix after almost 13+ years. I was only 14 the last time my cousin, sister and I had sat together one warm summer afternoon and watched this on HBO. After that I didn't remember the name of the movie, just knew enough to know that Meryl Streep was in it. The movie made a mark on my childhood, I was deeply engrossed by the mystical capabilities on Streep. Her poignance and courage in the movie paved the way for much of the artsy feeling I enjoyed. Years later I still love the movie, frankly because it brought back memories of my childhood and I got a chance to relive it all.

    To capture the rich complexity and the intensity of a novel by Isabel Allende is not an easy task; however, it is one that Bille August attempts to do with the film version of Allende's "The House of Spirits." Jam-packed with a stunning cast, including Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and Winona Ryder, the film covers a span of around 70 years, giving us a glimpse of the different aspects of the family's life that shapes who they become as the film progresses. Although the acting is well done and the storyline enticing, I sometimes felt lost between the large jumps in time, as well as the various side stories that were only surfaced upon, such as that with the other son. I feel that in order to truly capture the complexity of Allende's novel, the film would have to be long enough to delve into each character and their respective stories with much more detail.

    Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words:"The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint, the tainted sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers, cognitive and mediumistic, this hardened woman, loyal to his blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., the bastard child of Senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. The film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.

    For whatever The House Of The Spirits draws in criticism, it has one overriding virtue. Among the many things that Americans are deficient in knowledge about is South America. This film and the book by Isabel Allende give us an insight into Chile and their society. Not something that in news, literature, or cinema that we deal with all the time. Unlike many South American countries Chile had a long democratic tradition until the coup that toppled President Allende in 1973. As a society it was not a series of military dictatorships as other countries. It was also a prosperous country. But one where prosperity was reserved for a few. This film is the story of the rags to riches rise of Ernesto Trueba as played by Jeremy Irons. He does it like so many in America do, he marries it and in this case it's Meryl Streep, a woman who has psychic powers which she has contained since childhood lest she be regarded as a freak. Irons marries her and they have a daughter that grows up to be Winona Ryder. Irons is our central character and like many who rise from poverty even in this country they want to make sure that even the hint of it never touches their person or their families. He's one nasty Padrone and makes sure everyone knows he's not one of them any more. And like a medieval lord he takes his pleasures wherever while always maintaining a respectable married front. One of those 'pleasures' gives him a nasty surprise in the end. And of course he doesn't want daughter Ryder mixing with any of the peasant kids. When she has an affair with Antonio Banderas who has been radicalized it's not something that Irons can abide. The period of Chilean history takes us from the 30s right through the right wing coup against Allende and its aftermath with Pinochet military dictatorship. Irons becomes a Chilean Senator of their Conservative party. But while his party approves of the coup Irons survives to learn that old maxim about being careful what you wish for. He finds being a Senator carries very little wait among the members of the Pinochet junta. Meryl Streep turns in a fine performance as his wife and her talents for clairvoyance and levitation seem kind of superfluous to the main story. This film clearly belongs to Jeremy Irons. The House Of The Spirits is a well constructed film with some moving performances and is recommended highly for those who want some insights into Chilean history and culture.

    This film was a bomb, losing millions of dollars. And I'm not surprised. It's a very serious film which would be likely to attract a very specific and small audience. Thank goodness films like this occasionally get made. I know it sounds as if I just contradicted myself, but just because it was a bomb, didn't mean that it's not a fine film. And the strength of this film are the performances. The strongest of the performances is by Glenn Close, who plays the lead male's sister who has lesbian inclinations. She's been treated unfairly her whole life and suffers for most of it. A strong, strong performance. Next is Meryl Streep. Just about as good as always as the psychic wife of the male lead. Then we come to Jeremy Irons. Hmmmmm. I have mixed feelings here. Irons' character here is so despicable that you know he will get his comeuppance before the movie ends. Is it wise to be that obvious? To play it that "hard"? I think not. So I'll reserve judgment here simply because, typically, Irons is a wonderful actor. In supporting roles, the most notable are those of Winona Ryder as the daughter and Antonio Banderas as her poor lover. Both do great jobs. I enjoyed seeing Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl as the parents of Streep, but they didn't get enough screen time. Now as to the script. It's good...perhaps a tad slow in a few places. But character development is rather thorough. The story is of a relatively poor young man who falls in love, but works to strike gold in order to marry a relatively rich girl. He does, but she dies. So, eventually he marries her sister (Streep), who doesn't talk...by her own choice. She does talk with him, however, and for a while they have a happy life. But he is a bitter shell of a man who has become a patrone who treats pretty much everyone harshly, always insisting he is boss. You know, as I mentioned earlier, that he will get his comeuppance, but it's cleverly done here in a way that combines personal tragedy with the history of so many South American countries. Although it's never made clear in the film, the country depicted is Chile. A special note should be made of the makeup used to age the main characters. It's done very well here...a much better job than in a lot of films. I recommend this film IF you like serious movies. Otherwise, it may bore you. I found it rather compelling.
