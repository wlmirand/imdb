 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The town of Big Whisky is full of normal people trying to lead quiet lives. Cowboys try to make a living. Sheriff 'Little Bill' tries to build a house and keep a heavy-handed order. The town whores just try to get by.Then a couple of cowboys cut up a whore. Unsatisfied with Bill's justice, the prostitutes put a bounty on the cowboys. The bounty attracts a young gun billing himself as 'The Schofield Kid', and aging killer William Munny. Munny reformed for his young wife, and has been raising crops and two children in peace. But his wife is gone. Farm life is hard. And Munny is no good at it. So he calls his old partner Ned, saddles his ornery nag, and rides off to kill one more time, blurring the lines between heroism and villainy, man and myth.

    A western that completely defies the entire myth of the Old Wild West, Unforgiven presents Clint Eastwood in command both in front & behind the camera and is a fine drama depicting the dusk of a genre. It tells the story of a retired merciless assassin named William Munny (Clint Eastwood), who ties up his laces for one last time when a young bloke comes up with an offer of joining with him for a bounty of a thousand dollars after which Will invites one of his old partners, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) with him. The film boasts three powerful performances by Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Gene Hackman but what sets this western apart from others is that it does not glorify violence but a complete reversal of that. Nicely filmed & firmly executed, Unforgiven is Eastwood's homage to Sergio Leone's westerns and is a bold statement against its own heritage & a superb tale of moral ambiguity.

    I haven't seen many westerns being honest ; they were quite a bit before my time but this one movie has re-fuelled my interest in the entire genre ; its that good. Eastwood directs this and he does an impeccable job with expert pacing, genuine thrills and plenty of tension. Hackman is your ideal villain ; brutal yet intelligent to a degree and he steals every scene he's in. Whenever he's on screen you can feel the suspension in the atmosphere ; he is such an intimidating individual. And did I mention this movie has Morgan Freeman in ? The cast is just pure class and everyone plays their roles to perfection. However, although the story revolves around the women at the bar, I felt that they featured a little too much in the movie, ever so slightly taking the limelight away from our hero, Clint. The story does take a little while to get going it must be admitted , but once your sucked in it will have your attention right until the grand finale. 'Unforgiven' is only one of three westerns to win the Oscar for 'best picture' and you can understand why. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie , the best of the Eastwood era.

    So yeah, another review by the guy that makes reviews for you, the guy that is searching for a movie to watch! Lets get to it: I gave 9 to the movie because it has a ending and it was so good by the time it reached the end that I really wanted more. So why should you watch this movie and when? You should watch this movie if you are feeling western! This movie has the western structure well developed: a main group of 'outlaws' that are searching to do good as well as some bastard folk that want just the opposite. That resumes why you should watch this if you came here feeling western... but and the other reasons? This movie has a thing that I love in movies: good characters! All of them have more than just a image, they are deep, they have back stories and they live to them in non obvious ways. The characters show their guts! Finally for the bad, maybe the ending of the movie was too dark for the camera? Or that was something wanted because of the meaning of seeing little. Still, the end could be a bit different with some more loose ends. That would make this a western masterpiece.

On his way back to survival, he marches along with his old time pal and a new rookie assassin. He encounters a cop (Hackman) who is trying to shoo away assassins from the country and prevent any further killing. What is characterised by a slow buildup, the ending is not as dramatic and shies away from any over the top action. Yet for its subtlety I would give the movie the above ratings. Acting - Eastwood,Freeman and Hackman do a wonderful job, with excellent dialogue delivery and great character.

    Unforgiven An outstanding movie to capture the old west, if you expect to see a Spaghetti Western you might be disappointed the way I see it is a beautiful last chapter to the Man with no name, which Sergio Leone created back in 1964. Clint Eastwood as Director I feel he did a outstanding job to show a man who was a thief and a killer. where his wife changing his life around, I won't say any more than that. Every Character feels authentic that they belong in the old west. Morgan Freeman Is fantastic as always, Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek are the real sand outs for me.

    I never got what is so great about this movie. At least other Eastwood Westerns could entertain. Even "Pale Rider", a pale hybrid of "Shane" and "High Plains Drifter", was better than this, entertainment wise. Whatever message of anti-violence in the film made no impression on me. John Wayne's final film "The Shootist" was better at that with the last scene in the saloon where Ron Howard throws the gun away and John Wayne nods in agreement and dies. Certainly the director of that movie, Don Siegel, were he still alive at the time, would have done a better job with "Unforgiven", as he had as director of earlier Eastwood films. It was only Eastwood's aging that allowed him to make this particular kind of Western, and with that aging came a consistent decline of quality in his output. Not that any of his movies are all that great to begin with. None of them inspire. Not even this "message" Western. It needed a much more involving story to relay its "message".

    Money must have a lot to do with the story of "Unforgiven" because it's the name of the lead character, William Munny, just spelled different (writers are clever like that). William Munny is, by his own admission, a heartless murderer of everything that ever walked or crawled, women and children included. But it's only because he was bad, wickedly bad, and it seems he was drunk, real drunk, most of the time. And so bad and drunk, he murdered people, lots of people. But that was then, he's a changed man now, everybody deserves a second chance, even heartless drunken murderers. But old (and bad) habits die hard, as hard as a gut-shot cowboy. You see, William Munny needs money, and there's money in killing people, a thousand dollars in this particular instance. He needs the money because he's getting old and he's all muddy and so are his kids, all muddy and dirty, and he's the sole caretaker of those two muddy dirty little kids, and another pig, ANOTHER PIG, has fever. OK, so killing pays and William Munny has experience enough, and a thousand dollars is a lot of money, so who needs to be killed, and why? Is it a legal bounty on a fugitive, dead or alive? Nope, it's entirely ILLEGAL, it's not a bounty it's a contract killing, it's murder for hire. You see, a whore got cut up by some drunken cowboy who didn't think it was funny that the whore he was paying would insult his manhood (if you know what I mean), and the local whore Union wasn't satisfied that justice had been done for the laughing cut-up whore, and so a contract was put out by the Union, for the murder of two cowboys... I'm not sure why two cowboys, maybe they both cut her up, it was pretty dark, maybe they took turns (it is a whorehouse). And so William Munny is going to murder the two cowboys for the whores, for a thousand dollars, not because he really wants to but because ANOTHER PIG has fever. But wait, if you thought all you would get for your enjoyment was two lousy murders, no way, William Munny deals in bulk and volume, he kills everything that walks or crawls, and so once he starts in drinking again, BANG! He kills the guy who owns the whorehouse/saloon (because of how the place is decorated), and that's OK because that guy was ugly and greasy and he owns a whorehouse... But William Munny also kills the Sheriff and just about the whole danged Sheriff's Department, including the one-armed Deputy and young Deputy Andy and the fat Deputy too (shot in the back). And after William Munny shot them all, and with the one-armed Deputy still barely alive groaning to lift his gun up, Munny shot him again (in what seemed like the groin) just for the fun of it I guess. Why did he shoot all those people, what did Andy and one-arm and fat man do to deserve being murdered? Nothing as far as I know, but William Munny (and Clint Eastwood) shoot people, lots of people, and they do it for money, lots of money. A Great American Hero, William Munny or Clint Eastwood or both. Whores everywhere are safer tonight, they have their avenger, and all it cost was a thousand dollars. Also, it's implied in the heartwarming epilogue that the dirty kids got cleaned up and moved out of that pig sty, and Pa invested well in Dry Goods, and everybody lived happily ever after except all the cowboys and Deputies and Sheriff who got gunned down in a drunken murderous cold-blooded shooting rampage. And the PIG? His fever broke, whatever it was it passed, and so of course they slaughtered him... "Because bacon taste's GOOD, pork chops taste GOOD!"

    I agree that this is a great Western movie of the 20th Century -- it is certainly not typical with the reason for the Action and Conflict being the aggrieved women themselves. The cast of characters as developed by David Webb Peoples and director/producer Clint Eastwood are a sordid bunch. We see the earthy and grim parts of a lot of the "Wild West" and learn that Gun Control is not just a measure of the contemporary U.S. political groupings. I don't quite think that the main character is an anti-hero but he does seem a bit like a reformed addict pushed to the breaking point. It is not for the young and over-sensitive. UNFORGIVEN (1992) is a good example of a two-hour feature that doesn't need the big tech-effects to keep us thrilled and on the edges of our seats. It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the "bad" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an "8" *

    I won't add much to what have already told the other users. They have all explained. Far better than i'll do. YES YES YES, that's the best Clint Eastwood's film ever made. As an actor, I mean; although as a director, it's ALSO a masterpiece. But as an actor, I have never liked Clint; always the same kind of characters, except maybe in HONKYTONK MAN and WHITE HUNTER... where he gives us unpredictable performances. But in his westerns, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, PALE RIDER, I hate his characters, all alike. In Harry Calahan, well...Nearly the same too. So, in UNFORGIVEN, his character is really different. A genuine bad guy who plays the good guy. Gene Hackman is here the perfect contrary. The good town sheriff who protects his fellow citizens and plays "the bad guy". Don't forget Eastwood's characters's sentence, just before he kills Hackman: "Yes, I have killed women and children..." Have you ever heard a hero say this in a movie? In this movie everything is mixed up, if you compare to other films of this kind. And that's what I love. No real hero here. A pure masterpiece.

    Unforgiven is an excellent film that probably would get a B+ rating for me for most of the film until it got to its astonishing climax that is one of the best ever. The film is good with its characters, story, and the killer climax. The film begins with a reading of what happened with William Munny and what he was and who helped him changed. Then it goes to present day and we meet William Munny and an offer to help give him money to help his family, but involves going back to killing. As two cowboys assaulted a prostitute and sliced her up. He accepts because he needs to money and gathers his old partner, Ned, to help with the killing. The film has some very good characters with Eastwood as the changed trying to stay true to his new self but changes when Ned is killed and he is filled with rage. Freeman is good as Ned, a crack shot but talks big with the Kid as the kid tries to act tough. Hackman was excellent as the mean sheriff who is the big tough guy of town and dares people with his and their lives. The story is a good complex story that is pretty good to follow and is done very well. The best part is its climax when Eastwood goes to town for the revenge of the death of Ned. He goes in the bar where there is some sort of meeting with Hackman there and most of the other cowboys, in fact all of them pretty much. He shoots the bar tender and then Hackman before shooting up the bar and watching the others flee. Hackman then tries to attack one more time but is killed for good. Then as Eastwood leaves, he threatens the people who are living to not touch with or he'll kill them, and their family, and the town. The film is one of the best westerns ever and one of my favorite Eastwood movies ever. Me: 4.5/5 Audience: 4.15/5

A genuine bad guy who plays the good guy. Gene Hackman is here the perfect contrary. The good town sheriff who protects his fellow citizens and plays "the bad guy". Don't forget Eastwood's characters's sentence, just before he kills Hackman: "Yes, I have killed women and children..." Have you ever heard a hero say this in a movie? In this movie everything is mixed up, if you compare to other films of this kind. And that's what I love. No real hero here. A pure masterpiece.

    Unforgiven is an excellent film that probably would get a B+ rating for me for most of the film until it got to its astonishing climax that is one of the best ever. The film is good with its characters, story, and the killer climax. The film begins with a reading of what happened with William Munny and what he was and who helped him changed. Then it goes to present day and we meet William Munny and an offer to help give him money to help his family, but involves going back to killing. As two cowboys assaulted a prostitute and sliced her up. He accepts because he needs to money and gathers his old partner, Ned, to help with the killing. The film has some very good characters with Eastwood as the changed trying to stay true to his new self but changes when Ned is killed and he is filled with rage. Freeman is good as Ned, a crack shot but talks big with the Kid as the kid tries to act tough. Hackman was excellent as the mean sheriff who is the big tough guy of town and dares people with his and their lives. The story is a good complex story that is pretty good to follow and is done very well. The best part is its climax when Eastwood goes to town for the revenge of the death of Ned. He goes in the bar where there is some sort of meeting with Hackman there and most of the other cowboys, in fact all of them pretty much. He shoots the bar tender and then Hackman before shooting up the bar and watching the others flee. Hackman then tries to attack one more time but is killed for good. Then as Eastwood leaves, he threatens the people who are living to not touch with or he'll kill them, and their family, and the town. The film is one of the best westerns ever and one of my favorite Eastwood movies ever. Me: 4.5/5 Audience: 4.15/5

    A western that completely defies the entire myth of the Old Wild West, Unforgiven presents Clint Eastwood in command both in front & behind the camera and is a fine drama depicting the dusk of a genre. It tells the story of a retired merciless assassin named William Munny (Clint Eastwood), who ties up his laces for one last time when a young bloke comes up with an offer of joining with him for a bounty of a thousand dollars after which Will invites one of his old partners, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) with him. The film boasts three powerful performances by Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Gene Hackman but what sets this western apart from others is that it does not glorify violence but a complete reversal of that. Nicely filmed & firmly executed, Unforgiven is Eastwood's homage to Sergio Leone's westerns and is a bold statement against its own heritage & a superb tale of moral ambiguity.

    I haven't seen many westerns being honest ; they were quite a bit before my time but this one movie has re-fuelled my interest in the entire genre ; its that good. Eastwood directs this and he does an impeccable job with expert pacing, genuine thrills and plenty of tension. Hackman is your ideal villain ; brutal yet intelligent to a degree and he steals every scene he's in. Whenever he's on screen you can feel the suspension in the atmosphere ; he is such an intimidating individual. And did I mention this movie has Morgan Freeman in ? The cast is just pure class and everyone plays their roles to perfection. However, although the story revolves around the women at the bar, I felt that they featured a little too much in the movie, ever so slightly taking the limelight away from our hero, Clint. The story does take a little while to get going it must be admitted , but once your sucked in it will have your attention right until the grand finale. 'Unforgiven' is only one of three westerns to win the Oscar for 'best picture' and you can understand why. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie , the best of the Eastwood era.

    So yeah, another review by the guy that makes reviews for you, the guy that is searching for a movie to watch! Lets get to it: I gave 9 to the movie because it has a ending and it was so good by the time it reached the end that I really wanted more. So why should you watch this movie and when? You should watch this movie if you are feeling western! This movie has the western structure well developed: a main group of 'outlaws' that are searching to do good as well as some bastard folk that want just the opposite. That resumes why you should watch this if you came here feeling western... but and the other reasons? This movie has a thing that I love in movies: good characters! All of them have more than just a image, they are deep, they have back stories and they live to them in non obvious ways. The characters show their guts! Finally for the bad, maybe the ending of the movie was too dark for the camera? Or that was something wanted because of the meaning of seeing little. Still, the end could be a bit different with some more loose ends. That would make this a western masterpiece.

What is characterised by a slow buildup, the ending is not as dramatic and shies away from any over the top action. Yet for its subtlety I would give the movie the above ratings.

    Unforgiven An outstanding movie to capture the old west, if you expect to see a Spaghetti Western you might be disappointed the way I see it is a beautiful last chapter to the Man with no name, which Sergio Leone created back in 1964. Clint Eastwood as Director I feel he did a outstanding job to show a man who was a thief and a killer. where his wife changing his life around, I won't say any more than that. Every Character feels authentic that they belong in the old west. Morgan Freeman Is fantastic as always, Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek are the real sand outs for me.

    I never got what is so great about this movie. At least other Eastwood Westerns could entertain. Even "Pale Rider", a pale hybrid of "Shane" and "High Plains Drifter", was better than this, entertainment wise. Whatever message of anti-violence in the film made no impression on me. John Wayne's final film "The Shootist" was better at that with the last scene in the saloon where Ron Howard throws the gun away and John Wayne nods in agreement and dies. Certainly the director of that movie, Don Siegel, were he still alive at the time, would have done a better job with "Unforgiven", as he had as director of earlier Eastwood films. It was only Eastwood's aging that allowed him to make this particular kind of Western, and with that aging came a consistent decline of quality in his output. Not that any of his movies are all that great to begin with. None of them inspire. Not even this "message" Western. It needed a much more involving story to relay its "message".

    Money must have a lot to do with the story of "Unforgiven" because it's the name of the lead character, William Munny, just spelled different (writers are clever like that). William Munny is, by his own admission, a heartless murderer of everything that ever walked or crawled, women and children included. But it's only because he was bad, wickedly bad, and it seems he was drunk, real drunk, most of the time. And so bad and drunk, he murdered people, lots of people. But that was then, he's a changed man now, everybody deserves a second chance, even heartless drunken murderers. But old (and bad) habits die hard, as hard as a gut-shot cowboy. You see, William Munny needs money, and there's money in killing people, a thousand dollars in this particular instance. He needs the money because he's getting old and he's all muddy and so are his kids, all muddy and dirty, and he's the sole caretaker of those two muddy dirty little kids, and another pig, ANOTHER PIG, has fever. OK, so killing pays and William Munny has experience enough, and a thousand dollars is a lot of money, so who needs to be killed, and why? Is it a legal bounty on a fugitive, dead or alive? Nope, it's entirely ILLEGAL, it's not a bounty it's a contract killing, it's murder for hire. You see, a whore got cut up by some drunken cowboy who didn't think it was funny that the whore he was paying would insult his manhood (if you know what I mean), and the local whore Union wasn't satisfied that justice had been done for the laughing cut-up whore, and so a contract was put out by the Union, for the murder of two cowboys... I'm not sure why two cowboys, maybe they both cut her up, it was pretty dark, maybe they took turns (it is a whorehouse). And so William Munny is going to murder the two cowboys for the whores, for a thousand dollars, not because he really wants to but because ANOTHER PIG has fever. But wait, if you thought all you would get for your enjoyment was two lousy murders, no way, William Munny deals in bulk and volume, he kills everything that walks or crawls, and so once he starts in drinking again, BANG! He kills the guy who owns the whorehouse/saloon (because of how the place is decorated), and that's OK because that guy was ugly and greasy and he owns a whorehouse... But William Munny also kills the Sheriff and just about the whole danged Sheriff's Department, including the one-armed Deputy and young Deputy Andy and the fat Deputy too (shot in the back). And after William Munny shot them all, and with the one-armed Deputy still barely alive groaning to lift his gun up, Munny shot him again (in what seemed like the groin) just for the fun of it I guess. Why did he shoot all those people, what did Andy and one-arm and fat man do to deserve being murdered? Nothing as far as I know, but William Munny (and Clint Eastwood) shoot people, lots of people, and they do it for money, lots of money. A Great American Hero, William Munny or Clint Eastwood or both. Whores everywhere are safer tonight, they have their avenger, and all it cost was a thousand dollars. Also, it's implied in the heartwarming epilogue that the dirty kids got cleaned up and moved out of that pig sty, and Pa invested well in Dry Goods, and everybody lived happily ever after except all the cowboys and Deputies and Sheriff who got gunned down in a drunken murderous cold-blooded shooting rampage. And the PIG? His fever broke, whatever it was it passed, and so of course they slaughtered him... "Because bacon taste's GOOD, pork chops taste GOOD!"

    I agree that this is a great Western movie of the 20th Century -- it is certainly not typical with the reason for the Action and Conflict being the aggrieved women themselves. The cast of characters as developed by David Webb Peoples and director/producer Clint Eastwood are a sordid bunch. We see the earthy and grim parts of a lot of the "Wild West" and learn that Gun Control is not just a measure of the contemporary U.S. political groupings. I don't quite think that the main character is an anti-hero but he does seem a bit like a reformed addict pushed to the breaking point. It is not for the young and over-sensitive. UNFORGIVEN (1992) is a good example of a two-hour feature that doesn't need the big tech-effects to keep us thrilled and on the edges of our seats. It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the "bad" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an "8" *

    I won't add much to what have already told the other users. They have all explained. Far better than i'll do. YES YES YES, that's the best Clint Eastwood's film ever made. As an actor, I mean; although as a director, it's ALSO a masterpiece. But as an actor, I have never liked Clint; always the same kind of characters, except maybe in HONKYTONK MAN and WHITE HUNTER... where he gives us unpredictable performances. But in his westerns, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, PALE RIDER, I hate his characters, all alike. In Harry Calahan, well...Nearly the same too. So, in UNFORGIVEN, his character is really different.

    I won't add much to what have already told the other users. They have all explained. Far better than i'll do. YES YES YES, that's the best Clint Eastwood's film ever made. As an actor, I mean; although as a director, it's ALSO a masterpiece. But as an actor, I have never liked Clint; always the same kind of characters, except maybe in HONKYTONK MAN and WHITE HUNTER... where he gives us unpredictable performances. But in his westerns, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, PALE RIDER, I hate his characters, all alike. In Harry Calahan, well...Nearly the same too. So, in UNFORGIVEN, his character is really different. A genuine bad guy who plays the good guy. Gene Hackman is here the perfect contrary. The good town sheriff who protects his fellow citizens and plays "the bad guy". Don't forget Eastwood's characters's sentence, just before he kills Hackman: "Yes, I have killed women and children..." Have you ever heard a hero say this in a movie? In this movie everything is mixed up, if you compare to other films of this kind. And that's what I love. No real hero here. A pure masterpiece.

    Unforgiven is an excellent film that probably would get a B+ rating for me for most of the film until it got to its astonishing climax that is one of the best ever. The film is good with its characters, story, and the killer climax. The film begins with a reading of what happened with William Munny and what he was and who helped him changed. Then it goes to present day and we meet William Munny and an offer to help give him money to help his family, but involves going back to killing. As two cowboys assaulted a prostitute and sliced her up. He accepts because he needs to money and gathers his old partner, Ned, to help with the killing. The film has some very good characters with Eastwood as the changed trying to stay true to his new self but changes when Ned is killed and he is filled with rage. Freeman is good as Ned, a crack shot but talks big with the Kid as the kid tries to act tough. Hackman was excellent as the mean sheriff who is the big tough guy of town and dares people with his and their lives. The story is a good complex story that is pretty good to follow and is done very well. The best part is its climax when Eastwood goes to town for the revenge of the death of Ned. He goes in the bar where there is some sort of meeting with Hackman there and most of the other cowboys, in fact all of them pretty much. He shoots the bar tender and then Hackman before shooting up the bar and watching the others flee. Hackman then tries to attack one more time but is killed for good. Then as Eastwood leaves, he threatens the people who are living to not touch with or he'll kill them, and their family, and the town. The film is one of the best westerns ever and one of my favorite Eastwood movies ever. Me: 4.5/5 Audience: 4.15/5

    A western that completely defies the entire myth of the Old Wild West, Unforgiven presents Clint Eastwood in command both in front & behind the camera and is a fine drama depicting the dusk of a genre. It tells the story of a retired merciless assassin named William Munny (Clint Eastwood), who ties up his laces for one last time when a young bloke comes up with an offer of joining with him for a bounty of a thousand dollars after which Will invites one of his old partners, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) with him. The film boasts three powerful performances by Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Gene Hackman but what sets this western apart from others is that it does not glorify violence but a complete reversal of that. Nicely filmed & firmly executed, Unforgiven is Eastwood's homage to Sergio Leone's westerns and is a bold statement against its own heritage & a superb tale of moral ambiguity.

    I haven't seen many westerns being honest ; they were quite a bit before my time but this one movie has re-fuelled my interest in the entire genre ; its that good. Eastwood directs this and he does an impeccable job with expert pacing, genuine thrills and plenty of tension. Hackman is your ideal villain ; brutal yet intelligent to a degree and he steals every scene he's in. Whenever he's on screen you can feel the suspension in the atmosphere ; he is such an intimidating individual. And did I mention this movie has Morgan Freeman in ? The cast is just pure class and everyone plays their roles to perfection. However, although the story revolves around the women at the bar, I felt that they featured a little too much in the movie, ever so slightly taking the limelight away from our hero, Clint. The story does take a little while to get going it must be admitted , but once your sucked in it will have your attention right until the grand finale. 'Unforgiven' is only one of three westerns to win the Oscar for 'best picture' and you can understand why. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie , the best of the Eastwood era.

    So yeah, another review by the guy that makes reviews for you, the guy that is searching for a movie to watch! Lets get to it: I gave 9 to the movie because it has a ending and it was so good by the time it reached the end that I really wanted more. So why should you watch this movie and when? You should watch this movie if you are feeling western! This movie has the western structure well developed: a main group of 'outlaws' that are searching to do good as well as some bastard folk that want just the opposite. That resumes why you should watch this if you came here feeling western... but and the other reasons? This movie has a thing that I love in movies: good characters! All of them have more than just a image, they are deep, they have back stories and they live to them in non obvious ways. The characters show their guts! Finally for the bad, maybe the ending of the movie was too dark for the camera? Or that was something wanted because of the meaning of seeing little. Still, the end could be a bit different with some more loose ends. That would make this a western masterpiece.

What is characterised by a slow buildup, the ending is not as dramatic and shies away from any over the top action. Yet for its subtlety I would give the movie the above ratings.

    Unforgiven An outstanding movie to capture the old west, if you expect to see a Spaghetti Western you might be disappointed the way I see it is a beautiful last chapter to the Man with no name, which Sergio Leone created back in 1964. Clint Eastwood as Director I feel he did a outstanding job to show a man who was a thief and a killer. where his wife changing his life around, I won't say any more than that. Every Character feels authentic that they belong in the old west. Morgan Freeman Is fantastic as always, Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek are the real sand outs for me.

    I never got what is so great about this movie. At least other Eastwood Westerns could entertain. Even "Pale Rider", a pale hybrid of "Shane" and "High Plains Drifter", was better than this, entertainment wise. Whatever message of anti-violence in the film made no impression on me. John Wayne's final film "The Shootist" was better at that with the last scene in the saloon where Ron Howard throws the gun away and John Wayne nods in agreement and dies. Certainly the director of that movie, Don Siegel, were he still alive at the time, would have done a better job with "Unforgiven", as he had as director of earlier Eastwood films. It was only Eastwood's aging that allowed him to make this particular kind of Western, and with that aging came a consistent decline of quality in his output. Not that any of his movies are all that great to begin with. None of them inspire. Not even this "message" Western. It needed a much more involving story to relay its "message".

    Money must have a lot to do with the story of "Unforgiven" because it's the name of the lead character, William Munny, just spelled different (writers are clever like that). William Munny is, by his own admission, a heartless murderer of everything that ever walked or crawled, women and children included. But it's only because he was bad, wickedly bad, and it seems he was drunk, real drunk, most of the time. And so bad and drunk, he murdered people, lots of people. But that was then, he's a changed man now, everybody deserves a second chance, even heartless drunken murderers. But old (and bad) habits die hard, as hard as a gut-shot cowboy. You see, William Munny needs money, and there's money in killing people, a thousand dollars in this particular instance. He needs the money because he's getting old and he's all muddy and so are his kids, all muddy and dirty, and he's the sole caretaker of those two muddy dirty little kids, and another pig, ANOTHER PIG, has fever. OK, so killing pays and William Munny has experience enough, and a thousand dollars is a lot of money, so who needs to be killed, and why? Is it a legal bounty on a fugitive, dead or alive? Nope, it's entirely ILLEGAL, it's not a bounty it's a contract killing, it's murder for hire. You see, a whore got cut up by some drunken cowboy who didn't think it was funny that the whore he was paying would insult his manhood (if you know what I mean), and the local whore Union wasn't satisfied that justice had been done for the laughing cut-up whore, and so a contract was put out by the Union, for the murder of two cowboys... I'm not sure why two cowboys, maybe they both cut her up, it was pretty dark, maybe they took turns (it is a whorehouse). And so William Munny is going to murder the two cowboys for the whores, for a thousand dollars, not because he really wants to but because ANOTHER PIG has fever. But wait, if you thought all you would get for your enjoyment was two lousy murders, no way, William Munny deals in bulk and volume, he kills everything that walks or crawls, and so once he starts in drinking again, BANG! He kills the guy who owns the whorehouse/saloon (because of how the place is decorated), and that's OK because that guy was ugly and greasy and he owns a whorehouse... But William Munny also kills the Sheriff and just about the whole danged Sheriff's Department, including the one-armed Deputy and young Deputy Andy and the fat Deputy too (shot in the back). And after William Munny shot them all, and with the one-armed Deputy still barely alive groaning to lift his gun up, Munny shot him again (in what seemed like the groin) just for the fun of it I guess. Why did he shoot all those people, what did Andy and one-arm and fat man do to deserve being murdered? Nothing as far as I know, but William Munny (and Clint Eastwood) shoot people, lots of people, and they do it for money, lots of money. A Great American Hero, William Munny or Clint Eastwood or both. Whores everywhere are safer tonight, they have their avenger, and all it cost was a thousand dollars. Also, it's implied in the heartwarming epilogue that the dirty kids got cleaned up and moved out of that pig sty, and Pa invested well in Dry Goods, and everybody lived happily ever after except all the cowboys and Deputies and Sheriff who got gunned down in a drunken murderous cold-blooded shooting rampage. And the PIG? His fever broke, whatever it was it passed, and so of course they slaughtered him... "Because bacon taste's GOOD, pork chops taste GOOD!"

    I agree that this is a great Western movie of the 20th Century -- it is certainly not typical with the reason for the Action and Conflict being the aggrieved women themselves. The cast of characters as developed by David Webb Peoples and director/producer Clint Eastwood are a sordid bunch. We see the earthy and grim parts of a lot of the "Wild West" and learn that Gun Control is not just a measure of the contemporary U.S. political groupings. I don't quite think that the main character is an anti-hero but he does seem a bit like a reformed addict pushed to the breaking point. It is not for the young and over-sensitive. UNFORGIVEN (1992) is a good example of a two-hour feature that doesn't need the big tech-effects to keep us thrilled and on the edges of our seats. It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the "bad" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an "8" *

    I won't add much to what have already told the other users. They have all explained. Far better than i'll do. YES YES YES, that's the best Clint Eastwood's film ever made. As an actor, I mean; although as a director, it's ALSO a masterpiece. But as an actor, I have never liked Clint; always the same kind of characters, except maybe in HONKYTONK MAN and WHITE HUNTER... where he gives us unpredictable performances. But in his westerns, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, PALE RIDER, I hate his characters, all alike. In Harry Calahan, well...Nearly the same too. So, in UNFORGIVEN, his character is really different. A genuine bad guy who plays the good guy. Gene Hackman is here the perfect contrary. The good town sheriff who protects his fellow citizens and plays "the bad guy". Don't forget Eastwood's characters's sentence, just before he kills Hackman: "Yes, I have killed women and children..." Have you ever heard a hero say this in a movie? In this movie everything is mixed up, if you compare to other films of this kind. And that's what I love. No real hero here. A pure masterpiece.

    Unforgiven is an excellent film that probably would get a B+ rating for me for most of the film until it got to its astonishing climax that is one of the best ever. The film is good with its characters, story, and the killer climax. The film begins with a reading of what happened with William Munny and what he was and who helped him changed. Then it goes to present day and we meet William Munny and an offer to help give him money to help his family, but involves going back to killing. As two cowboys assaulted a prostitute and sliced her up. He accepts because he needs to money and gathers his old partner, Ned, to help with the killing. The film has some very good characters with Eastwood as the changed trying to stay true to his new self but changes when Ned is killed and he is filled with rage. Freeman is good as Ned, a crack shot but talks big with the Kid as the kid tries to act tough. Hackman was excellent as the mean sheriff who is the big tough guy of town and dares people with his and their lives. The story is a good complex story that is pretty good to follow and is done very well. The best part is its climax when Eastwood goes to town for the revenge of the death of Ned. He goes in the bar where there is some sort of meeting with Hackman there and most of the other cowboys, in fact all of them pretty much. He shoots the bar tender and then Hackman before shooting up the bar and watching the others flee. Hackman then tries to attack one more time but is killed for good. Then as Eastwood leaves, he threatens the people who are living to not touch with or he'll kill them, and their family, and the town. The film is one of the best westerns ever and one of my favorite Eastwood movies ever. Me: 4.5/5 Audience: 4.15/5

    A western that completely defies the entire myth of the Old Wild West, Unforgiven presents Clint Eastwood in command both in front & behind the camera and is a fine drama depicting the dusk of a genre. It tells the story of a retired merciless assassin named William Munny (Clint Eastwood), who ties up his laces for one last time when a young bloke comes up with an offer of joining with him for a bounty of a thousand dollars after which Will invites one of his old partners, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) with him. The film boasts three powerful performances by Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Gene Hackman but what sets this western apart from others is that it does not glorify violence but a complete reversal of that. Nicely filmed & firmly executed, Unforgiven is Eastwood's homage to Sergio Leone's westerns and is a bold statement against its own heritage & a superb tale of moral ambiguity.

    I haven't seen many westerns being honest ; they were quite a bit before my time but this one movie has re-fuelled my interest in the entire genre ; its that good. Eastwood directs this and he does an impeccable job with expert pacing, genuine thrills and plenty of tension. Hackman is your ideal villain ; brutal yet intelligent to a degree and he steals every scene he's in. Whenever he's on screen you can feel the suspension in the atmosphere ; he is such an intimidating individual. And did I mention this movie has Morgan Freeman in ? The cast is just pure class and everyone plays their roles to perfection. However, although the story revolves around the women at the bar, I felt that they featured a little too much in the movie, ever so slightly taking the limelight away from our hero, Clint. The story does take a little while to get going it must be admitted , but once your sucked in it will have your attention right until the grand finale. 'Unforgiven' is only one of three westerns to win the Oscar for 'best picture' and you can understand why. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie , the best of the Eastwood era.

    So yeah, another review by the guy that makes reviews for you, the guy that is searching for a movie to watch! Lets get to it: I gave 9 to the movie because it has a ending and it was so good by the time it reached the end that I really wanted more. So why should you watch this movie and when? You should watch this movie if you are feeling western! This movie has the western structure well developed: a main group of 'outlaws' that are searching to do good as well as some bastard folk that want just the opposite. That resumes why you should watch this if you came here feeling western... but and the other reasons? This movie has a thing that I love in movies: good characters! All of them have more than just a image, they are deep, they have back stories and they live to them in non obvious ways. The characters show their guts! Finally for the bad, maybe the ending of the movie was too dark for the camera? Or that was something wanted because of the meaning of seeing little. Still, the end could be a bit different with some more loose ends. That would make this a western masterpiece.

On his way back to survival, he marches along with his old time pal and a new rookie assassin. He encounters a cop (Hackman) who is trying to shoo away assassins from the country and prevent any further killing. What is characterised by a slow buildup, the ending is not as dramatic and shies away from any over the top action. Yet for its subtlety I would give the movie the above ratings. Acting - Eastwood,Freeman and Hackman do a wonderful job, with excellent dialogue delivery and great character.

    Unforgiven An outstanding movie to capture the old west, if you expect to see a Spaghetti Western you might be disappointed the way I see it is a beautiful last chapter to the Man with no name, which Sergio Leone created back in 1964. Clint Eastwood as Director I feel he did a outstanding job to show a man who was a thief and a killer. where his wife changing his life around, I won't say any more than that. Every Character feels authentic that they belong in the old west. Morgan Freeman Is fantastic as always, Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek are the real sand outs for me.

    I never got what is so great about this movie. At least other Eastwood Westerns could entertain. Even "Pale Rider", a pale hybrid of "Shane" and "High Plains Drifter", was better than this, entertainment wise. Whatever message of anti-violence in the film made no impression on me. John Wayne's final film "The Shootist" was better at that with the last scene in the saloon where Ron Howard throws the gun away and John Wayne nods in agreement and dies. Certainly the director of that movie, Don Siegel, were he still alive at the time, would have done a better job with "Unforgiven", as he had as director of earlier Eastwood films. It was only Eastwood's aging that allowed him to make this particular kind of Western, and with that aging came a consistent decline of quality in his output. Not that any of his movies are all that great to begin with. None of them inspire. Not even this "message" Western. It needed a much more involving story to relay its "message".

    Money must have a lot to do with the story of "Unforgiven" because it's the name of the lead character, William Munny, just spelled different (writers are clever like that). William Munny is, by his own admission, a heartless murderer of everything that ever walked or crawled, women and children included. But it's only because he was bad, wickedly bad, and it seems he was drunk, real drunk, most of the time. And so bad and drunk, he murdered people, lots of people. But that was then, he's a changed man now, everybody deserves a second chance, even heartless drunken murderers. But old (and bad) habits die hard, as hard as a gut-shot cowboy. You see, William Munny needs money, and there's money in killing people, a thousand dollars in this particular instance. He needs the money because he's getting old and he's all muddy and so are his kids, all muddy and dirty, and he's the sole caretaker of those two muddy dirty little kids, and another pig, ANOTHER PIG, has fever. OK, so killing pays and William Munny has experience enough, and a thousand dollars is a lot of money, so who needs to be killed, and why? Is it a legal bounty on a fugitive, dead or alive? Nope, it's entirely ILLEGAL, it's not a bounty it's a contract killing, it's murder for hire. You see, a whore got cut up by some drunken cowboy who didn't think it was funny that the whore he was paying would insult his manhood (if you know what I mean), and the local whore Union wasn't satisfied that justice had been done for the laughing cut-up whore, and so a contract was put out by the Union, for the murder of two cowboys... I'm not sure why two cowboys, maybe they both cut her up, it was pretty dark, maybe they took turns (it is a whorehouse). And so William Munny is going to murder the two cowboys for the whores, for a thousand dollars, not because he really wants to but because ANOTHER PIG has fever. But wait, if you thought all you would get for your enjoyment was two lousy murders, no way, William Munny deals in bulk and volume, he kills everything that walks or crawls, and so once he starts in drinking again, BANG! He kills the guy who owns the whorehouse/saloon (because of how the place is decorated), and that's OK because that guy was ugly and greasy and he owns a whorehouse... But William Munny also kills the Sheriff and just about the whole danged Sheriff's Department, including the one-armed Deputy and young Deputy Andy and the fat Deputy too (shot in the back). And after William Munny shot them all, and with the one-armed Deputy still barely alive groaning to lift his gun up, Munny shot him again (in what seemed like the groin) just for the fun of it I guess. Why did he shoot all those people, what did Andy and one-arm and fat man do to deserve being murdered? Nothing as far as I know, but William Munny (and Clint Eastwood) shoot people, lots of people, and they do it for money, lots of money. A Great American Hero, William Munny or Clint Eastwood or both. Whores everywhere are safer tonight, they have their avenger, and all it cost was a thousand dollars. Also, it's implied in the heartwarming epilogue that the dirty kids got cleaned up and moved out of that pig sty, and Pa invested well in Dry Goods, and everybody lived happily ever after except all the cowboys and Deputies and Sheriff who got gunned down in a drunken murderous cold-blooded shooting rampage. And the PIG? His fever broke, whatever it was it passed, and so of course they slaughtered him... "Because bacon taste's GOOD, pork chops taste GOOD!"

    I agree that this is a great Western movie of the 20th Century -- it is certainly not typical with the reason for the Action and Conflict being the aggrieved women themselves. The cast of characters as developed by David Webb Peoples and director/producer Clint Eastwood are a sordid bunch. We see the earthy and grim parts of a lot of the "Wild West" and learn that Gun Control is not just a measure of the contemporary U.S. political groupings. I don't quite think that the main character is an anti-hero but he does seem a bit like a reformed addict pushed to the breaking point. It is not for the young and over-sensitive. UNFORGIVEN (1992) is a good example of a two-hour feature that doesn't need the big tech-effects to keep us thrilled and on the edges of our seats. It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the "bad" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an "8" *

It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the "bad" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an "8" *

    I won't add much to what have already told the other users. They have all explained. Far better than i'll do. YES YES YES, that's the best Clint Eastwood's film ever made. As an actor, I mean; although as a director, it's ALSO a masterpiece. But as an actor, I have never liked Clint; always the same kind of characters, except maybe in HONKYTONK MAN and WHITE HUNTER... where he gives us unpredictable performances. But in his westerns, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, PALE RIDER, I hate his characters, all alike. In Harry Calahan, well...Nearly the same too. So, in UNFORGIVEN, his character is really different. A genuine bad guy who plays the good guy. Gene Hackman is here the perfect contrary. The good town sheriff who protects his fellow citizens and plays "the bad guy". Don't forget Eastwood's characters's sentence, just before he kills Hackman: "Yes, I have killed women and children..." Have you ever heard a hero say this in a movie? In this movie everything is mixed up, if you compare to other films of this kind. And that's what I love. No real hero here. A pure masterpiece.

    Unforgiven is an excellent film that probably would get a B+ rating for me for most of the film until it got to its astonishing climax that is one of the best ever. The film is good with its characters, story, and the killer climax. The film begins with a reading of what happened with William Munny and what he was and who helped him changed. Then it goes to present day and we meet William Munny and an offer to help give him money to help his family, but involves going back to killing. As two cowboys assaulted a prostitute and sliced her up. He accepts because he needs to money and gathers his old partner, Ned, to help with the killing. The film has some very good characters with Eastwood as the changed trying to stay true to his new self but changes when Ned is killed and he is filled with rage. Freeman is good as Ned, a crack shot but talks big with the Kid as the kid tries to act tough. Hackman was excellent as the mean sheriff who is the big tough guy of town and dares people with his and their lives. The story is a good complex story that is pretty good to follow and is done very well. The best part is its climax when Eastwood goes to town for the revenge of the death of Ned. He goes in the bar where there is some sort of meeting with Hackman there and most of the other cowboys, in fact all of them pretty much. He shoots the bar tender and then Hackman before shooting up the bar and watching the others flee. Hackman then tries to attack one more time but is killed for good. Then as Eastwood leaves, he threatens the people who are living to not touch with or he'll kill them, and their family, and the town. The film is one of the best westerns ever and one of my favorite Eastwood movies ever. Me: 4.5/5 Audience: 4.15/5

    A western that completely defies the entire myth of the Old Wild West, Unforgiven presents Clint Eastwood in command both in front & behind the camera and is a fine drama depicting the dusk of a genre. It tells the story of a retired merciless assassin named William Munny (Clint Eastwood), who ties up his laces for one last time when a young bloke comes up with an offer of joining with him for a bounty of a thousand dollars after which Will invites one of his old partners, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) with him. The film boasts three powerful performances by Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Gene Hackman but what sets this western apart from others is that it does not glorify violence but a complete reversal of that. Nicely filmed & firmly executed, Unforgiven is Eastwood's homage to Sergio Leone's westerns and is a bold statement against its own heritage & a superb tale of moral ambiguity.

    I haven't seen many westerns being honest ; they were quite a bit before my time but this one movie has re-fuelled my interest in the entire genre ; its that good. Eastwood directs this and he does an impeccable job with expert pacing, genuine thrills and plenty of tension. Hackman is your ideal villain ; brutal yet intelligent to a degree and he steals every scene he's in. Whenever he's on screen you can feel the suspension in the atmosphere ; he is such an intimidating individual. And did I mention this movie has Morgan Freeman in ? The cast is just pure class and everyone plays their roles to perfection. However, although the story revolves around the women at the bar, I felt that they featured a little too much in the movie, ever so slightly taking the limelight away from our hero, Clint. The story does take a little while to get going it must be admitted , but once your sucked in it will have your attention right until the grand finale. 'Unforgiven' is only one of three westerns to win the Oscar for 'best picture' and you can understand why. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie , the best of the Eastwood era.

    So yeah, another review by the guy that makes reviews for you, the guy that is searching for a movie to watch! Lets get to it: I gave 9 to the movie because it has a ending and it was so good by the time it reached the end that I really wanted more. So why should you watch this movie and when? You should watch this movie if you are feeling western! This movie has the western structure well developed: a main group of 'outlaws' that are searching to do good as well as some bastard folk that want just the opposite. That resumes why you should watch this if you came here feeling western... but and the other reasons? This movie has a thing that I love in movies: good characters! All of them have more than just a image, they are deep, they have back stories and they live to them in non obvious ways. The characters show their guts! Finally for the bad, maybe the ending of the movie was too dark for the camera? Or that was something wanted because of the meaning of seeing little. Still, the end could be a bit different with some more loose ends. That would make this a western masterpiece.

    Unforgiven An outstanding movie to capture the old west, if you expect to see a Spaghetti Western you might be disappointed the way I see it is a beautiful last chapter to the Man with no name, which Sergio Leone created back in 1964. Clint Eastwood as Director I feel he did a outstanding job to show a man who was a thief and a killer. where his wife changing his life around, I won't say any more than that. Every Character feels authentic that they belong in the old west. Morgan Freeman Is fantastic as always, Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek are the real sand outs for me.

    I never got what is so great about this movie. At least other Eastwood Westerns could entertain. Even "Pale Rider", a pale hybrid of "Shane" and "High Plains Drifter", was better than this, entertainment wise. Whatever message of anti-violence in the film made no impression on me. John Wayne's final film "The Shootist" was better at that with the last scene in the saloon where Ron Howard throws the gun away and John Wayne nods in agreement and dies. Certainly the director of that movie, Don Siegel, were he still alive at the time, would have done a better job with "Unforgiven", as he had as director of earlier Eastwood films. It was only Eastwood's aging that allowed him to make this particular kind of Western, and with that aging came a consistent decline of quality in his output. Not that any of his movies are all that great to begin with. None of them inspire. Not even this "message" Western. It needed a much more involving story to relay its "message".

    Money must have a lot to do with the story of "Unforgiven" because it's the name of the lead character, William Munny, just spelled different (writers are clever like that). William Munny is, by his own admission, a heartless murderer of everything that ever walked or crawled, women and children included. But it's only because he was bad, wickedly bad, and it seems he was drunk, real drunk, most of the time. And so bad and drunk, he murdered people, lots of people. But that was then, he's a changed man now, everybody deserves a second chance, even heartless drunken murderers. But old (and bad) habits die hard, as hard as a gut-shot cowboy. You see, William Munny needs money, and there's money in killing people, a thousand dollars in this particular instance. He needs the money because he's getting old and he's all muddy and so are his kids, all muddy and dirty, and he's the sole caretaker of those two muddy dirty little kids, and another pig, ANOTHER PIG, has fever. OK, so killing pays and William Munny has experience enough, and a thousand dollars is a lot of money, so who needs to be killed, and why? Is it a legal bounty on a fugitive, dead or alive? Nope, it's entirely ILLEGAL, it's not a bounty it's a contract killing, it's murder for hire. You see, a whore got cut up by some drunken cowboy who didn't think it was funny that the whore he was paying would insult his manhood (if you know what I mean), and the local whore Union wasn't satisfied that justice had been done for the laughing cut-up whore, and so a contract was put out by the Union, for the murder of two cowboys... I'm not sure why two cowboys, maybe they both cut her up, it was pretty dark, maybe they took turns (it is a whorehouse). And so William Munny is going to murder the two cowboys for the whores, for a thousand dollars, not because he really wants to but because ANOTHER PIG has fever. But wait, if you thought all you would get for your enjoyment was two lousy murders, no way, William Munny deals in bulk and volume, he kills everything that walks or crawls, and so once he starts in drinking again, BANG! He kills the guy who owns the whorehouse/saloon (because of how the place is decorated), and that's OK because that guy was ugly and greasy and he owns a whorehouse... But William Munny also kills the Sheriff and just about the whole danged Sheriff's Department, including the one-armed Deputy and young Deputy Andy and the fat Deputy too (shot in the back). And after William Munny shot them all, and with the one-armed Deputy still barely alive groaning to lift his gun up, Munny shot him again (in what seemed like the groin) just for the fun of it I guess. Why did he shoot all those people, what did Andy and one-arm and fat man do to deserve being murdered? Nothing as far as I know, but William Munny (and Clint Eastwood) shoot people, lots of people, and they do it for money, lots of money. A Great American Hero, William Munny or Clint Eastwood or both. Whores everywhere are safer tonight, they have their avenger, and all it cost was a thousand dollars. Also, it's implied in the heartwarming epilogue that the dirty kids got cleaned up and moved out of that pig sty, and Pa invested well in Dry Goods, and everybody lived happily ever after except all the cowboys and Deputies and Sheriff who got gunned down in a drunken murderous cold-blooded shooting rampage. And the PIG? His fever broke, whatever it was it passed, and so of course they slaughtered him... "Because bacon taste's GOOD, pork chops taste GOOD!"

    I agree that this is a great Western movie of the 20th Century -- it is certainly not typical with the reason for the Action and Conflict being the aggrieved women themselves. The cast of characters as developed by David Webb Peoples and director/producer Clint Eastwood are a sordid bunch. We see the earthy and grim parts of a lot of the "Wild West" and learn that Gun Control is not just a measure of the contemporary U.S. political groupings. I don't quite think that the main character is an anti-hero but he does seem a bit like a reformed addict pushed to the breaking point. It is not for the young and over-sensitive. UNFORGIVEN (1992) is a good example of a two-hour feature that doesn't need the big tech-effects to keep us thrilled and on the edges of our seats. It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the "bad" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an "8" *

We see the earthy and grim parts of a lot of the "Wild West" and learn that Gun Control is not just a measure of the contemporary U.S. political groupings. I don't quite think that the main character is an anti-hero but he does seem a bit like a reformed addict pushed to the breaking point. It is not for the young and over-sensitive. UNFORGIVEN (1992) is a good example of a two-hour feature that doesn't need the big tech-effects to keep us thrilled and on the edges of our seats. It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the "bad" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an "8" *

    I won't add much to what have already told the other users. They have all explained. Far better than i'll do. YES YES YES, that's the best Clint Eastwood's film ever made. As an actor, I mean; although as a director, it's ALSO a masterpiece. But as an actor, I have never liked Clint; always the same kind of characters, except maybe in HONKYTONK MAN and WHITE HUNTER... where he gives us unpredictable performances. But in his westerns, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, PALE RIDER, I hate his characters, all alike. In Harry Calahan, well...Nearly the same too. So, in UNFORGIVEN, his character is really different. A genuine bad guy who plays the good guy. Gene Hackman is here the perfect contrary. The good town sheriff who protects his fellow citizens and plays "the bad guy". Don't forget Eastwood's characters's sentence, just before he kills Hackman: "Yes, I have killed women and children..." Have you ever heard a hero say this in a movie? In this movie everything is mixed up, if you compare to other films of this kind. And that's what I love. No real hero here. A pure masterpiece.

    Unforgiven is an excellent film that probably would get a B+ rating for me for most of the film until it got to its astonishing climax that is one of the best ever. The film is good with its characters, story, and the killer climax. The film begins with a reading of what happened with William Munny and what he was and who helped him changed. Then it goes to present day and we meet William Munny and an offer to help give him money to help his family, but involves going back to killing. As two cowboys assaulted a prostitute and sliced her up. He accepts because he needs to money and gathers his old partner, Ned, to help with the killing. The film has some very good characters with Eastwood as the changed trying to stay true to his new self but changes when Ned is killed and he is filled with rage. Freeman is good as Ned, a crack shot but talks big with the Kid as the kid tries to act tough. Hackman was excellent as the mean sheriff who is the big tough guy of town and dares people with his and their lives. The story is a good complex story that is pretty good to follow and is done very well. The best part is its climax when Eastwood goes to town for the revenge of the death of Ned. He goes in the bar where there is some sort of meeting with Hackman there and most of the other cowboys, in fact all of them pretty much. He shoots the bar tender and then Hackman before shooting up the bar and watching the others flee. Hackman then tries to attack one more time but is killed for good. Then as Eastwood leaves, he threatens the people who are living to not touch with or he'll kill them, and their family, and the town. The film is one of the best westerns ever and one of my favorite Eastwood movies ever. Me: 4.5/5 Audience: 4.15/5
