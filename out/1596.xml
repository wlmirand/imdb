 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  It has been 73 years since Alex failed and the Humans lost the Cyborg Wars. Since then, the Humans have been enslaved. Scientists have developed a new DNA strain, which could signal the end of the Cyborgs, and they inject it into a volunteer. When the Cyborgs learn of the woman and the baby they list both for termination. To escape, she takes a stolen Cyborg ship and transports back in time to East Africa in 1980, where the mother is killed, but the baby is saved. It takes 20 years, but the Cyborg bounty hunter Nebula finally locates the girl, named Alex, and travels back in time to terminate her.

    Bodybuilder Sue Price plays Alex, a girl who grew up in an African tribe. Everybody lies to her about her true origins, but once she passes a toughness test and beats her main tribe bully to a pulp, the main man finally lets her see the time machine she came out of 20 odd years ago. Meanwhile a cyborg called Nebula who looks like a cross between The Fly, Predator and the evil alien wife from the Outer Limits episode, zeroes in on Alex and sets on a path of total annihilation. That's how this film starts and it's relatively well made for a video feature. The rest of the movie is non stop Sue running around in little clothing, kicking, stabbing and shooting Nebula and various goons and that's it. But, to Albert Pyun's credit, he's smart enough to blow up as many buildings as he can on camera. What this movie lacks in plot, and it really does lack in plot, it makes up for with explosions. And Sue Price, who's quite feminine looking despite being ripped as hell.

    Sequels in general are hard to do. If the previous film is well liked then the filmmakers of number 2 have got to try and live up to that. But if we're talking sequels to direct to video or limited release films the bar may not be so high. The first 'Nemesis,' a film that is probably director Albert Pyun's most talked about, was a flop at the box office and quickly went to video. It would be discovered by film lovers who enjoy a good piece of cheesy low budget entertainment from time to time. It's not great art by any stretch of the imagination, but it has it's charms. Pyun would go on to make 3 sequels, all shot back to back, and I'm sure no one expected something better than the first. This first sequel certainly isn't that, but it has a certain charm all it's own. Pros: Actors are game. Nice score. Beautiful desert landscape and photography. Effortless pace. Pyun infuses this with some style. Also kudos to him for not repeating himself and instead trying to take the series in a new direction, while still having some ties to the first film. Impressive android suits. Cons: Virtually plot less. Dated visual effects. Many disposable characters. Lacking in memorable action scenes. Some plot holes. Final thoughts: I have to admit I was disappointed that this wasn't a new adventure for the character of Alex Rain from the first film. I wanted to see him up against some new opposing force, but I guess it just wasn't meant to be. What we got instead is still fun to watch if you enjoy these type of movies and still makes a for a good double feature with the original. Now I just need to track down Nemesis 3: Time Lapse. My rating: 3/5

    In 2077, the cyborgs have won the war against humanity which they started in the first part. Baby Alex is sent back in time to 1980, so she can safely grow up in the 20th century - and become the star of part 2. Stranded in Africa, the girl is raised by a native tribe who is one day attacked by Nebula, a warrior from the future. Her enemies did obviously discover Alex finally, and she has got only a knife at first to fight the heavily armored cyborg. So she is mostly on the run, also attacked by human enemies, (a rebel army), and on top of that, she also tries to rescue 2 American girls. Sounds like a mission impossible, doesn't it? But Sue Price in her first movie is quite a show with her muscles. Pyun dared giving the Stallone/Schwarzenegger role to a woman, and then look at the locations: a fight against a robot - that's something you'd expect to happen on a space station or a dark rainy city a la Blade Runner. Instead, Pyun takes us into a bright, sunny Africa (shot in Arizona, though) and the first third of the movie is just about Alex' initiation as a warrior, with dialogs in the tribe's language and subtitles. Strong colors and wide angle shots of barren landscapes make it look really good. The remaining two thirds of Nemesis 2" are less remarkable: a constant battle, you can't get some popcorn before the next grenade explodes. Since the hunter has got a lot more technical options (radar, infra-red, audio scanning, laser, whatever), his prey stands no chance normally, but has a strong survival instinct. The ending titles already announce Nemesis 3: Time lapse". I watched the 4 Nemesis movies (which I watched first in the 1990s) again now in chronological order for my reviews and voted 7/7/5/5.

    I first saw this film a decade ago hidden in the nite program of a cable network. Only got half of it as I tuned in while it was already running and fell asleep before it was off. But that muscle babe kept me interested in seeing the whole thing. So now with the full DVD box of Nemesis I-IV available I could enjoy it in full. On the contrary of many receptions here I am not in favor of Nemesis I. It is over ambitious and still crap. But Nemesis II catches what I would expect from a good action flick w/o budget - short introduction of persons, setting of characters and scene and then: Action! Not much suspense but a good laugh from time to time about plot holes so big even Sue Price could push through her broad shoulders . So for example the Cyborg first tries desperately to kill our hero whereas later revealing he would like to kidnap her alive. Sue Price is really a feast for the eyes if you're into strong women. About her acting: if I had so many big muscles to co-ordinate I doubt I would find the time to control the small ones in my face to give it different expressions. By the way Mr. Pyun had a wise choice of putting the storyline into African desert as only here our female hero can be densely clad to show mostly all of her beautiful body. So all in all well entertaining and worth the time watching. I look forward to pt. III and IV in my DVD box with anticipation.

    Years have past since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie) stumbled onto the horrific plot that involved replacing humans with machines however since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we lost, now a superwoman of sorts who is the daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (She also inherits only half of his minimal acting ability) which I think is the films minimal connection to the first, however when the superwoman is created she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter from the future hunts her down in this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, that I can see why people liked even though I was no fan of said film. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful look and provide tons of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 doesn't even have that ambition, it's a cheap rip off of The Terminator with a muscled female who is so low on acting ability she makes Olivier Gruner seem like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original. I'll admit I was no fan of the original but it deserved a better follow up than this. The original also featured a good cast like Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley this one features nobody and this time it's just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe. In fact after I saw this, it inspired to add a half star to the original. * out of 4-(Bad)

    In this sequel to the original & surprisingly good NEMESIS, ALEX RAIN, a female warrior named after the original hero ALEX RAIN, from quiet a few years ago, is the only one who can save humanity from a lethal cyborg who wants to wipe out our planet. Second film is totally worthless & cheap, despite it's interesting story & villains, NEMESIS 2 is an extremely dull sequel, that nowhere near matches up with the thrills or action not to mention acting talent of the original, no wonder OLIVER GRUNER didn't want to come back! Like I mentioned above in my brief synopsis of the films plot, ALEX RAIN is a female warrior named after Gruners character & that's another problem, NEMESIS 2, uses the old clich&eacute; storyline in this case, we are informed that the hero of the original failed to stop the cyborgs & was killed. I mean it's the easiest way out of getting out of writing in the original hero of the movie when you can't fit him/her into a new storyline or can't get the old actors who played them back, or if they want to compose a new hero, just kill the original hero/heroine off, say that they died many years ago of some disease, have them fighting bad guys elsewhere, or just ignore the previous movie or movies & start an in name only sequel or ignore them & say they never happened. But no matter what the excuse may have been, I doubt that it would have made this movie or it's sequels any better, while the stories & villains were well written, it's to cheap to be any good mostly the whole movie is set in the desert (an affordable location) & the action is dull, as are the performances & even ALBERT PYUN'S direction is not up to what it was in the original. Skip this one, even if you liked the first one, you'll probably have a hard time sitting through it & the next two installments. Supposedly this was shot back to back with Parts 3 & 4 & no doubt the budget the producers had wasn't all that big to begin with. No wonder these are so dull & cheap looking...Followed by NEMESIS III: PREY HARDER. *1/2 stars

    And that is the only reason I posses this DVD. Now I haven't seen the first Nemesis film, but I did check the info out of it and I here by say: What? Why? Because in the first film Alex was male. But then again the first one was set in the future, so maybe this Alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make Alex female this time. Who knows, at least it wasn't addressed in the film in any way. Here's a quick summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby then (or how ever you want, as it was, is, in the future) escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the 80's Africa. There mommy gets killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in a African tribe. Then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and Alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg. So there. Does sound familiar, doesn't it?. Terminator isn't the only film being ripped here, Predator gets its fair share too and I think the first Fly movie, the Vincent Price one, gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head from. Lets see, what else? Okay, the film was quite standard small budget flick, but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90's film. It would have looked okay for a 80's flick how ever. Biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 isn't the crappiest piece of cinema I've had pleasure (?) to watch but it does come damn close. I won't say a thing about acting, because let's be honest here: did anyone expect Oscar worthy performances here? Oh well... at least I did find Sue Price hot in that amazonian warrior way. A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There isn't a lot of pros about the over all quality. And despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sense. A camp movie rating: 4/10 I did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film, so it does have small merits in it.

    This is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans! I think that Sue Price did a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. She has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Though not a film of great value and Sue Price's acting skills not the best to have met in my life, the movie itself was something awesome, a priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi films, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. I really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity it hasn't shown yet on DVD :-(

    i was about 10 years old when i first saw this movie, and to be a kid at that age i thought this movie was great, but i cannot remember much about this movie, except that their was a dark blue android after a body builder woman i think her name was Alex. But i thought it was a good movie and i would like to see it again sometime, i have only seen the movie once and really enjoyed it, i watched it with my older sister at the time and their were a few good moments like where the dark blue thing "Nemesis" i take it was running after Alex and no matter what Alex did "Nemesis" could not be stopped - really cool!. But some people have put this movie on a down why!? give it a chance, but then again i could be very very wrong since as a child these movies seem unstoppable. if anyone has got this movie id love to know please contact me. and i have tried E-Bay, but no luck :(

    This Film was Great when i first seen it, that was about 10 years ago. i cannot hardly remember this film but i can remember that cyborg (nemesis) i just call him or it "Arnie", and if it had a woman who was a body builder who played Alex i think her role name was then this is the film i want to watch one last time! if anyone out their has this film could they please get in contact? i know i have a really slim chance of finding anyone who even commented on this but its a shot I'm willing to take! but this film was great when i watched it, i mean a cyborg that cannot be killed following and trying to kill Alex it was great when i was little, but the scenes seemed enclosed and cramped, I've never seen the first but i have been told its better than this one if its true then maybe i was wrong and my little mind played tricks on me, anyways thanks ghostfacekillah20032004@hotmail.com

Here's a quick summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby then (or how ever you want, as it was, is, in the future) escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the 80's Africa. There mommy gets killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in a African tribe. Then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and Alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg. So there. Does sound familiar, doesn't it?. Terminator isn't the only film being ripped here, Predator gets its fair share too and I think the first Fly movie, the Vincent Price one, gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head from. Lets see, what else? Okay, the film was quite standard small budget flick, but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90's film. It would have looked okay for a 80's flick how ever. Biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 isn't the crappiest piece of cinema I've had pleasure (?) to watch but it does come damn close. I won't say a thing about acting, because let's be honest here: did anyone expect Oscar worthy performances here? Oh well... at least I did find Sue Price hot in that amazonian warrior way. A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There isn't a lot of pros about the over all quality. And despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sense. A camp movie rating: 4/10 I did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film, so it does have small merits in it.

    This is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans! I think that Sue Price did a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. She has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Though not a film of great value and Sue Price's acting skills not the best to have met in my life, the movie itself was something awesome, a priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi films, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. I really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity it hasn't shown yet on DVD :-(

    i was about 10 years old when i first saw this movie, and to be a kid at that age i thought this movie was great, but i cannot remember much about this movie, except that their was a dark blue android after a body builder woman i think her name was Alex. But i thought it was a good movie and i would like to see it again sometime, i have only seen the movie once and really enjoyed it, i watched it with my older sister at the time and their were a few good moments like where the dark blue thing "Nemesis" i take it was running after Alex and no matter what Alex did "Nemesis" could not be stopped - really cool!. But some people have put this movie on a down why!? give it a chance, but then again i could be very very wrong since as a child these movies seem unstoppable. if anyone has got this movie id love to know please contact me. and i have tried E-Bay, but no luck :(

    This Film was Great when i first seen it, that was about 10 years ago. i cannot hardly remember this film but i can remember that cyborg (nemesis) i just call him or it "Arnie", and if it had a woman who was a body builder who played Alex i think her role name was then this is the film i want to watch one last time! if anyone out their has this film could they please get in contact? i know i have a really slim chance of finding anyone who even commented on this but its a shot I'm willing to take! but this film was great when i watched it, i mean a cyborg that cannot be killed following and trying to kill Alex it was great when i was little, but the scenes seemed enclosed and cramped, I've never seen the first but i have been told its better than this one if its true then maybe i was wrong and my little mind played tricks on me, anyways thanks ghostfacekillah20032004@hotmail.com
